Boeing Capital Corporation Segment In the commercial aircraft market, BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Commercial Airplanes customers. In the space and defense markets, BCC primarily arranges and structures financing solutions for our BDS government customers. BCCs portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases, finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and investments. Financial and Other Business Information See the Summary of Business Segment Data and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information, including revenues and earnings from operations, for each of the major business segments. Intellectual Property We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property  rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property rights or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreements. Non-U.S. Sales See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding non-U.S. sales. Research and Development Research and development expenditures involve experimentation, design, development and related test activities for defense systems, new and derivative jet aircraft including both commercial and military, advance space and other company-sponsored product development. These are expensed as incurred including amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on U.S. government contracts. Our total research and development expense amounted to $6.5 billion, $3.8 billion and $3.9 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These amounts are net of 787-related research and development cost sharing payments from suppliers of $0, $50 million and $130 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Research and development expense in 2009 includes $2.7 billion of production costs related to the first three flight test 787 aircraft that cannot be sold due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to the aircraft. Research and development costs also include bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services, as well as costs incurred in excess of amounts estimated to be recoverable under cost-sharing research and development agreements. Bid and proposal costs were $343 million, $330 million and $306 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Research and development highlights for each of the major business segments are discussed in more detail in Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition on pages 21  38. Employees Total workforce level at December 31, 2009 was 157,100. As of December 31, 2009, our principal collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions: ##TABLE_START Union  Percent of our Employees Represented  Status of the Agreements with the Union The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM)  18%  We have two major agreements; one expiring in June of 2010 and one in September of 2012. The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA)  13%  We have two major agreements expiring in October of 2012. The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW)  2%  We have one major agreement expiring in April of 2010. ##TABLE_END  Competition The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We face aggressive international competitors, including Airbus, who are intent on increasing their market share. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity. BDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company and General Dynamics Corporation. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), the parent of Airbus, continue to pursue a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In addition, certain of our competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2010 with many international firms pursuing announced intentions of increasing their U.S. presence. Regulatory Matters Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our international markets. U.S. Government Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance measurements. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and can require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default. Commercial Aircraft. In the United States, our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Internationally, similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Joint Aviation Authorities. Environmental. Our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if more stringent clean-up standards are imposed, additional contamination is discovered and/or clean-up costs are higher than estimated.  A Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site, the statutory framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. International. Our international sales are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, investment, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. International sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks. Raw Materials We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take a year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of companies. Suppliers We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and program/contract profitability, thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. We are also dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices. A number of our suppliers have made assertions for higher prices or other contractual compensation relief which could affect program/contract profitability. Seasonality No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past performance due to a variety of factors including, without limitation, the following: We depend heavily upon commercial airline customers, our suppliers and the worldwide market, which are subject to unique risks. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of major commercial airlines, some of which have encountered financial difficulties. We can make no assurance that any customer will purchase additional products or services from us after our contract with the customer ends. In addition, financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, of any of the major commercial airlines could significantly reduce our revenues, even under existing contracts, and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers. Several commercial airlines, including certain of our customers, have filed for or emerged from bankruptcy protection. Our ability to deliver aircraft on time depends on a variety of factors, which are subject to unique risks. Our ability to deliver jet aircraft on schedule is dependent upon a variety of factors, including execution of internal performance plans, availability of raw materials (such as aluminum, titanium and composites) and internally and supplier produced parts and structures, conversion of raw materials into parts and assemblies, performance of suppliers and subcontractors and regulatory certification. The failure of any or all of these factors could result in significant out-of-sequence work and disrupted process flows adversely affect production schedules and program/contract profitability, the latter through increased costs as well as possible customer and/or supplier claims or assertions. In addition, the introduction of new commercial aircraft programs and major derivative aircraft involves increased risk associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. For example, recent modifications required on the side-of-body section of our 787 aircraft have resulted in testing and delivery delays. Market conditions have a significant impact on our ability to sell aircraft into the future. The worldwide market for commercial jet aircraft is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability, both in developed and emerging countries. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline industry profitability, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, terrorism, disease outbreaks, environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operations, technological changes and price and other competitive factors.  Our commercial aircraft customers may request to cancel, modify or reschedule orders. We generally make sales under aircraft purchase agreements that may, for a variety of reasons, become the subject of cancellation, modification or rescheduling. Changes in the economic environment and the financial condition of the airline industry and our customers could result in customer requests to reschedule or cancel contractual orders. Our contracts have specific provisions relating to schedule and performance and failure to deliver airplanes in accordance with such provisions could result in cancellations and/or claims for compensation. Any such cancellations, modification, rescheduling or claims could significantly reduce our backlog, revenues, profitability and cash flows. Our commercial aircraft production rates could change. Production rate reductions could cause us to incur disruption and other costs and result in infrastructure costs being allocated to a smaller quantity of airplanes, all of which could reduce our profitability. The introduction of new aircraft program and/or higher orders for our aircraft could lead to production rate increases in order to meet the delivery schedules. Failure to successfully implement any production rate changes could lead to extended delivery commitments, and depending on the length of delay in meeting delivery commitments, additional costs and customers rescheduling their deliveries or terminating their related contract with us. We depend heavily on U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks. In 2009, 43% of our revenues were derived from U.S. government contracts. In addition to normal business risks, our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique risks, some of which are beyond our control. The funding of U.S. government programs is subject to congressional appropriations . Many of the U.S. government programs in which we participate may last several years; however, these programs are normally funded annually. Changes in military strategy and priorities may affect our future procurement opportunities and existing programs. Long-term government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation, or delay, if appropriations for subsequent performance periods are not made. In addition, the U.S. DoD budget is under pressure due to competing national priorities. The termination or reduction of funding for existing or new U.S. government programs could result in a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and financial position. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate our contracts. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and at its convenience upon payment for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. Modification, curtailment or termination of one or more of our major programs or contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our contract costs are subject to audits by U.S. government agencies . U.S. government representatives may audit the costs we incur on our U.S. government contracts, including allocated indirect costs. Such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. We have recorded contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize upon final audit. However, we do not know the outcome of any future audits and adjustments and we may be required to reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. If any audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. Our business is subject to potential U.S. government inquiries and investigations. We are sometimes subject to certain U.S. government inquiries and investigations of our business practices due to our participation in government contracts. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Our U.S. government business is also subject to specific procurement regulations and other requirements. These requirements, although customary in U.S. government contracts, increase our performance and compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future, reducing our margins, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition. Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time and could have a negative effect on our reputation and ability to secure future U.S. government contracts. We enter into fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns. Many of our contracts in BDS and most of our contracts in Commercial Airplanes are on a fixed-price basis. Approximately 50% of BDS revenues are generated from fixed-price contracts. While firm fixed price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. The long term nature of many of our contracts and programs makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed price contracts inherently risky. For example commercial jet aircraft are normally sold on a firm fixed-price basis with an indexed price escalation clause. These escalation clauses account for economic fluctuations over the period of time from sale to delivery which can span many years. A price escalation formula based on pre-defined factors is used to determine the final price of the airplane at the time of customer delivery. Changes in future estimates of the underlying price escalation index can significantly impact estimated revenues and margins in any quarter. Fixed price contracts in our BDS business often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance. If we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, our sales price could be reduced, which would adversely affect our financial condition. Fixed-price development work inherently has more uncertainty than work pursuant to production contracts and, therefore, more variability in estimates of the cost to complete the work. Fixed price development contracts inherently have more uncertainty than fixed price production contracts. Examples of significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include AEWC, International KC-767 Tankers and commercial and military satellites. Examples of significant Commercial Airplanes development programs include the 787 and 747-8. Many of these development programs have very complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays and higher costs to complete. Additionally, price escalation factors may also impact margins by reducing the estimated price of airplanes delivered in the future. Both of these factors may ultimately result in a material charge if the program has or is determined to have a reach forward loss. Successful performance depends on our ability to meet production specifications and delivery rates. If we are unable to perform and deliver to contract requirements, our contract price could be reduced through the incorporation of liquidated damages, termination of the contract for default, or other financially significant exposure. Management uses its best judgment to estimate the cost to perform the work, the price we will eventually be paid and, in the case of commercial programs, the number of units to include in the initial accounting quantity. While we believe the cost and price estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates. Changes to estimates of the program accounting quantity, production costs and rates, learning curve, costs of derivative aircraft, customer negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and certification issues could also result in lower margins or reach-forward losses. We may continue to experience technical and quality issues requiring further delays in schedule or revisions to our cost estimates.  On Commercial Airplanes development programs our ability to sell test aircraft or initial units produced can also affect our results. For example in 2009 we determined that three of the 787 flight test aircraft could not be sold. This resulted in $2.7 billion being accounted for as research and development expense as opposed to being capitalized as inventory. Our inability to sell additional test aircraft could increase future research and development expenses. We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks. Approximately 50% of BDS revenues are generated from cost-type contracting arrangements. Some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Programs whose contracts are primarily cost-type include GMD, BCTM (formerly FCS), P-8A Poseidon, Proprietary programs, Airborne Laser, JTRS, FAB-T and the EA-18G Growler. We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks. Contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit payments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite does not perform to specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance. The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees we ultimately expect to realize is recognized as revenue in the construction period. If the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criteria, customers will not be obligated to continue making in-orbit payments and/or we may be required to provide refunds to the customer and incur significant charges. We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results. Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. Under program accounting, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Such estimates are  reconsidered throughout the life of our programs. Changes in underlying assumptions, supplier performance, circumstances or estimates concerning the selection of the accounting quantity or changes in market conditions, along with a failure to realize predicted costs, may adversely affect future financial performance. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under Managements Discussion and AnalysisCritical Accounting PoliciesContract Accounting/Program Accounting on pages 43-45 and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 56-57 of this Form 10-K. Significant changes in discount rates, actual investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect our earnings, equity, and pension contributions in future periods. Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. The most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension or other postretirement income or expense for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and expected future medical inflation. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to Other comprehensive income. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see Managements Discussion and AnalysisCritical Accounting PoliciesPostretirement Plans on pages 46-47 of this Form 10-K. Although GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or common stock we would contribute to the pension or other postretirement plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and discretionary contributions to improve the plans funded status. Some of our and our suppliers workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages. Approximately 57,000 employees, which constitute approximately 36% of our total workforce, are union represented as of December 31, 2009. We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BMA program production and we may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 14 different U.S. labor organizations and 7 different non-U.S. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions requirements without impacting our financial condition. The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations. Competition within our markets may reduce our procurement of future contracts and sales. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In addition, some of our largest customers could develop the capability to manufacture products or  provide services similar to products that we manufacture or services that we provide. This would result in these customers supplying their own products or services and competing directly with us for sales of these products or services, all of which could significantly reduce our revenues. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not result in reduced revenues and market share. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries. In 2009, sales to non-U.S. customers accounted for approximately 42% of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including: ##TABLE_START   changes in regulatory requirements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   domestic and international government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation requirements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   fluctuations in international currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   volatility in foreign political and economic environments and changes in foreign national priorities and budgets, which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   imposition of taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over various countries; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   economic and geopolitical developments and conditions. ##TABLE_END While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future. The outcome of litigation in which we have been named as a defendant and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could result in significant monetary payments and have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations. We are defendants in a number of litigation matters. These claims may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S government, the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our ownership of certain property. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could result in significant monetary payments (including possible environmental remediation costs) and a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results.  A substantial deterioration in the financial condition of the commercial airline industry or significant changes to the financial or regulatory landscape could have a significant impact on Boeing Capital Corporation, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. BCC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, has substantially all of its portfolio concentrated among commercial airline customers. If terrorist attacks, a serious health epidemic, significant regulatory actions in response to environmental concerns, increases in fuel related costs or other exogenous events were to have an adverse impact on the airline industry, increased requests for financing, significant defaults by airline customers, repossessions of aircraft and/or airline bankruptcies and restructurings could negatively impact the strength of BCCs portfolio and our operating results. In addition, a significant deterioration in the aircraft financing environment, or significant regulatory reforms that increase costs to companies like BCC, could impact BCCs financial position and operating results. Any of these events could have a negative effect on our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. We may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. If we were called upon to fund all outstanding financing commitments, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance or outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures. As part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses, form joint ventures/strategic alliances and divest operations. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends, in part, upon the integration between the businesses involved, the performance of the underlying products, capabilities or technologies and the management of the transacted operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated performance issues, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our results of operations or financial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful. Divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures. We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. While we maintain insurance for certain risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. government, insurance cannot be obtained to protect against all risks and liabilities. It is therefore possible that the amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs.  Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses. Our business may be impacted by disruptions including, but not limited to, threats to physical security, information technology attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or services provided to customers, and could impact our sales, increase our expenses or adversely affect our reputation or our stock price.

For a discussion of contingencies related to legal proceedings, see Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is hereby incorporated by reference. BSSI/SES New Skies During 2007, the SES New Skies (New Skies) NSS-8 satellite, a Boeing 702 model spacecraft, was declared a loss when the Sea Launch Zenit-3SL vehicle carrying the satellite experienced an anomaly during the launch that destroyed the rocket and the payload. In the event of such a launch failure, New Skies had an option under the NSS-8 contract to order a replacement satellite. On December 23, 2009, the parties executed a confidential settlement agreement with respect to all claims arising from the matter. Santa Susana Field Laboratory We possess a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Los Angeles Region (the California Board), which limits the permissible level of certain constituents in storm water discharged from various outfalls at our Santa Susana Field Laboratory site. On June 11, 2008, the California Board issued a Notice of Violation informing us that the California Board has identified 24 discharge violations from our self-monitoring reports covering the period October 1, 2006, through March 31, 2008, and in subsequent communications we have been informed that the California Board believes there may be an additional 11 exceedences for a total of 35 potential discharge violations through February 28, 2009. Each violation, if established, could give rise to assessment of an administrative penalty of up to $10,000, or $25,000 if the matter is ultimately resolved by the California Department of Justice, plus possible additional assessments based upon the volume of water discharged.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we rely extensively on a network of partners, key suppliers and subcontractors around the world. Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses  Commercial Airplanes and Boeing Defense, Space  Security (BDS)  supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services that open new frontiers in aerospace. We focus on producing the airplanes the market demands and we price our products to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security and space to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets often offset. BCC delivers value by supporting our business units and managing overall financing exposure. Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009   2008   2007  Commercial Airplanes  $ 34,051   $ 28,263   $ 33,386  Boeing Defense, Space  Security   33,661    32,047    32,052  Boeing Capital Corporation   660    703    815  Other segment   165    567    308  Unallocated items and eliminations   (256 )   (671 )   (174 ) Total  $ 68,281   $ 60,909   $ 66,387    ##TABLE_END Revenues in 2009 increased by $7,372 million due to higher revenues in Commercial Airplanes and BDS. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $5,788, primarily due to higher commercial airplane deliveries in 2009. Deliveries in 2008 were lower as a result of a labor strike in the prior year. Increases were partially offset by decreases in commercial aviation services and intercompany revenues. BDS revenues increased by $1,614 million, primarily due to higher revenues in Global Services  Support (GSS) and Boeing Military Airplanes (BMA), partially offset by decreases in Network  Space Systems (NSS). BCC revenues decreased by $43 million during the year primarily due to a decrease in the customer financing portfolio. Other segment revenues decreased by $402 million partly due to higher revenues in the prior year from the sale of four C-17 aircraft held under operating lease. Lower Unallocated items and eliminations improved revenues by $415 million primarily due to lower P-8A Poseidon program (P-8A) intercompany revenues recognized by Commercial Airplanes in 2009 compared with 2008.  The decrease in 2008 revenues of $5,478 million compared with 2007, is primarily due to lower revenues at Commercial Airplanes. Commercial Airplanes revenues decreased by $5,123 million, primarily as a result of decreases in new airplane deliveries reflecting the effects of the labor strike, partially offset by higher intercompany revenues and higher pre-strike deliveries and model mix. We delivered 104 fewer airplanes than expected during 2008 due to the strike. This reduced revenue by approximately $6.4 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. BDS revenues were unchanged as revenue growth in GSS was offset by decreases in BMA and NSS. BCC revenues decreased by $112 million primarily due to lower interest income on financing receivables and notes and a decrease in the customer financing portfolio. Other segment revenues increased by $259 million primarily due to the sale of four C-17 aircraft during 2008, that were held under an operating lease. Unallocated items and eliminations changed by $497 million, primarily due to the intercompany elimination of P-8A revenues recognized by Commercial Airplanes. Earnings From Operations The following table summarizes our earnings/(loss) from operations: (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009   2008   2007  Commercial Airplanes   (583 )   1,186   $ 3,584  Boeing Defense, Space  Security   3,299    3,232    3,440  Boeing Capital Corporation   126    162    234  Other segment   (152 )   (307 )   (331 ) Unallocated items and eliminations   (594 )   (323 )   (1,097 ) Total  $ 2,096   $ 3,950   $ 5,830    ##TABLE_END Operating earnings in 2009 decreased by $1,854 million compared with 2008. Commercial Airplanes earnings decreased by $1,769 million primarily due to $2,693 million of costs related to the first three 787 flight test aircraft included in research and development expense as a result of our determination in August 2009 that these aircraft could not be sold. The earnings decrease is also attributable to reach-forward losses on the 747 program which grew by $1,352 million in 2009 which is an increase of $667 million over 2008. Lower commercial aviation services and intercompany earnings also contributed to lower 2009 earnings. These decreases were partially offset by higher commercial airplane deliveries in 2009 compared with 2008. BDS earnings increased by $67 million compared with 2008 primarily due to higher earnings in the BMA segment partially offset by lower earnings in the NSS segment. BCC operating earnings decreased $36 million reflecting lower revenues, higher impairment expense and a provision for losses, partially offset by lower interest expense. Other segment losses decreased by $155 million primarily due to recognition of pre-tax expense of $82 million in the prior year to increase the allowance for losses on customer financing receivables and lower environmental remediation charges compared with the prior year. Unallocated items and eliminations in 2009 reduced earnings by $271 million compared with 2008, which is further explained in the table below. Operating earnings in 2008 decreased by $1,880 million compared with 2007. Commercial Airplanes earnings decreased by $2,398 million compared with the same period in 2007, primarily due to fewer new airplane deliveries resulting from the strike, increased program infrastructure costs related to the strike and revised schedules on 787 and 747-8, and a charge taken on the 747-8 program. Commercial Airplanes research and development expense decreased by $124 million to $2,838 million compared with the same period in 2007, primarily due to lower spending on 787 partially offset by higher spending on 747-8 and lower supplier development cost sharing payments. BDS earnings decreased by $208 million compared with 2007 primarily due to lower earnings in the BMA segment resulting from charges taken on the Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEWC). BCC operating  earnings decreased $72 million reflecting lower revenues and a provision for losses partially offset by lower interest expense. Unallocated items and eliminations in 2008 improved by $774 million compared with 2007, which is further explained in the table below. The most significant items included in Unallocated items and eliminations are shown in the following table: (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009   2008   2007  Share-based plans expense  $ (189 )  $ (149 )  $ (233 ) Deferred compensation expense/(income)   (158 )   223    (51 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations   (264 )   (110 )   (127 ) Pension   110    (208 )   (561 ) Postretirement   (93 )   (79 )   (125 ) Total  $ (594 )  $ (323 )  $ (1,097 )   ##TABLE_END The reduction in Share-based plans expense in 2008 is primarily due to the expiration of certain Performance Shares during 2008 and higher expense acceleration during 2007, resulting from six payouts compared with zero payouts in 2008. Deferred compensation expense increased by $381 million in 2009 and decreased by $274 million in 2008. The year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price and broad stock market conditions. Other unallocated items and eliminations expense increased by $154 million in 2009 primarily due to timing of intercompany expense allocations, elimination of profit on intercompany items and a more favorable insurance adjustment in the same periods of the prior year. Other unallocated items and expense in 2008 includes a charge related to satellite litigation of $100 million, offset by lower performance-based compensation in 2008. Unallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for U.S. government contracting purposes. We recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of $1,816 million, $1,132 million and $1,773 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period. A portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense. Earnings from operations included the following amounts allocated to business segments and Other unallocated items and eliminations. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Pension   Other Postretirement Benefits  Years ended December 31,  2009   2008   2007   2009   2008   2007  Allocated to business segments  $ (989 )  $ (488 )  $ (521 )  $ (522 )  (428 )  (523 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations   110    (208 )   (561 )   (93 )  (79 )  (125 ) Total  $ (879 )  $ (696 )  $ (1,082 )  $ (615 )  (507 )  (648 )   ##TABLE_END  Other Earnings Items (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009   2008   2007  Earnings from operations  $ 2,096   $ 3,950   $ 5,830  Other (expense)/income, net   (26 )   247    484  Interest and debt expense   (339 )   (202 )   (196 ) Earnings before income taxes   1,731    3,995    6,118  Income tax expense   (396 )   (1,341 )   (2,060 ) Net earnings from continuing operations  $ 1,335   $ 2,654   $ 4,058    ##TABLE_END Other income decreased by $273 million and $237 million in 2009 and 2008. The decreases are primarily driven by a reduction in investment income as a result of lower interest rates and lower investment balances. Interest and debt expense increased by $137 million compared with 2008 due to additional debt issued in 2009. For a discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 5. Backlog Our backlog at December 31 was as follows: ##TABLE_START (dollars in millions)  2009  2008  2007 Contractual backlog:    Commercial Airplanes  $ 250,476  $ 278,575  $ 255,176 Boeing Defense, Space  Security:    Boeing Military Aircraft   26,311   25,710   22,974 Network  Space Systems   7,746   8,868   9,207 Global Services  Support   11,967   10,707   9,607 Total Boeing Defense, Space  Security   46,024   45,285   41,788 Total contractual backlog  $ 296,500  $ 323,860  $ 296,964 Unobligated backlog  $ 19,058  $ 28,066  $ 30,173  ##TABLE_END Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The decrease in contractual backlog during 2009 was due to deliveries in excess of orders, changes in projected revenue escalation and cancellations of orders. The increase in backlog during 2008 was due to orders in excess of deliveries for our 737, 767, 777 and 787 programs. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding have not been authorized. The decrease in unobligated backlog during 2009 is primarily due to decreases at BDS of $8,904 million compared with 2008 partly due to a partial termination for convenience by the U.S. Army of the Brigade Combat Team Modernization (BCTM) (formerly the Future Combat Systems (FCS)) System Development and Demonstration contract relating to Manned Ground Vehicles and associated systems and equipment. Approved funding of existing multi-year contracts including the BCTM, V-22, Chinook, Proprietary and Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) programs also reduced unobligated backlog. The decrease in Unobligated backlog during 2008 is primarily due to decreases at BDS of $2,174 million compared with 2007 primarily due to funding of existing multi-year contracts including the F/A-18, BCTM and F-22 programs. These decreases were partially offset by multi-year procurement contracts awarded on the V-22 and Chinook programs.  Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment 2008 and 2009 were extremely challenging for the worlds airlines as key external business factors (oil prices, economic growth, exchange rates, financing terms) experienced high levels of volatility. In the first half of 2008, airlines focused on adapting to spiking oil prices which peaked close to $150/barrel. In autumn 2008, the airlines focus shifted to the fallout of the global credit crisis and recession as fuel prices fell below $40/barrel for the first time since 2004, and in 2009 passenger and cargo traffic experienced their worst ever declines. This business environment curtailed the airline industry profit recovery that started in 2006. As a result, the global airline industry has now reported losses in seven out of the last ten years, and over 30 airlines have entered bankruptcy since the beginning of 2008. In this challenging environment, airlines are adapting their operations to meet the realities of the markets in which they operate. Airlines reduced global passenger capacity by 2% in 2009 through a combination of frequency and route cuts in unprofitable markets, lower daily airplane utilization (flight hours per day) and parking/scrapping of older generation airplanes. Airlines are also replacing older less fuel efficient airplanes, reducing non-fuel costs and finding new ways to partner through alliances or via mergers and acquisitions. These conditions have caused customers to request cancellations, modifications, or rescheduling of their existing orders and advance payment schedules to meet revised fleet plans or address financing and cash flow issues. Whether such requests will result in a material adverse impact on our earnings, cash flow or financial position depends on a number of factors including whether the request is granted, the type of aircraft, how much compensation is paid to us for costs already incurred and our ability to reschedule other orders to replace those canceled, modified, or rescheduled. Near-term global airline industry indicators are improving although many uncertainties persist. Global economic recovery has begun. Although it is expected to vary significantly by region both in terms of speed and magnitude, world economic growth is forecast to grow moderately in 2010 following contraction in 2009. As a result, airline industry forecasts generally indicate global passenger traffic returning close to 2008 levels in 2010 with many emerging markets posting growth over 2009. Air cargo traffic is forecast to grow above the long-term trend rates in 2010 following two years of contraction which have taken traffic back to 2002 and 2003 levels. Due to these improving demand conditions, airlines are expected to see significantly smaller financial losses globally in 2010. Beyond the near-term market uncertainties, the long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast is for a long-term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger and cargo traffic based on a projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long-term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $3.2 trillion market for 29,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including disease outbreaks (such as avian or H1N1 flus), terrorism and increased global environmental regulations. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We expect the existing long-term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide (measured in real terms) to continue into the foreseeable future. Market liberalization in  Europe and Asia has enabled low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 10% of Commercial Airplanes contractual backlog in dollar terms is with U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are likely to enter the 70 to 190 seat aircraft market over the next few years. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. A decline of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies as experienced in the second half of 2009 puts pressure on competitors revenues and profits. Competitors often respond by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer-term competitive posture. Airbus has announced such initiatives targeting overhead cost savings, a reduction in its development cycle and a significant increase in overall productivity through 2012. If the U.S. dollar strengthens again, Airbus can use the improved efficiency to fund product development, gain market share through pricing and/or improve earnings. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009   2008   2007  Revenues  $ 34,051   $ 28,263   $ 33,386  % of Total company revenues   50 %   46 %   50 % (Loss)/earnings from operations  $ (583 )  $ 1,186   $ 3,584  Operating margins   -1.7 %   4.2 %   10.7 % Research and development  $ 5,383   $ 2,838   $ 2,962  Contractual backlog  $ 250,476   $ 278,575   $ 255,176    ##TABLE_END  Revenues Year-over-year changes in Revenue are shown in the following table: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  2009 vs. 2008   2008 vs. 2007  New airplane sales  $ 6,129   $ (4,876 ) Aircraft trading   (33 )   (264 ) Commercial aviation services business   (308 )   17  Total  $ 5,788   $ (5,123 )   ##TABLE_END The increase in revenue of $5,788 million in 2009 from 2008 is primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries partially offset by lower intercompany revenues. Prior year revenues were negatively impacted by the 2008 IAM strike. The decrease in revenues from commercial aviation services business was driven by economic conditions. The decrease in revenue of $5,123 million in 2008 from 2007 is primarily attributable to lower new airplane deliveries. The IAM strike resulted in 104 airplane deliveries moving out of 2008 which reduced 2008 revenues by $6,406 million. The strike impact was partially offset by higher intercompany revenues of $804 million, and higher pre-strike deliveries, net of model mix changes, of $726 million. Aircraft trading activity decreased by $264 million as a result of fewer sales of used aircraft. Revenues in commercial aviation services business increased by $17 million driven by increased spares and services revenue offset by decreased passenger to freighter conversions. Commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31, were as follows: ##TABLE_START    737   747  767   777  Total 2009      Cumulative Deliveries  3,128   1,418  982   836  Deliveries  372 *  8  13   88  481 2008      Cumulative Deliveries  2,756   1,410  969   748  Deliveries  290 *  14  10 *  61  375 2007      Cumulative Deliveries  2,466   1,396  959   687  Deliveries  330 *  16  12 *  83  441  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START * Intercompany deliveries included five 737 aircraft in 2009, two 767 aircraft and two 737 aircraft in 2008 and one 767 aircraft and one 737 aircraft in 2007. ##TABLE_END Earnings From Operations Earnings from operations for 2009 decreased by $1,769 million when compared to 2008, primarily due to the reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of $2,481 million related to the three 787 flight test aircraft previously recorded as inventory as of July 31, 2009. Additional production costs incurred between August and December 2009 of $212 million related to those flight-test airplanes were also included in research and development expense. Those amounts were partially offset by a $148 million decrease in other research and development expense. The decrease in earnings is also attributable to reach-forward losses on the 747 program which grew by $1,352 million in 2009 compared with losses of $685 million in 2008. The 2009 reach-forward losses were primarily due to increased production costs, reductions in projected delivery price increases associated with escalation and the difficult market conditions affecting the 747-8. Lower commercial aviation services  revenues and margins reduced earnings by $245 million. Higher infrastructure cost allocations related to the 787 and 747-8 schedule delays announced in 2008 and 2009 and infrastructure costs incurred during the 2008 IAM strike reduced earnings by $199 million. Increased period and other costs reduced earnings by $47 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased earnings of $1,934 million related to new airplane deliveries. Earnings from operations decreased by $2,398 million in 2008 when compared to 2007, with operating margins decreasing 6.5 percentage points to 4.2%. Lower new airplane deliveries, partially offset by higher intercompany revenues, reduced earnings by $1,400 million. A charge for a reach-forward loss on the 747 program resulting from increases to estimated costs for development and production of 747-8 derivatives reduced 2008 earnings by $685 million. Infrastructure cost allocations related to the 787 and 747-8 schedule delays and infrastructure costs incurred during the IAM strike reduced earnings by $287 million. The 787 and 747-8 schedule delays resulted in production programs receiving larger allocations of current and future infrastructure costs and reduced margins on 2008 deliveries, while the program infrastructure costs incurred during the IAM strike decreased margins on airplanes delivered during the second half of the year. Increased period and other costs reduced earnings by $108 million. A reduction in commercial aviation services volume and mix-related earnings of $42 million was primarily due to a decrease in volume on passenger to freighter conversion programs. Lower research and development costs improved earnings by $124 million. Backlog Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before Boeing and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their Board of Directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers. The decrease in contractual backlog during 2009 was due to deliveries in excess of orders, changes in projected revenue escalation and cancellations of orders. The increase in backlog during 2008 was due to orders in excess of deliveries for our 737, 767, 777 and 787 programs. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts and is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs of these contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a programs life. Estimation of each programs accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. Commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs, a portion of which does not vary with production rates. As the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity increases, the average cost of the accounting quantity also increases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates. This has the effect of decreasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change.  The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. The table below provides details as of December 31: ##TABLE_START    Program    737  747  767  777  787 2009      Program accounting quantities  4,600  1,499  1,035  1,100  * Undelivered units under firm orders  2,076  108  59  281  851 Cumulative firm orders 2  5,204  1,526  1,041  1,117   2008      Program accounting quantities  4,200  1,499  1,023  1,050  * Undelivered units under firm orders 1  2,270  114  70  350  910 Cumulative firm orders 2  5,026  1,524  1,039  1,098   2007      Program accounting quantities  3,800  1,474  998  950  * Undelivered units under firm orders  2,076  125  52  357  817 Cumulative firm orders 2  4,542  1,521  1,011  1,044   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START *  The accounting quantity for the 787 program will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2010. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1  Undelivered units are not adjusted for cancellations subsequent to December 31, 2008. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 2  Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. ##TABLE_END 737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 400 units during 2009 due to the programs normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. Production rates remained unchanged in 2009. 747 Program There was no change in the accounting quantity for the 747 program during 2009. In 2008, we recorded a charge of $685 million to recognize a reach-forward loss. The charge was primarily related to higher than anticipated costs due to late changes to wing design which drove new load requirements into the fuselage and created other statement of work changes for our suppliers. During 2009, additional charges of $1,352 million were recorded to recognize reach-forward losses. During the first quarter of 2009, we recorded $347 million of a reach-forward loss due to a reduction in projected delivery price increases associated with escalation and an increase in estimated costs due to our decisions to reduce twin-aisle production rates which impact production rates beginning in 2010. During the third quarter of 2009 we increased the reach-forward loss on the 747 program by $1,005 million. Of this amount, $643 million was caused by higher estimated production costs, including both additional internal production costs and higher supplier expenses, attributable to greater than expected re-work and disruption in manufacturing due to late maturity of engineering designs as well as the limited availability of engineering resources. The remaining $362 million was primarily due to challenging cargo market conditions and our related decision to defer a planned increase in the 747-8 production rate, which drove higher allocations of fixed costs and caused us to incur volume-based penalties to suppliers. First flight of the 747-8 Freighter is expected to occur during the first quarter of 2010, with the flight test program expected to take place in 2010. First delivery of the 747-8 Freighter is expected in the fourth  quarter of 2010. First delivery of the Intercontinental passenger variant remains scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2011. The gap between the delivery of the last 747-400, which occurred in 2009, and first deliveries of the 747-8 will result in lower 747 program revenues. 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 12 units during 2009. In April 2009, we announced a delay in previous plans to increase the production rate. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 50 units during 2009. Delivery of the first 777 Freighter occurred in February 2009. In April 2009, we announced that we will lower the production rate on our 777 airplane program, affecting deliveries beginning in June 2010. This lower production rate will decrease revenues and earnings in 2010 and 2011. 787 Program We announced on June 23, 2009 the necessity to reinforce an area of structure at the side-of-body section of the airplane. During the fourth quarter, we completed the modifications on the first two flight-test airplanes and the full-scale static test airplane. First flight of the 787 occurred on December 15, 2009. A second 787 completed its first test flight on December 22, 2009. Six aircraft in total will be involved in the flight test program, which is expected to result in certification of the 787-8 in the fourth quarter of 2010. First delivery is also expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2010. We continue to work toward our planned increases in 787 production rates as well as the timely introduction of the 787-9 derivative. During 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs of $2,481 million previously recorded as program inventory as of July 31, 2009 were reclassified to research and development expense. Additional production costs incurred between August and December 2009 of $212 million related to these flight-test airplanes were also included in research and development expense. We will continue to incur research and development costs on these flight test aircraft in 2010. We believe that the other three additional 787 flight test aircraft are commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to those aircraft in program inventory at December 31, 2009. If we determine that one or more of the other flight test aircraft cannot be sold we may incur additional charges. On July 30, 2009, we acquired the business, assets and operations of Vought Aircraft Industries, Inc.s (Vought) 787 business conducted at North Charleston, South Carolina. The facility produces aft fuselage sections, including the fabrication, assembly and systems installation. See Note 2. On December 22, 2009, we acquired Alenia North Americas 50% ownership interest in Global Aeronautica. As a result of the transaction, we are the sole owner of this entity. Located adjacent to Boeing Charleston, Global Aeronautica is an integrator of the 787 mid-fuselage sections. On October 28, 2009 we announced the North Charleston facility as the location for a second final assembly site for the 787 Dreamliner program. A groundbreaking ceremony was held November 20, 2009 to mark the start of construction. Until the additional 787 assembly line is fully operational, we will establish transitional surge capability at our Everett, Washington, location to facilitate the planned introduction of the 787-9, the first derivative model of the 787 family. When the additional line in North Charleston is fully operational, the surge capability in Everett will be phased out. Looking beyond first flight, we continue to monitor and address other areas of challenge associated with assembly of initial airplanes including management of our extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work as well as weight and systems integration. Efforts continue to ensure we remain focused on satisfying customer mission and performance needs in light of the anticipated weight of their respective aircraft.  We continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes including delivery delays and supplier assertions. A number of our customers have contractual remedies for schedule delays and/or performance. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as brought forth. The cumulative impacts of the flight test delays, production challenges, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts create significant pressure on program revenue and cost estimates. We continue to assess our mitigation plans and cost reduction efforts to address these pressures. Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to aircraft delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the aircraft. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. This level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years. These costs do not vary significantly with current production rates. Research and Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and certification/initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. Our Research and development expense increased by $2,545 million in 2009. This was due to reclassification to research and development expense of $2,693 million of production costs related to the three 787 flight test aircraft and $50 million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments, partially offset by a $198 million decrease of other research and development expense. Our Research and development expense decreased $124 million in 2008. Research and development expense is net of development cost sharing payments received from suppliers. The decrease in research and development spending for 2008 was primarily due to reduced 787 product development activities partially offset by $278 million of increased spending on the 747-8 program and $80 million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments. Additional Considerations The 787 and 747-8 programs highlight the risks that are always inherent in new airplane programs and new derivative airplanes, particularly as both the 747-8 and the 787 begin the demanding flight test and certification phases of program development. Costs related to development of new programs and derivative airplanes are expensed as incurred. Costs to produce new aircraft are included in inventory and accounted for using program accounting. Airplane programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated production costs exceed our estimated program revenues for the accounting quantity. Generally commercial airplanes are sold on a firm fixed-price basis with an indexed price escalation clause and are often sold several years before scheduled delivery. Each customer purchase  agreement contains an escalation clause to account for the effects of economic fluctuations over the period of time from airplane sale to airplane delivery. A price escalation formula based on pre-defined factors is used to determine the final price of the airplane at the time of customer delivery. While firm fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. Many new airplanes and derivatives have highly complex designs, utilize exotic materials and require extensive coordination and integration with supplier partners. As technical or quality issues arise, such as issues experienced on the 787 and 747-8 programs, we may experience schedule delays and higher costs to complete new programs and derivative aircraft. Additionally, price escalation factors may also impact margins by reducing the estimated price of airplanes delivered in the future. There are other factors that could also result in lower margins or a material charge if a program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses. These include: changes to the program accounting quantity, production costs and rates, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs and schedule for derivative airplanes and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Boeing Defense, Space  Security Business Environment and Trends On January 7, 2010, we announced that Integrated Defense Systems will begin operating under the name Boeing Defense, Space  Security (BDS). BDS consists of three capabilities-driven businesses: Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA), Network  Space Systems (NSS) and Global Services  Support (GSS). Additionally, BDS Phantom Works supports all three businesses via product development, rapid prototyping and customer engagement through experimentation and enterprise technology investment strategies. Defense Environment Overview The U.S. continues to balance funding priorities to plan for the broadest possible range of operations that include homeland defense, natural disasters, stabilization efforts, counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations, or nation state aggressors with growing sophistication and military means. The U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) faces the simultaneous requirements to recapitalize important capabilities and transform the force to meet the changing national security as articulated in the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. All of this must be carried out against a backdrop of significant competing national priorities including the economic crisis and healthcare reform. We anticipate that the national security environment will remain dynamic and challenging well into this decade trending with the threat environment. Government policies are impacting the defense environment including defense acquisition reform, more insourcing, concerns over industrial base, a shift in emphasis towards more affordable solutions and emphasis on increasing diplomatic efforts to expand and strengthen our alliances. Although the U.S. DoD budget has grown substantially over the past decade, we expect the total budget growth rate to level off over the next several years due to shifting priorities and budget pressures. The fiscal year 2010 discretionary budget request of $660 billion includes an Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget of $130 billion, with an additional $33 billion requested. The fiscal year 2011 discretionary budget of $708 billion includes OCO budget of $159 billion. Procurement is expected to increase, while Research and Development accounts decrease, facing increasing budgetary pressures due to growing requirements from Operations and Maintenance (OM) and personnel costs tied to U.S. commitments overseas. However, this trend is partially offset by  equipment recapitalization efforts and continued demand for systems development. The near-term forecast of the defense budget environment shows limited growth in the 2011 to 2015 period for investment efforts. Though opportunities may exist following U.S. troop draw-downs in Iraq, they are offset by recent increases in Afghanistan. We continue to see pressure to reduce OCO requests that have been used to cover the ongoing costs of the wars. It is unlikely that the U.S. DoD will be able to fully fund all programs of record already in development as well as new initiatives. This imbalance between future costs of programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the U.S. DoD and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules, restructuring programs, and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding and occasionally by cancellation of programs. We expect the U.S. DoD will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies from acquisition reform and emphasizing utilization of commercial off-the-shelf solutions and network-enabled operations. These strategies will be enabled through persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), long-range strike, special operations, unmanned systems, cyber security, and precision-guided kinetic and non-kinetic weapons, electronic warfare, as well as selected outsourcing of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs. Other nations continue to experience growing demands for new equipment to address operational requirements, aging inventories, and changing threat environments. Greater U.S. reliance on allies and coalition partners places additional pressure on nations to emphasize acquisition of material that is deployable, survivable, and interoperable with the international community. European nations are struggling to meet defense investment needs as budget deficits create greater pressure on resources. Though regional financial concerns exist, Middle Eastern military markets remain robust with stable oil prices and persistent regional security concerns sustaining continued defense investment. In Asia, growth is slowing with nations pursuing select acquisitions to address growing regional threats. The international market will continue to be affected by global economic challenges. However, the continuing threat environment should keep demand stable in 2010. Missile Defense Environment The proliferation of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles is considered the greatest current threat to security and is driving missile defense spending. As a result, the near-term focus for growth is in regional and tactical BMD systems. Civil Space Transportation and Exploration Environment The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) budget is focused on technology development and demonstration programs, the International Space Station, and new initiatives associated with space exploration. NASA is developing new approaches to space exploration with added emphasis on commercial spaceflight systems, space technology development and robotic missions. NASA is also enhancing its focus on climate change and aeronautics research. Homeland Security Environment The continuing threat from terrorism is the key driver for the homeland security market. Key growth areas include aviation security, border security, maritime security and cyber security. Additionally, the U.S. government is focused on increasing cooperation with state and local institutions. Commercial Satellite Environment The commercial satellite market is experiencing improvement in market demand, partly driven by strong U.S. government demand for commercial satellite systems and services, but the overall sector continues to be characterized by overcapacity creating strong competitive pressures on pricing. Adjacent Market Environment We see growth opportunities across a number of adjacent markets with both U.S. DoD and other U.S. government customers. These markets, including services, unmanned systems, intelligence, cyber, and energy, represent key development areas which support the current engagements overseas as well as emerging national security issues.  Services Growth in services is anticipated both domestically and internationally, as customers have a wide variety of needs, including information services, platform-related services, facility management, infrastructure services and logistics command and control. Unmanned Systems The unmanned market continues to see growth in all classes of platforms due to the high demand from the U.S. military in Southwest Asia. We anticipate this growth increasing as unmanned systems continue to provide critical mission functions to the war fighter with affordability, persistence, and accuracy. Intelligence We see the intelligence market growing based on the demands of data collection, dissemination, and analysis driven by the conflicts in Southwest Asia. Growth in data fusion, data management, and information sharing is expected as the use of ISR assets increase. Cyber The demand for defensive, offensive, and exploit operations in the emerging cyber market provides unique growth opportunities as explicit needs are further defined by customers. Cyber threats from both state and non-state actors represent a critical national security issue. The U.S. government is taking significant steps to mitigate the cyber threat to the U.S. DoD and to U.S. critical infrastructure. Energy We anticipate the energy market will emerge with growth potential. As energy volatility becomes more substantial, the need for energy management, infrastructure security, and scenario modeling will increase accordingly. The U.S. DoD, including individual service branches, is also actively engaged in developing energy policy guidance and comprehensive plans from which to execute programs. BDS Realignment Effective January 1, 2009, 2008 and 2007 certain programs were realigned among BDS segments. In addition, effective January 1, 2008, certain environmental remediation contracts (formerly included in NSS) were transferred to the Other Segment. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. See Note 21. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009   2008   2007  Revenues  $ 33,661   $ 32,047   $ 32,052  % of Total company revenues   49 %   53 %   48 % Earnings from operations  $ 3,299   $ 3,232   $ 3,440  Operating margins   9.8 %   10.1 %   10.7 % Research and development  $ 1,101   $ 933   $ 848  Contractual backlog  $ 46,024   $ 45,285   $ 41,788  Unobligated backlog  $ 18,815   $ 27,719   $ 29,893    ##TABLE_END Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues and earnings, may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.  Revenues BDS revenues increased by $1,614 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to higher revenues in GSS and BMA, partially offset by decreases in NSS. BDS revenues were unchanged in 2008 compared to 2007 as revenue growth in GSS was offset by decreases in BMA and NSS. Operating Earnings BDS operating earnings in 2009 increased by $67 million compared with 2008 primarily due to higher earnings in the BMA segment, partially offset by lower earnings in the NSS segment. BDS earnings decreased by $208 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to lower earnings in the BMA segment resulting from a $248 million charge taken on the AEWC program in the second quarter partially offset by higher earnings in the NSS segment. Backlog Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. BDS total backlog decreased 11% in 2009, from $73,004 million to $64,839 million, partly due to a partial termination for convenience from the U.S. Army of the BCTM (formerly FCS) System Development and Demonstration contract relating to Manned Ground Vehicles and associated systems and equipment. Current year deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years also contributed to the backlog reduction. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional Considerations Our business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished. Examples of these programs include Airborne Laser, EA-18G, Family of Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T), BCTM (formerly FCS), GMD, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), P-8A and Proprietary programs. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of these programs include AEWC, International KC-767 Tanker, commercial and military satellites, Vigilare and High Frequency Modernisation.  Boeing Military Aircraft Operating Results (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009   2008   2007  Revenues  $ 14,057   $ 13,311   $ 13,499  % of Total company revenues   20 %   22 %   20 % Earnings from operations  $ 1,513   $ 1,277   $ 1,607  Operating margins   10.8 %   9.6 %   11.9 % Research and development  $ 541   $ 479   $ 445  Contractual backlog  $ 26,311   $ 25,710   $ 22,974  Unobligated backlog  $ 9,322   $ 10,048   $ 8,587    ##TABLE_END Revenues BMA revenues increased 6% in 2009 and decreased 1% in 2008. The increase of $746 million in 2009 was primarily due to higher deliveries and volume on the Apache, V-22 and Chinook rotorcraft programs and the F-18 and Proprietary programs, partly offset by lower volume on the F-22 and several weapons programs. The decrease of $188 million in 2008 is primarily driven by lower F-22, Apache, F-18 and Chinook revenue partially offset by increased deliveries on F-15 and International KC-767 Tanker and C-17 contract mix. Deliveries of new-build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009  2008  2007 F/A-18 Models  49  45  44 F-15E Eagle  13  14  12 C-17 Globemaster  16  16  16 International KC-767 Tanker  2  2  CH-47 Chinook  11  12  10 T-45TS Goshawk  7  7  9 AH-64 Apache  23  3  17 C-40A Clipper      3 Total new-build production aircraft  121  99  111  ##TABLE_END Operating Earnings BMA operating earnings increased by $236 million in 2009 partly due to higher deliveries on several programs and volume, partially offset by a change in delivery mix. Operating earnings in both years were negatively impacted by charges on the AEWC and International KC-767 Tanker programs. BMA earnings decreased by $330 million in 2008 primarily due to charges taken on the AEWC program. Delivery mix and lower volume also contributed to the decrease in 2008. Research and Development The BMA segment continues to focus research and development resources to leverage customer knowledge, technical expertise and system integration of manned and unmanned systems that provide innovative solutions to meet the warfighters enduring needs. Research and development expense in 2009 increased by 13% over 2008 primarily due to proprietary programs which was partially offset by lower international tanker development costs. Research and development activities utilize our capabilities in architectures, system-of-systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to enhance our customers capabilities in the areas of mobility, precision effects, situational awareness and survivability. Investments in prototyping allow us to offer low-risk programs to our customers. The products of our research and development support both new manned and unmanned systems as well as enhanced versions of existing fielded products. Investments support vertical integration of our product line in  areas like autonomous operation of unmanned vehicles, advanced sensors and Electronic Warfare. These efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness, interoperability, reliability and reducing the cost of ownership. Backlog BMA total backlog in 2009 was virtually unchanged from 2008. Backlog increases due to 2009 current year orders for C-17, P-8 India and Chinook aircraft were offset by revenues recognized on multi-year contracts received in prior years with the largest decrease in the F/A-18 program. Total backlog increased by 13% in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to an increase in the V-22, Chinook and F-15 program backlog. These increases were partially offset by deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years with the largest decreases in the C-17 and F/A-18 programs. Additional Considerations Items which could have a future impact on BMA operations include the following: AEWC During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded charges increasing the reach-forward losses on the AEWC programs in Australia and Turkey by $133 million, $308 million and $81 million, respectively. The 2009 charge primarily related to delivery schedule delays. The 2008 charge, primarily related to our program in Australia, was due to subsystem development issues on the electronic warfare and ground support systems and the additional time required for integration testing. The AEWC development program, also known as Wedgetail in Australia, Peace Eagle in Turkey and Peace Eye in the Republic of Korea, consists of 737-700 aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems, some of which have never been installed on an airplane before. Wedgetail includes six aircraft and Peace Eagle and Peace Eye include four aircraft each. During the fourth quarter of 2009, two Wedgetail aircraft were provided to Australia for familiarization and training. Wedgetail final delivery and customer acceptance is scheduled to begin in late 2010 and extend through the second quarter of 2011. These are advanced and complex fixed-price development programs involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability. We believe that the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate; however, the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be delayed. International KC-767 Tanker Program During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded charges increasing the reach-forward losses in the International KC-767 Tanker programs by $78 million, $85 million and $152 million, respectively. The 2007 charge was partially offset at the consolidated level. The International KC-767 Tanker program includes four aircraft for the Italian Air Force and four aircraft for the Japanese Air Self Defense Force. The final delivery to Japan was made in December 2009. The Italian International KC-767 program is ongoing, and while we believe the revenue and cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of the program creates financial risk as additional completion and development costs may be necessary or remaining scheduled delivery dates could be delayed.

Network  Space Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009   2008   2007  Revenues  $ 10,877   $ 11,346   $ 11,481  % of Total company revenues   16 %   19 %   17 % Earnings from operations  $ 839   $ 1,034   $ 863  Operating margins   7.7 %   9.1 %   7.5 % Research and development  $ 397   $ 298   $ 289  Contractual backlog  $ 7,746   $ 8,868   $ 9,207  Unobligated backlog  $ 9,187   $ 16,981   $ 20,134    ##TABLE_END Revenues NSS revenues decreased 4% in 2009 and 1% in 2008. NSS revenues are expected to decrease in 2010, primarily due to lower revenues on the BCTM and GMD programs. The decrease of $469 million in 2009 is primarily due to lower volume on the GMD, Intelligence and Security Systems, and Proprietary programs, partly offset by higher volume on several satellite programs. The decrease of $135 million in 2008 is primarily due to decreased revenues in BCTM (formerly FCS), Proprietary and satellite programs partially offset by increased revenues in the SBInet program. Delta launch and new-build satellite deliveries were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009  2008  2007 Delta II Commercial  1  2  3 Delta IV Commercial  1   Satellites  6  1  4  ##TABLE_END Operating Earnings NSS operating earnings decreased by $195 million in 2009 primarily due to lower revenues and charges related to the Sea Launch bankruptcy. Earnings in 2009 were also reduced by charges related to the settlement of a satellite contract dispute and indemnification of Delta II inventory. Earnings in 2008 included a favorable settlement on a civil satellite program. NSS earnings increased by $171 million in 2008 primarily due to increased earnings from our investment in United Launch Alliance (ULA). NSS operating earnings include equity earnings of $164 million, $178 million and $74 million from the United Space Alliance joint venture and the ULA joint venture in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Research and Development The NSS research and development funding remains focused on the development of communications, command and control, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems (C4ISR); that support a network-enabled architecture approach for our customers. We are investing in capabilities to enhance connectivity between existing and new air/ground and maritime platforms, to increase communications availability, utility and bandwidth through more robust space systems, and to leverage innovative networking and ISR concepts. Key programs in this area include BCTM, JTRS, Wideband Global Satellite System Ares, FAB-T and SBInet. Investments were also made to develop concepts and capabilities related to cyber and security products, as well as the development of next-generation space and intelligence systems. Along with increased funding to support these network-enabled capabilities, we also maintained our investment levels in missile defense, directed energy and advanced exploration systems. Backlog NSS total backlog decreased by 34% in 2009 compared with 2008 partly due to the partial termination for convenience from the U.S. Army of the BCTM (formerly FCS) System Development and Demonstration contract related to Manned Ground Vehicles and associated systems and equipment. Current year deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years including BCTM,  GMD, and Proprietary programs also contributed to the backlog reduction. Total backlog decreased by 12% in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to revenues recognized on multi-year orders received in prior years on BCTM, GMD and C3 programs, partially offset by an increase in the International Space Station program. Additional Considerations Items which could have a future impact on NSS operations include the following: United Launch Alliance On December 1, 2006, we and Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) created a 50/50 joint venture named United Launch Alliance L.L.C. ULA combines the production, engineering, test and launch operations associated with U.S. government launches of Boeing Delta and Lockheed Atlas rockets. We initially contributed net assets of $914 million at December 1, 2006. The book value of our investment exceeded our proportionate share of ULAs net assets. This difference is expensed ratably in future years. Based on the adjusted contributions and the conformed accounting policies established by ULA, this amortization is expected to be approximately $15 million annually for the next 15 years. In connection with the formation of ULA, we and Lockheed each have agreed to extend a line of credit to ULA of up to $200 million to support its working capital requirements during the 5 year period following December 1, 2006. We and Lockheed transferred performance responsibility for certain U.S. government contracts to ULA as of the closing date. We and Lockheed agreed to jointly guarantee the performance of those contracts to the extent required by the U.S. government. We and Lockheed have also each committed to provide ULA with up to $122 million of additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. See Note 7. We agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 million of Boeing Delta inventories included in contributed assets plus $1,860 million of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021. Since inception, ULA has consumed $1,111 million of inventories that were contributed by us and has made payments of $120 million to us under the inventory supply agreement. As part of its integration, ULA is continuing to assess the future of the Delta II program beyond what is currently on contract. In the event ULA is unable to sell additional Delta II inventory, earnings could be reduced by up to $62 million. We agreed to indemnify ULA against potential losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) for four satellite missions. We believe ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing. In December 2008, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value for two of the four satellite missions covered by the indemnification. In March 2009, the USAF issued a denial of that claim and in June 2009, ULA filed an appeal. During 2009, the USAF exercised its option for a third satellite mission. ULA intends to submit a claim to the USAF in 2010 to re-price the contract value of the third mission. If ULA is unsuccessful obtaining additional pricing we may be responsible for some of the shortfall and may record up to $382 million in pre-tax losses associated with the four missions. Business Environment and Trends During 2009, we received a partial termination for convenience from the U.S. Army of the BCTM (formerly FCS) System Development and Demonstration contract relating to Manned Ground Vehicles and associated systems and equipment. We believe the final restructured BCTM contract will negatively impact revenue and earnings in the NSS segment going forward. In addition, we completed the TSAT risk reduction and system definition contract in July 2009 and do not anticipate a future TSAT space segment program competition. As a result of lower than anticipated revenue and earnings, we tested NSS goodwill for impairment during 2009. No  impairment was indicated by our tests. Future recommended budgetary changes, if approved by Congress, or additional partial terminations, could further impact NSS programs, including the recoverability of goodwill. Sea Launch See the discussion of Sea Launch Chapter 11 Filing and outstanding accounts receivable in Note 6 Accounts Receivable.

Global Services  Support Operating Results (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009   2008   2007  Revenues  $ 8,727   $ 7,390   $ 7,072  % of Total company revenues   13 %   12 %   11 % Earnings from operations  $ 947   $ 921   $ 970  Operating margins   10.9 %   12.5 %   13.7 % Research and development  $ 163   $ 156   $ 114  Contractual backlog  $ 11,967   $ 10,707   $ 9,607  Unobligated backlog  $ 306   $ 690   $ 1,172    ##TABLE_END Revenues GSS revenues increased $1,337 million in 2009 and $318 million in 2008, an increase of 18% and 4%. The 2009 increase was due to increased volume in the Integrated Logistics (IL), and the Training Systems and Services (TSS) divisions. The 2008 increase was due to higher revenues in the TSS and IL divisions partially offset by decreases in International Support program volume. Operating Earnings GSS Operating earnings increased 3% in 2009 as additional earnings from increased volume were partially offset by lower margins due to contract adjustments and changes in contract mix. Operating earnings decreased by 5% in 2008 due to changes in the contract mix and disposition of contract matters. Research and Development GSS continues to focus investment strategies on its core businesses including IL, Maintenance Modifications and Upgrades (MMU) and TSS, as well as on moving into new market areas of Logistics Command and Control (Log C2) and Energy Management in Advanced Global Services and Support. Investments have been made to continue the development and implementation of innovative tools, processes and systems as market discriminators in the delivery of integrated customer solutions. Examples of successful programs stemming from these investment strategies include the C-17 Globemaster Sustainment Partnership, the F/A-18 Integrated Readiness Support Teaming program, the F-15 Singapore Performance-Based Logistics contract, and Smart Grid Projects. Successful development of adaptable systems has allowed GSS to transition from Boeing platforms and into the broader aviation market. Beyond aerospace, GSS capabilities have created opportunities in adjacencies and new markets exemplified in 2009 through entrance into the Land Vehicle support, Energy Solutions, and Logistics Information Systems markets. Backlog GSS total backlog increased by 8% in 2009 compared with 2008 due to significant growth in International Support and Defense and Government Services programs and partially offset by decreases in the IL and MMU divisions. Total backlog increased 6% in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to increases in IL and International Support programs.  Boeing Capital Corporation Business Environment and Trends BCCs customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 totaled $5,666 million, which was substantially collateralized by Boeing produced commercial aircraft. A substantial portion of BCCs portfolio is concentrated among U.S. commercial airline customers. The weak global economic environment and capital market disruptions affected the availability of credit for the airline industry. While sources of financing available for aircraft deliveries improved during 2009, BCC provided limited financing to certain Boeing customers. To the extent capital market conditions continue to improve, we believe the overall aircraft financing market should improve as well and lessen the need for BCC to provide financing. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,400 western-built commercial jet aircraft (11.6% of current world fleet) were parked as of December 2009, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Over 36% of the parked aircraft are not expected to return to service. In December 2008 and 2007, 11.0% and 8.2% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. Summary Financial Information (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009   2008   2007  Revenues  $ 660   $ 703   $ 815  Earnings from operations  $ 126   $ 162   $ 234  Operating margins   19 %    23 %   29 %   ##TABLE_END Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease and interest from financing receivables and notes. BCCs revenues decreased $43 million in 2009, resulting from lower operating lease income resulting from a smaller portfolio of equipment under operating leases as a result of aircraft returns and asset dispositions. BCCs revenues decreased $112 million in 2008, primarily due to lower interest income on notes receivable and lower investment income. Earnings From Operations BCCs operating earnings are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Operating earnings decreased by $36 million in 2009 primarily due to lower revenues, higher impairment expense and a provision for losses primarily due to declines in aircraft collateral values and reduced projected cash flows for certain aircraft. The decrease in operating earnings in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to lower revenues.  Financial Position The following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31,: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  2009   2008  BCC Customer Financing and Investment Portfolio  $ 5,666   $ 6,023  Valuation Allowance as a % of Total Receivables   2.5 %    2.1 % Debt  $ 4,075   $ 3,652  Debt-to-Equity Ratio   5.8-to-1    5.0-to-1    ##TABLE_END BCCs customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 decreased from December 31, 2008 due to normal portfolio run-off partially offset by new business volume. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, BCC had $385 million and $685 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease, of which $345 million and $305 million had either executed term sheets with deposits or firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease. In March 2009, Mexicana Group committed to lease 25 717 aircraft, including 13 that were placed on lease and 12 that were held for sale or re-lease at December 31, 2009. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $171 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2010. These aircraft are being remarketed or the leases are being extended and approximately $15 million of such aircraft had either executed term sheets with deposits or firm contracts at December 31, 2009. BCC enters into certain transactions with the Other segment in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies. Restructurings and Restructuring Requests From time to time, certain customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with BCC. As of December 31, 2009, BCC has not reached agreement on any restructuring requests that would have a material adverse effect on its earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. Other Segment (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009   2008   2007  Revenues  $ 165   $ 567   $ 308  Loss from operations  $ (152 )  $ (307 )  $ (331 )   ##TABLE_END Effective January 1, 2008, certain intercompany items were realigned between the Other segment and Unallocated expense. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. Other segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $402 million compared with 2008 primarily due to the sale of three C-17 aircraft in 2008 held under operating lease. Other segment operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $155 million primarily due to recognition of pre-tax expense of $82 million in the prior year to increase the allowance for losses on customer financing receivables related to lower U.S. airline customer credit ratings. During 2009, Other segment recognized $76 million in lower charges relating to environmental remediation than in 2008. Other segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by $259 million compared with 2007 primarily due to the sale of four C-17 aircraft held under operating lease, three of which were sold in 2008. Other segment operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased by $24 million compared with 2007 primarily due to $50 million in lower environmental and certain other charges offset by the recognition of a provision for losses of $82 million related to lower U.S. airline customer credit ratings. The provision for losses amount has been recorded in the Other segment as a result of intercompany guarantees we provide to BCC.  Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Summary ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)    Years ended December 31,  2009   2008   2007  Net earnings  $ 1,312   $ 2,672   $ 4,074  Non-cash items   2,381    1,829    1,753  Changes in working capital   1,910    (4,902 )   3,757  Net cash provided/(used) by operating activities   5,603    (401 )   9,584  Net cash (used)/provided by investing activities   (3,794 )    1,888    (3,822 ) Net cash provided/(used) by financing activities   4,094    (5,202 )   (4,884 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents   44    (59 )   46  Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents   5,947    (3,774 )   924  Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year   3,268    7,042    6,118  Cash and cash equivalents at end of year  $ 9,215   $ 3,268   $ 7,042    ##TABLE_END Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $6,004 million to $5,603 million during 2009 compared with 2008. The improvement reflects a reduction in working capital due to the inventory that was built up during the 2008 IAM strike which was delivered in 2009, offset by the continued ramp up of the 787 program during 2009. We expect operating cash flows to be lower in 2010 as we continue to build inventories prior to deliveries of the 787 and 747-8 airplanes. We contributed 29,211,295 shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $1.5 billion to our pension plans in November 2009. Cash contributions to our pension plans totaled $82 million and $531 million in 2009 and 2008. Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities totaled $3,794 million during 2009 compared with $1,888 million provided during 2008. The $5,682 million year-over-year change is primarily due to changes in investments in time deposits and debt securities. In 2008 we received net proceeds of $4,670 million from liquidating investments. In 2009, we made net contributions of $1,588 million to investments. In 2009, other investing outlays included $639 million for acquisitions and $448 million to satisfy guarantees of Sea Launch indebtedness, which was partially offset by a $40 million reimbursement. These cash outlays were partly offset by $488 million of lower capital spending on property, plant and equipment additions in 2009 compared with 2008. We expect capital spending in 2010 to be higher than 2009 due to the construction of a second 787 final assembly line in North Charleston, South Carolina. Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities totaled $4,094 million during 2009 compared with $5,202 million used during 2008, primarily due to proceeds from borrowings of $5,961 million in 2009 and reductions in share repurchases in 2009. On March 13, 2009, we issued notes totaling $1,850 million, on July 28, 2009, we issued notes totaling $1,950 million, and on November 20, 2009, we issued notes totaling $1,200 million. On October 27, 2009, BCC issued notes totaling $1,000 million. In 2009, we repaid $551 million of debt, including $528 million of debt held at BCC. In 2008, we repaid $738 million of debt, including $709 million of debt held at BCC. In 2007, we repaid $1,406 million of debt, including $1,309 million of debt held at BCC. There were no material debt issuances during 2008 or 2007. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the recorded balance of debt was $12,924 million and $7,512 million, of which $707 million and $560 million were classified as short-term. This includes $4,075 million and $3,652 million of debt recorded at BCC, of which $659 million and $528 million was classified as short-term.  During 2009, we repurchased 1,173,152 shares at an average price of $42.94 in our open market share repurchase program and 477,176 shares transferred to us from employees in satisfaction of minimum tax withholding obligations associated with the vesting of restricted stock during the period. During 2008, we repurchased 42,073,885 shares at an average price of $69.79 in our open market share repurchase program, 1,462,776 shares at an average price of $64.95 as part of the ShareValue Trust distribution, and 74,824 shares in stock swaps. During 2007, we repurchased 28,995,599 shares at an average price of $95.68 in our open market share repurchase program and 28,432 shares in stock swaps. Share repurchase activity is expected to remain at a minimal level in 2010. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings are summarized below: ##TABLE_START    Fitch  Moodys  Standard  Poors Long-term:    Boeing/BCC  A+  A2  A Outlook  Negative  Negative  Stable Short-term:    Boeing/BCC  F1  P-1  A-1  ##TABLE_END On April 30, 2009, Fitch Ratings affirmed Boeings and BCCs A+ credit rating but changed its outlook from stable to negative. On July 29, 2009, Standard  Poors lowered Boeings and BCCs long-term ratings from A+ to A. On October 14, 2009, Moodys affirmed Boeings and BCCs A2 and P-1 ratings, but changed its outlook from neutral to negative. Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants. We and BCC have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2009 and at December 31, 2009, neither we nor BCC had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $3,525 million ($1,500 million exclusively available for BCC) of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements, of which $2,000 million is a 5-year credit facility expiring in November 2012 and $1,525 million is a 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in November 2010. Both the 5-year and 364-day credit facilities have a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration dates. In 2009, we renewed the 364-day revolving credit facility, of which $500 million is allocated to BCC. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support possible commercial paper borrowings in 2010. On March 9, 2009, we filed a public shelf registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities and common stock. In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. At this point in time, our access to liquidity sources has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment, and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities will not be materially impacted by capital market conditions. On November 9, 2009, we made pension contributions in the form of 29,211,295 shares of our common stock. The contributed shares had an aggregate value of $1.5 billion, as of the contribution  date. The share contribution did not affect cash balances. In addition, we made cash contributions of $82 million during 2009. In 2010, we will begin matching employee contributions to the company-sponsored 401(k) plan with common stock instead of cash for nonunion employees. At December 31, 2009 and 2008 our pension plans were $6,356 million and $8,420 million underfunded as measured under GAAP. In 2010, required contributions to our pension plans are not expected to exceed $100 million. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2009, and the estimated timing thereof. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Total  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  3-5 years  After 5 years Long-term debt (including current portion)  $ 12,846  $ 680  $ 2,815  $ 2,547  $ 6,804 Interest on debt*   7,981   664   1,204   934   5,179 Pension and other postretirement cash requirements   22,038   634   1,484   5,304   14,616 Capital lease obligations   76   14   28   22   12 Operating lease obligations   1,158   213   300   188   457 Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position   100,496   35,387   29,070   20,821   15,218 Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position   11,793   10,893   765   131   4 Total contractual obligations  $ 156,388  $ 48,485  $ 35,666  $ 29,947  $ 42,290  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START * Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2009. Variable rate debt was approximately 1% of our total debt at December 31, 2009. ##TABLE_END Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. In addition, the agreements are not cancelable without substantial penalty. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Approximately 9% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts. Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position include agreements for production goods, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts,  property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation and dividends payable. Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2009, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2009, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $11 billion that extend through 2024. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Income Tax Obligations As of December 31, 2009, our total liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions, was $1,009 million, of which $182 million we expect to pay in the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining $827 million. Our income tax obligations are excluded from the table above. See Note 5. Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2009. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Total Amounts Committed/Maximum Amount of Loss  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  4-5 years  After 5 years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds  $ 7,052  $ 5,944  $ 770  $ 3  $ 335 Commercial aircraft financing commitments   10,409   1,873   1,313   2,753   4,470 Total commercial commitments  $ 17,461  $ 7,817  $ 2,083  $ 2,756  $ 4,805  ##TABLE_END  Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we currently do not anticipate that all of these commitments will be exercised by our customers; however there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 11. Contingent Obligations We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 20, including our contesting the default termination of the A-12 aircraft, litigation/arbitration involving BSSI programs and employment and benefits litigation brought by several of our employees. Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $706 million at December 31, 2009. For additional information, see Note 11. Income Taxes We have recorded a net liability of $1,787 million at December 31, 2009 for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of these contingencies, see Note 5. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government. Generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. The development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. Estimates of each significant contracts sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made.  Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS for all of 2009 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $337 million. A number of our contracts are in a reachforward loss position. Changes to estimated loss in future periods are recorded immediately in earnings. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling costs, and routine warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates, consistent with typical sales contract terms. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower margins than established programs. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs, excluding the 747 program, for all of 2009 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $275 million. The 747 program is in a reach-forward loss position. Absent changes in the estimated revenues or costs, subsequent deliveries are  recorded at zero margin. Reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately. Aircraft Valuation Allowance for Losses on Customer Financing Receivables The allowance for losses on customer financing receivables (valuation provision) is used to provide for potential impairment of customer financing receivables in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the customer financing receivables portfolio. The estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including historical loss experience, collateral values, and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings, collateral values and default rates. If each customers credit rating were upgraded or downgraded by one major rating category at December 31, 2009, the allowance would have decreased by $142 million or increased by $308 million. If the collateral values were 10% higher or lower at December 31, 2009, the allowance would have decreased by $56 million or increased by $54 million. If the cumulative default rates used for each rating category should increase or decrease 1%, the allowance would have increased by $6 million or decreased by $6 million. Impairment Review for Assets Under Operating Leases and Held for Re-Lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than its carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Had future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been 10% lower, we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Lease Residual Values Equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease. Estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease. If the estimated residual values declined 10% at December 31, 2009, this would result in a future cumulative pre-tax earnings impact of approximately $180 million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods, of which approximately $45 million would be recognized in 2010. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. April 1 is our annual testing date. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the  amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any. Changes in our forecasts or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. A 10% decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our operations would have no impact on the carrying value of goodwill. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had $499 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would have no impact on the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets. Postretirement Plans Substantially all our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans. We also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets. These measurements require several assumptions. Significant assumptions include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend rate (rate of growth for medical costs). Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligations and Shareholders equity. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2009. ##TABLE_START (dollars in millions)  Change in discount rate Increase 25 bps   Change in discount rate Decrease 25 bps Pension plans   Projected benefit obligation  $ (1,478 )  $ 1,817 Net periodic pension cost   (166 )   189 Other postretirement benefit plans   Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation   (163 )   192 Net periodic postretirement benefit cost   (12 )   14  ##TABLE_END  Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2009 net periodic pension expense by $117 million. Differences between actual and expected returns can affect future years pension cost. The asset balance used to calculate the expected return on pension plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes changes in the fair value of assets over a five year period. Despite investment gains during 2009, the significant losses incurred during 2008 will cause net periodic pension cost for 2010 to increase by approximately $100 million due to amortization of actuarial losses. Absent a recovery of asset values or higher interest rates or higher contributions, net periodic pension expense will increase further in future years. The assumed medical trend rates have a significant effect on the following years expense, recorded liabilities and Shareholders Equity. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 100 basis point change as of December 31, 2009. ##TABLE_START (dollars in millions)  Change in medical trend rate Increase 100 bps  Change in medical trend rate Decrease 100 bps  Other postretirement benefit plans   Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation  $ 617  $ (541 ) Net periodic postretirement benefit cost   119   (104 )   ##TABLE_END  ", "7A": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Exposure to this risk is managed by generally matching the profile of BCCs liabilities with that of BCCs assets in relation to amount and terms such as expected maturities and fixed versus floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2009, the impact to BCCs pre-tax earnings of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained rise in interest rates would be insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2010. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our investments or customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. Based on the portfolio of other Boeing fixed-rate debt, the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material. The investors in the fixed-rate debt obligations that we issue do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2009, a 10% increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized gains by $136 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our unrealized gains by $150 million. At December 31, 2008, a 10% increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency forward and option contracts would have decreased our unrealized losses by $70 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would have decreased our unrealized losses by $196 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.  ", "8": " Item 8.

The Boeing Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, 2007 (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as Boeing, the Company, we, us, or our). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted a newly issued accounting standard which was retrospectively applied and requires the noncontrolling interest to be separately presented as a component of shareholders equity on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and Shareholders Equity. The impact of this standard was not material to the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Use of Estimates Management makes assumptions and estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Those assumptions and estimates directly affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant estimates for which changes in the near term are considered reasonably possible and that may have a material impact on the financial statements are disclosed in these notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Cycle For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year and could exceed 3 years. Revenue and Related Cost Recognition Contract Accounting Contract accounting is used for development and production activities predominantly by Boeing Defense, Space  Security (BDS) (formerly IDS). The majority of business conducted by BDS is performed under contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that extend over several years. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract resulting in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. We combine contracts for accounting purposes when they are negotiated as a package with an overall profit margin objective, essentially represent an agreement to do a single project for a single customer, involve interrelated construction activities with substantial common costs, and are performed concurrently or sequentially. When a group of contracts is combined, revenue and profit are earned uniformly over the performance of the combined contracts. Sales related to fixed-price contracts are recognized as deliveries are made, except for certain fixed-price contracts that require substantial performance over an extended period before deliveries begin, for which sales are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones. Sales related to contracts in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as  costs are incurred. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if specified targets are achieved. Incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated and are probable are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded. Program Accounting Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales related to its programs. Program accounting is applicable to products manufactured for delivery under production-type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contracts and years. Under program accounting, inventoriable production costs, program tooling costs, and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced, and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling, and routine warranty costs for the total program. We recognize sales for commercial airplane deliveries as each unit is completed and accepted by the customer. Sales recognized represent the price negotiated with the customer, adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. The amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Concession Sharing Arrangements We account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their purchase of products and services as a reduction to revenue when the related products and services are delivered. The sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendors products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products. Spare Parts Revenue We recognize sales of spare parts upon delivery and the amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost. Service Revenue Service revenue is recognized when the service is performed with the exception of U.S. government service agreements, which are accounted for using contract accounting. Service activities primarily include: support agreements associated with military aircraft and helicopter contracts, ongoing maintenance of International Space Station and Space Shuttle, commercial Delta launches and technical and flight operation services for commercial aircraft. Service revenue and associated cost of sales from pay-in-advance subscription fees are deferred and recognized as services are rendered. Financial Services Revenue We record financial services revenue associated with sales-type finance leases, operating leases, and notes receivable. Lease and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type finance leases, we record an asset at lease inception. This asset is recorded at the aggregate future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. Residual values,  which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized as Cost of services in the period in which the declines occur. For operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets, included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated residual value, using the straight-line method. Prepayments received on operating lease contracts are classified as Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. We periodically review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense. For notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note. Reinsurance Revenue Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Astro Ltd., participates in a reinsurance pool for workers compensation. The member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $122, $83 and $84 during 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were $118, $86, and $93 during 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively. Revenues and costs are presented net in Cost of services in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fleet Support We provide assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation to the operators of all our commercial airplane models. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, and technical consulting support. This activity continues throughout the aircrafts operational life. Services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire models fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services. Research and Development Research and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design, testing, and bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services and are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements. Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with our contract accounting policy. We have certain research and development arrangements that meet the requirement for best efforts research and development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expense rather than as contract revenues. We have established cost sharing arrangements with some suppliers for the 787 program, which have enhanced our internal development capabilities and have offset a substantial portion of the financial  risk of developing this aircraft. Our cost sharing arrangements state that the supplier contributions are for reimbursements of costs we incur for experimentation, basic design, and testing activities during the 787 development. In each arrangement, we retain substantial rights to the 787 part or component covered by the arrangement. The amounts received from these cost sharing arrangements are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses since we have no obligation to refund any amounts received per the arrangements regardless of the outcome of the development efforts. Specifically, under the terms of each agreement, payments received from suppliers for their share of the costs are typically based on milestones and are recognized as earned when we achieve the milestone events and no ongoing obligation on our part exists. In the event we receive a milestone payment prior to the completion of the milestone, the amount is classified in Other accrued liabilities until earned. Share-Based Compensation We provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value net of estimated forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. Income Taxes Provisions for federal, state, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Earnings before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. Tax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of Income tax expense. Postretirement Plans We sponsor various pension plans covering substantially all employees. We also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employees annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). A portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and reflected in inventory at the end of a reporting period. If gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities we amortize them over the average future  service period of employees. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Effective December 31, 2008, accounting standards required us to measure our plan assets and benefit obligations at December 31, the date of our year end. We previously performed this measurement at September 30 of each year. Postemployment Plans We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated. Environmental Remediation We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations, and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties who have and have not agreed to a settlement and of recoveries from insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites based on our best estimate within a range of potential exposure for investigation, cleanup, and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be able to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third-parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits, and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank, and reclassify any negative balances to Accounts payable. Accounts payable included $211 and $157 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, attributable to checks written but not yet cleared by the bank. Inventories Inventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe benefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries and plant services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costs include amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one year. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative commercial airplane program, the actual costs incurred for production of the early units in the program may exceed the amount reported as cost of sales for those units. In addition, the use of a total program gross profit rate to delivered units may result in costs assigned to delivered units in a reporting period being less than the actual cost of those units. The excess actual costs incurred over the amount reported as cost of sales is disclosed as deferred production costs, which are included in inventory along with unamortized tooling costs.  The determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that determine an estimate of costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision is recorded. The determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that determine an estimate of revenue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity. When estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. Used aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value. See Aircraft valuation within this Note for our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or market. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired inventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs. Included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs. In the unlikely situation that an airline customer was not able to perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the ability to recover amounts paid through retaining amounts secured by advances received on aircraft to be delivered. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be recoverable, it would be recognized as a current period expense. We net advances and progress billings on long-term contracts against inventory in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Advances and progress billings in excess of related inventory are reported in Advances and billings in excess of related costs. Precontract Costs We may, from time to time, incur costs to begin fulfilling the statement of work under a specific anticipated contract that we are still negotiating with a customer. If we determine it is probable that we will be awarded the specific anticipated contract, then we capitalize the precontract costs we incur, excluding any start-up costs which are expensed as incurred. Capitalized precontract costs of $183 and $350 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, are included in Inventories, net of advances and progress billings, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and equipment, from 3 to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over five years. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition. Long-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Long-lived assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in  circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Asset Retirement Obligations We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material. We also have known conditional asset retirement obligations, such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liabilitys fair value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology, from 3 to 14 years; product know-how, from 3 to 30 years; customer base, from 1 to 19 years; distribution rights, from 9 to 30 years; and other, from 1 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Investments We classify investment securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities include time deposits and are carried at cost.  Available-for-sale securities include marketable debt and equity securities and Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates and are recorded at their fair values, with unrealized gains and losses reported as part of Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Realized gains and losses on marketable securities are recognized based on the cost of securities using the first-in, first-out method. Realized gains and losses on all other available-for-sale securities are recognized based on specific identification. Available-for-sale securities are assessed for impairment quarterly. To determine if an impairment is other-than-temporary, we consider the duration and severity of the loss position, the strength of the underlying collateral, the term to maturity, credit rating and our intent to sell. For debt securities that are deemed other-than-temporarily impaired and there is no intent to sell, impairments are separated into the amount related to the credit loss, which is recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the amount related to all other factors, which is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. For debt securities that are deemed other-than-temporarily impaired and there is an intent to sell, impairments in their entirety are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For equity securities that are deemed other-than-temporarily impaired, impairments in their entirety are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Payments received on other-than-temporarily impaired investments are recorded using the cost recovery method. The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between 20% and 50%. We classify investment income and loss on our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on whether the investment is operating or non-operating in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, including our share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from certain cost method investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic purposes. Earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on marketable securities, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in Other (expense)/income, net. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them. We use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes in fair value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is to include in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For our cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported in Shareholders equity (as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss of a cash flow hedge is reported in earnings immediately. We also hold certain instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For these derivative instruments, the changes in their fair value are also recorded in earnings immediately.  Aircraft Valuation Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into specified-price trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally ten years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that no contingent repurchase agreements have become trade-in commitments. All trade-in commitments at December 31, 2009 and 2008 are solely attributable to Sale Aircraft and did not originate from contingent repurchase agreements. Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of: ##TABLE_START  (1)  Adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recorded in Inventory and recognized upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  (2)  Charges to cost of products for adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in Other accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_END The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customers requirements; or the scrap market. Trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market. This quarterly valuation process yields results that are typically lower than residual value estimates by independent sources and tends to more accurately reflect results upon the actual placement of the aircraft. Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or market as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer financing; however, the valuation continues to be based on the lower of cost or market. The lower of cost or market assessment is performed quarterly using the process described above. Asset valuation for assets under operating lease, assets held for sale or re-lease and collateral underlying receivables Customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivables, and sales-type/financing leases. Sales-type/financing leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary. We assess the fair value of the assets we own, including equipment under operating leases, assets held for sale or re-lease, and collateral underlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are less  than the related assets carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fair values of finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables. We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications. Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including our intentions for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. We state assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Allowance for losses on customer financing receivables We record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in our portfolio in a valuation account, the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivables portfolio. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to two components of receivables: (a) specifically identified receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables. We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the receivable agreement, without regard to any subsequent restructurings. Factors considered in assessing collectibility include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. We determine a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral. We review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables (after excluding receivables subject to a specific impairment allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Credit ratings are determined for each customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, for example, permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall.  Each quarter we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables. Warranties In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material and design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a three to four-year standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards under our authorization. These warranties are included in the programs estimate at completion. Additionally, on occasion we have made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model. These costs are expensed as incurred. Warranties issued by our BDS segments principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons hardware and are included in the contract cost estimates. These sales are generally accompanied by a six to twelve-month warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate. Supplier Penalties We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully anticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts. Guarantees We record a liability in Other accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. For a residual value guarantee where we received a cash premium, the liability is equal to the cash premium received at the guarantees inception. For credit and performance guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditors default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable, for each future period the credit or performance guarantee will be outstanding. If at inception of a guarantee, we determine there is a probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value of the guarantee as described above or (b) the probable contingent loss amount. Note 2  Acquisitions Vought Aircraft Industries Inc. On July 30, 2009, we acquired the business, assets and operations of Vought Aircraft Industries, Inc.s (Vought) 787 business conducted at North Charleston, South Carolina. In connection with the acquisition, we paid cash consideration of $590 and released Vought from its obligation to repay amounts of $416 previously advanced by us. Voughts 787 business produces aft fuselage sections,  including the fabrication, assembly and systems installation, for the 787 program. The acquisition of Vought is intended to strengthen our 787 program and bolster our capability to develop and produce large composite structures. The results of operations from the acquisition date are included in our Commercial Airplanes segment. The final allocation of the purchase price is as follows: ##TABLE_START Net inventory  $ 241  Property, plant and equipment   170  Goodwill   606  Finite-lived intangible assets 1   49  Accounts payable   (24 ) Other accrued liabilities   (31 ) Other long-term liabilities   (5 ) Total net assets acquired  $ 1,006    ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1  The weighted average amortization period for finite-lived intangible assets is 17 years. ##TABLE_END Other Acquisitions As part of an acquisition made in 2008, we may be required to pay up to an additional $48 of purchase price for contingent consideration. The additional consideration is due in the event specified targets are achieved over a three year period and will be recorded if the targets are met. Note 3  Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Commercial Airplanes   Boeing Military Aircraft  Network  Space Systems  Global Services  Support   Total  Balance at January 1, 2007 1  $ 1,365   $ 593  $ 883  $ 206   $ 3,047  Goodwill adjustments   (25 )     (1 )   (26 ) Acquisition   60              60  Balance at December 31, 2007  $ 1,400   $ 593  $ 883  $ 205   $ 3,081  Goodwill adjustments   (35 )      (35 ) Acquisitions 2   84    248   201   68    601  Balance at December 31, 2008  $ 1,449   $ 841  $ 1,084  $ 273   $ 3,647  Vought acquisition   606       606  Other   28       18   20    66  Balance at December 31, 2009  $ 2,083   $ 841  $ 1,102  $ 293   $ 4,319    ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1  Effective January 1, 2009, 2008 and 2007, certain programs were realigned among BDS segments. Prior year amounts have been recast for segment realignments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 2  The increase in goodwill is primarily the result of nine acquisitions during 2008. The purchase price allocations for five acquisitions were finalized during 2008. The purchase price allocations for the remaining four acquisitions were finalized in the first and second quarters of 2009. ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had indefinite-lived intangible assets with carrying amounts of $499 relating to tradenames.  The gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization of our acquired finite-lived intangible assets were as follows at December 31: ##TABLE_START   2009  2008    Gross Carrying Amount  Accumulated Amortization  Gross Carrying Amount  Accumulated Amortization Distribution rights  $ 1,596  $ 140  $ 1,265  $ 82 Developed technology   831   581   851   494 Customer base   517   165   397   107 Product know-how   333   98   325   85 Other   198   113   230   114 Total  $ 3,475  $ 1,097  $ 3,068  $ 882  ##TABLE_END Amortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $207 and $166. Estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding years is as follows: 2010  $239; 2011  $196; 2012  $191; 2013  $167 and 2014  $157. Non-cash investing and financing transactions related to acquired finite-lived intangibles during 2009 and 2008 were $329 and $235. Total acquired finite-lived intangibles of $604 and $275 remain unpaid as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Note 4  Earnings Per Share The weighted-average number of shares outstanding used to compute earnings per share are as follows: ##TABLE_START (Shares in millions) Years ended December 31,  2009  2008  2007 Weighted average shares outstanding  705.9  719.9  750.5 Participating securities  3.7  2.9  9.0 Basic weighted average shares outstanding  709.6  722.8  759.5 Dilutive potential common shares  3.8  6.2  13.0 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding  713.4  729.0  772.5  ##TABLE_END Basic earnings per share is calculated by the sum of (1) net earnings less declared dividends and dividend equivalents related to share-based compensation divided by the basic weighted average shares outstanding and (2) declared dividends and dividend equivalents related to share-based compensation divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding, included in the table below, is excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the average market price did not exceed the exercise/threshold price. However, these shares may be dilutive potential common shares in the future. ##TABLE_START (Shares in millions) Years ended December 31,  2009  2008  2007 Stock options  16.8  14.9  ShareValue Trust  13.2  12.7  25.8 Performance Awards  2.0  2.0  3.0 Performance Shares  0.8  0.7  0.7 Stock units  0.2  0.3   ##TABLE_END  Note 5  Income Taxes The components of earnings before income taxes were: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009  2008  2007 U.S.  $ 1,638  $ 3,794  $ 5,901 Non-U.S.   93   201   217  $ 1,731  $ 3,995  $ 6,118  ##TABLE_END Income tax expense/(benefit) consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009   2008  2007  Current tax expense    U.S. federal  $ (132 )  $ 44  $ 1,260  Non-U.S.   69    29   139  U.S. state   145    20   164     82    93   1,563  Deferred tax expense    U.S. federal   457    1,151   487  Non-U.S.   (55 )   26   (6 ) U.S. state   (88 )   71   16     314    1,248   497  Total income tax expense  $ 396   $ 1,341  $ 2,060    ##TABLE_END Net income tax payments/(refunds) were ($198), $599 and $711 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our effective income tax rate was 22.9%, 33.6%, and 33.7% for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower in 2009 primarily because tax credits such as Research and Development credits represented a higher proportion of earnings before taxes due to the year-over-year reduction in earnings. The following is a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% to our effective income tax rate: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009   2008   2007  U.S. federal statutory tax  35.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % Research and Development credits  (10.1 )  (4.3 )  (2.4 ) Tax on international activities  (2.4 )  (0.7 )  1.0  Tax deductible dividends  (2.2 )  (0.8 )  (0.4 ) State income tax provision, net of effect on U.S. federal tax  2.2   1.7   1.6  Other provision adjustments  0.4   2.7   (1.1 ) Effective income tax rate  22.9 %  33.6 %  33.7 %   ##TABLE_END  Significant components of our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2009   2008  Retiree health care accruals  $ 2,930   $ 2,970  Inventory and long-term contract methods of income recognition and other (net of valuation allowance of $23 and $17)   (994 )   (604 ) Partnerships and joint ventures   (528 )   (500 ) Other employee benefits accruals   1,411    1,367  In-process research and development related to acquisitions   79    93  Net operating loss, credit, and charitable contribution carryovers (net of valuation allowance of $36 and $31)   477    270  Pension asset (liability)   2,345    3,026  Customer and commercial financing   (1,703 )   (1,604 ) Unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries   (55 )   (55 ) Other net unrealized losses (gains)   66    197  Net deferred tax assets 1  $ 4,028   $ 5,160    ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1  Of the deferred tax asset for net operating loss and credit carryovers, $184 expires in years ending from December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2029 and $293 may be carried over indefinitely. ##TABLE_END Net deferred tax assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2009   2008  Deferred tax assets  $ 13,739   $ 14,700  Deferred tax liabilities   (9,652 )   (9,492 ) Valuation allowance   (59 )   (48 ) Net deferred tax assets  $ 4,028   $ 5,160    ##TABLE_END The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Included in the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008 are deferred tax assets in the amounts of $7,226 and $8,134 related to other comprehensive income. We have provided for U.S. deferred income taxes and foreign withholding tax in the amount of $55 on undistributed earnings not considered permanently reinvested in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding tax on the remainder of undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested and it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that may be payable upon distribution. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the amount of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position was as follows: interest of $271 and $215, and penalties of $14 and $14. The amount of interest accrued during 2009 was $45. The years 2004-2006 are currently being examined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and we have filed appeals with the IRS for 1998-2003. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2001-2009 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: ##TABLE_START    2009   2008  Unrecognized Tax Benefits  January 1,  $ 1,453   $ 1,272  Gross increases  tax positions in prior periods   219    88  Gross decreases  tax positions in prior periods   (31 )   (28 ) Gross increases  current-period tax positions   148    132  Settlements    (10 ) Lapse of statute of limitations   (2 )   (1 ) Unrecognized Tax Benefits  December 31,  $ 1,787   $ 1,453    ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1,787 and $1,453, of which $1,452 and $1,171 would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. These amounts are primarily associated with U.S. federal tax issues such as the tax benefits from the Foreign Sales Corporation/Extraterritorial Income (FSC/ETI) tax rules, the amount of research and development tax credits claimed, U.S. taxation of foreign earnings, and valuation issues regarding charitable contributions claimed. Also included in these amounts are accruals for domestic state tax issues such as the allocation of income among various state tax jurisdictions and the amount of state tax credits claimed. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will resolve some or all of the matters presently under consideration for 1998-2006 with the IRS. Depending on the timing and outcomes of the audit settlements, unrecognized tax benefits that affect the effective tax rate could increase earnings by up to $600 based on current estimates. The Research and Development credit expired on December 31, 2009. Congress is currently considering bills that will extend the credit. If the Research and Development credit is not legislatively enacted there would be an unfavorable impact on our 2010 effective income tax rate. Note 6  Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2009   2008  U.S. government contracts  $ 3,090   $ 2,675  Commercial customers   1,206    1,041  Reinsurance receivables   494    495  Sea Launch receivables, net of reserves   438   Non-U.S. military contracts   436    391  Other   162    1,054  Less valuation allowance   (41 )   (54 ) Total  $ 5,785   $ 5,602    ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes our accounts receivable under long-term contracts that were not billable or related to outstanding claims as of December 31: ##TABLE_START    Unbillable  Claims    2009  2008  2009  2008 Current  $ 1,273  $ 990  $ 33  $ 32 Expected to be collected after one year   450   467   151   120 Total  $ 1,723  $ 1,457  $ 184  $ 152  ##TABLE_END  Unbillable receivables on long-term contracts arise when the sales or revenues based on performance attainment, though appropriately recognized, cannot be billed yet under terms of the contract as of the balance sheet date. Accounts receivable related to claims are items that we believe are earned, but are subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate realization. Accounts receivable, other than those described above, expected to be collected after one year are not material. Sea Launch On June 22, 2009, the Sea Launch venture, in which Boeing Commercial Satellite Company (BCSC), a subsidiary of The Boeing Company, is a 40% partner with S.P. Koroley Rocket and Space Corporation Energia of Russia (25%), Aker ASA of Norway (Aker) (20%), PO Yuzhnoye Mashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukraine (10%) and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine (5%), filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the Chapter 11 Filing). The Chapter 11 Filing constituted an event of default or otherwise accelerated approximately $448 of outstanding indebtedness of Sea Launch for which we and an affiliate of Aker had previously issued credit guarantees on a joint-and-several basis. On July 1, 2009, we paid the entire $448 due under our guarantee. Among other options, we have rights to reimbursement from Sea Launch as well as the other Sea Launch partners, who are each obligated to reimburse us so that we contribute no more than our proportional ownership percentage (40% or $179) in Sea Launch of the aggregate guarantee payment obligations. On September 11, 2009, an affiliate of Aker executed a promissory note which obligates it to pay us $122 in three payments. The first payment of $40 was received in December 2009 and the final two payments are due in 2010. On October 19, 2009, we filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launch partners of the remaining $147 related to our guarantee payment. In addition, as a result of the Sea Launch bankruptcy, $523 of principal and interest associated with a loan by BCSC also become repayable by Sea Launch. Certain other Sea Launch partners have guaranteed portions of this loan (collectively, 40% of the total amount is guaranteed). We have also filed certain proofs of claim in the bankruptcy on account of various goods and services provided to Sea Launch prior to the bankruptcy filing. We intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and remedies against Sea Launch and the other Sea Launch partners with respect to the amounts described above. Receivables at December 31, 2009 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    Gross Receivables  Established Reserves  Net Receivable Balance Credit guarantee    Promissory note  $ 82   $ 82 Other   326  $ 179   147 Receivables related to partner loans (principal and interest)   523   314   209 Total  $ 931  $ 493  $ 438  ##TABLE_END In the event we are unable to secure reimbursement from Sea Launch or certain Sea Launch partners of $229 related to our payment under the credit guarantees and $209 related to the previously made loans to Sea Launch, we could incur additional pre-tax charges of up to $438.  Sea Launch management continues to operate the business and has obtained debtor-in-possession financing to address cash needs. In October 2009, the bankruptcy court granted Sea Launch a three month extension to file a reorganization plan, and Sea Launchs motion requesting an additional extension through April 14, 2010 is scheduled to be heard on March 4, 2010. Note 7  Inventories Inventories at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2009   2008  Long-term contracts in progress  $ 14,673   $ 14,051  Commercial aircraft programs   18,568    19,309  Commercial spare parts, used aircraft, general stock materials and other   5,004    4,340    38,245    37,700  Less advances and progress billings   (21,312 )   (22,088 )  $ 16,933   $ 15,612    ##TABLE_END Long-Term Contracts in Progress Delta launch program inventories that will be sold at cost to United Launch Alliance (ULA) under an inventory supply agreement that terminates on March 31, 2021 are included in long-term contracts in progress inventories. At December 31, 2009, and 2008, the inventory balance was $1,685 (net of $120 of advances received under the inventory supply agreement) and $1,822, of which $1,070 relates to yet unsold launches at December 31, 2009. ULA is continuing to assess the future of the Delta II program. In the event ULA is unable to sell additional Delta II inventory, earnings could be reduced by up to $62. Commercial Aircraft Programs Inventory includes deferred production costs which represent commercial aircraft programs production costs incurred on in-process and delivered units in excess of the estimated average cost of such units. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the balance of deferred production costs and unamortized tooling related to commercial aircraft programs in production, except the 777 and 787 programs, was insignificant relative to the programs balance-to-go estimates. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, all significant excess deferred production costs or unamortized tooling costs are recoverable from existing firm orders for the 777 program. For the 777 program, inventory included $510 and $1,223 for deferred production cost, and $211 and $255 of unamortized tooling at December 31, 2009 and 2008. For the 787 program, inventory included $3,885 and $3,021 of work in process (including deferred production costs), $2,187 and $2,548 of supplier advances, and $1,231 and $755 of tooling and other non-recurring costs at December 31, 2009 and 2008. In August 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test airplanes for the 787 program will not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. Therefore, $2,481 in costs previously recorded for the first three flight-test airplanes were reclassified from program inventory to Research and development expense during the third quarter of 2009. Additionally, production costs incurred from August to December 2009 of $212 related to these flight-test airplanes were also included in research and development expense. Commercial aircraft program inventory included amounts credited in cash or other consideration (early issue sales consideration), to airline customers totaling $1,577 and $1,271 at December 31, 2009 and 2008.  Commercial Spare Parts, Used Aircraft, General Stock Materials and Other As a normal course of our Commercial Airplanes segment production process, our inventory may include a small quantity of airplanes that are completed but unsold. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the value of completed but unsold aircraft in inventory was insignificant. Inventory balances included $235 subject to claims or other uncertainties relating to the A-12 program at December 31, 2009 and 2008 (See Note 20). Note 8  Customer Financing Customer financing at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2009   2008  Aircraft financing   Notes receivable  $ 779   $ 615  Investment in sales-type/finance leases   2,391    2,528  Operating lease equipment, at cost, less accumulated depreciation of $784 and $771   2,737    3,152  Other financing   Notes receivable   229    256  Less allowance for losses on receivables   (302 )    (269 )  $ 5,834   $ 6,282    ##TABLE_END The components of investment in sales-type/finance leases at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2009   2008  Minimum lease payments receivable  $ 3,147   $ 3,451  Estimated residual value of leased assets   677    735  Unearned income   (1,433 )   (1,658 )  $ 2,391   $ 2,528    ##TABLE_END Aircraft financing operating lease equipment primarily includes jet and commuter aircraft. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, aircraft financing operating lease equipment included $385 and $685 of equipment available for sale or re-lease. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had firm lease commitments for $345 and $305 of this equipment. When our Commercial Airplanes segment is unable to immediately sell used aircraft, it may place the aircraft under an operating lease. It may also provide customer financing with a note receivable. The carrying amount of the Commercial Airplanes segment used aircraft under operating leases and notes receivable included as a component of customer financing totaled $203 and $232 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Impaired receivables and the allowance for losses on those receivables consisted of the following at December 31: ##TABLE_START    2009  2008 Impaired receivables with no specific impairment allowance  $ 1  $ 163 Impaired receivables with specific impairment allowance   144   16 Allowance for losses on impaired receivables   2   8  ##TABLE_END  The average recorded investment in impaired receivables as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, was $162, $197, and $589, respectively. Income recognition is generally suspended for receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Income is recognized when receivables become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer. Interest income recognized on such receivables was $9, $14, and $50 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The change in the allowance for losses on receivables for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    Allowance for Losses  Beginning balance  January 1, 2007  $ (254 ) Customer financing valuation benefit/(provision)   60  Other   (1 ) Ending balance  December 31, 2007   (195 ) Customer financing valuation benefit/(provision)   (84 ) Reduction in customer financing assets   10  Ending balance  December 31, 2008   (269 ) Customer financing valuation benefit/(provision)   (45 ) Reduction in customer financing assets   12  Ending balance  December 31, 2009  $ (302 )   ##TABLE_END Aircraft financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance and may be subject to reduced valuation with market decline. Our financing portfolio has a concentration of various model aircraft. Aircraft financing carrying values related to major aircraft concentrations at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2009  2008 717 Aircraft ($662 and $694 accounted for as operating leases)*  $ 2,262  $ 2,365 757 Aircraft ($708 and $780 accounted for as operating leases)*   902   991 737 Aircraft ($400 and $453 accounted for as operating leases)   553   464 767 Aircraft ($154 and $181 accounted for as operating leases)   465   540 MD-11 Aircraft ($384 and $536 accounted for as operating leases)*   384   536  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START * Out of production aircraft ##TABLE_END We recorded charges related to customer financing asset impairment in operating earnings, primarily as a result of declines in projected future cash flows.

Interest capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 totaled $90, $99, and $117, respectively. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had $316 and $334 of operating lease properties, net of $262 and $242 of accumulated depreciation. Rental expense for leased properties was $273, $426, and $411, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For the same periods, these expenses, substantially all minimum rentals, were net of sublease income of $9, $14, and $26. At December 31, 2009, minimum rental payments under capital leases aggregated $83, and payments due under capital leases during the next five years are not material. Minimum rental payments under operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more aggregated $1,159, net of sublease payments of $11, at December 31, 2009. Non-cancellable future rentals due from customers for equipment on operating leases aggregated $136 at December 31, 2009. Payments due under operating leases net of sublease amounts and non-cancellable future rentals during the next five years are as follows: ##TABLE_START    2010  2011  2012  2013  2014 Minimum operating lease payments, net of sublease amounts  $ 213  $ 171  $ 129  $ 100  $ 88 Future rentals due from customers for equipment on operating leases   17   16   16   15   14  ##TABLE_END  We had accounts payable related to purchases of property, plant and equipment of $131, $157, and $150 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

It is reasonably possible that we may incur additional charges because of regulatory complexities, higher than expected costs and the risk of unidentified contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios which include highest cost estimates to remediate identified contamination at all sites based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. At December 31, 2009 and 2008 our reasonably possible highest cost estimate for all remediation sites exceeded our recorded liabilities by $948 and $1,206. Product Warranties The following table summarizes product warranty activity recorded for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. ##TABLE_START    Product Warranty Liabilities     2009   2008  Beginning balance  January 1  $ 959   $ 962  Additions for current year deliveries   167    140  Reductions for payments made   (237 )   (253 ) Changes in estimates   110    110  Ending balance  December 31  $ 999   $ 959    ##TABLE_END Discontinued Operations As part of the 2004 purchase and sale agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation related to the sale of Boeing Capital Corporations (BCC) Commercial Financial Services business, BCC is involved in a loss sharing arrangement for losses on transferred portfolio assets, such as asset sales, provisions for loss or asset impairment charges offset by gains from asset sales. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, our maximum future cash exposure to losses associated with the loss sharing arrangement was $234 and $232. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the accrued liability under the loss sharing arrangement was $77 and $39. Commercial Aircraft Commitments In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft, we have entered into specified-price trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used  aircraft upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. The total contractual trade-in value was $427 and $1,045 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. We anticipate that a significant portion of these commitments will not be exercised by customers. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is continually assessed, taking into consideration the current economic environment. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer. The estimated fair value of trade-in aircraft related to probable contractual trade-in commitments was $34 as of December 31, 2009. Trade-in commitment agreements have expiration dates from 2010 through 2023. Future Lease Commitments As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, future lease commitments on aircraft and other commitments not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position totaled $159 and $197. These lease commitments extend through 2020, and our intent is to recover these lease commitments through sublease arrangements. As of December 31, 2009, the future lease commitments on aircraft for each of the next five years were as follows: $16 in 2010, $16 in 2011, $16 in 2012, $16 in 2013, and $16 in 2014. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, Other accrued liabilities included $14 and $32 attributable to adverse commitments under these lease arrangements. Financing Commitments Financing commitments totaled $10,409 and $10,145 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. We anticipate that a significant portion of these commitments will not be exercised by the customers as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In connection with the formation of ULA, we and Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) each agreed to extend a line of credit to ULA of up to $200 to support its working capital requirements during the five-year period following December 1, 2006. ULA did not request any funds under the line of credit as of December 31, 2009. We and Lockheed have also each committed to provide ULA with up to $122 of additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. See Note 7. We have entered into standby letters of credit agreements and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $7,052 and $5,763 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. C-17 At December 31, 2009, our backlog included 11 C-17 aircraft currently under contract with the U.S. Air Force (USAF) as well as international orders for 7 C-17 aircraft. Backlog does not include 8 aircraft funded in the Fiscal Year 2009 (FY09) supplemental defense spending bill and 10 aircraft funded in the 2010 defense appropriations bill. At December 31, 2009, inventory expenditures and potential termination liabilities to suppliers for aircraft not included in backlog, primarily the 8 FY09 aircraft, totaled approximately $375. Should additional orders not materialize, it is reasonably possible that we will decide in 2010 to complete production of the C-17. We are still evaluating the full financial  impact of a potential production shut-down, including any recovery that would be available from the U.S. government. Such recovery from the U.S. government would not include the costs incurred by us resulting from our direction to suppliers to begin working on aircraft beyond those currently under contract with the USAF. Satellites Certain launch and satellite sales contracts include provisions that specify that we bear risk of loss associated with the launch phase through acceptance in orbit by the customer. We have historically purchased insurance to cover these exposures when allowed under the terms of the contract and when economically advisable. The current insurance market reflects high premium rates and also suffers from a lack of capacity to handle all insurance requirements. We make decisions on the procurement of insurance based on our analysis of risk. There is a contractual launch scheduled for 2010 for which full insurance coverage may not be available or, if available, could be prohibitively expensive. We will continue to review this risk. We estimate that the potential uninsured amount for this launch could be approximately $360. Company Owned Life Insurance McDonnell Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life insurance policies with a cash surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the cash surrender value was $360 and $331 and the total loans were $337 and $317. As we have the right to offset the loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Note 12  Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees. Third-Party Guarantees The following tables provide quantitative data regarding our third-party guarantees. The maximum potential payments represent a worst-case scenario, and do not necessarily reflect our expected results. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset our payments under guarantees. ##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2009  Maximum Potential Payments  Estimated Proceeds from Collateral/ Recourse  Carrying Amount of Liabilities* Contingent repurchase commitments  $ 3,958  $ 3,940  $ 7 Indemnifications to ULA   682    23 Other credit guarantees   119   109   2 Residual value guarantees   51   44   10  ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2008  Maximum Potential Payments  Estimated Proceeds from Collateral/ Recourse  Carrying Amount of Liabilities* Contingent repurchase commitments  $ 4,024  $ 4,014  $ 7 Indemnifications to ULA   1,184    7 Credit guarantees related to the Sea Launch venture**   451   271   180 Other credit guarantees   158   145   11 Residual value guarantees   51   47   10  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START *  Amounts included in Other accrued liabilities ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START **  See Note 6. ##TABLE_END Contingent Repurchase Commitments We have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers in conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft). Under these commitments, we agreed to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and the subsequent exercise by the customer of its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us. The repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase commitments is generally lower than the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated Proceeds from Collateral/Recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date. Indemnifications to ULA We agreed to indemnify ULA against losses in the event that costs associated with $1,360 of Delta launch program inventories included in contributed assets and $1,860 of Delta program inventories subject to an inventory supply agreement are not recoverable and allowable from existing and future orders. The term of the inventory indemnification extends to December 31, 2020. Since inception, ULA has consumed $1,111 of inventories that were contributed by us and has made advances of $120 to us under the inventory supply agreement. The table above includes indemnifications to ULA for contributed Delta launch program inventory of $277 and $813, plus $348 related to the pricing of certain contracts and $57 and $23 related to miscellaneous Delta contracts at December 31, 2009 and 2008. We agreed to indemnify ULA against potential losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the USAF for four satellite missions. We believe ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing. In December 2008, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value for two of the four satellite missions covered by the indemnification. In March 2009, the USAF issued a denial of that claim and in June 2009, ULA filed an appeal. During 2009, the USAF exercised its option for a third satellite mission. ULA intends to submit a claim to the USAF in 2010 to re-price the contract value of the third mission. If ULA is unsuccessful obtaining additional pricing, we may be responsible for a portion of the shortfall and may record up to $382 in pre-tax losses associated with the four missions. Other Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees, principally to facilitate the sale and/or financing of commercial aircraft. Under these arrangements, we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that lease or loan payments are not made by the original lessee or debtor or certain specified services are not performed. A substantial portion of these guarantees has been extended on behalf of original lessees or debtors with less than investment-grade credit. Our commercial aircraft credit-related guarantees are collateralized by the underlying commercial aircraft and certain other assets. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire within the next 11 years.  Residual Value Guarantees We have issued various residual value guarantees principally to facilitate the sale and financing of certain commercial aircraft. Under these guarantees, we are obligated to make payments to the guaranteed party if the related aircraft or equipment fair values fall below a specified amount at a future time. These obligations are collateralized principally by commercial aircraft and expire within the next 9 years. Other Indemnifications In conjunction with our sales of the Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and the sale of our Commercial Airplanes facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma in 2005, we provided indemnifications to the buyers relating to pre-closing environmental contamination and certain other items. The terms of the indemnifications are indefinite. As it is impossible to assess whether there will be damages in the future or the amounts thereof (if any), we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these guarantees. Therefore, no liability has been recorded. Industrial Revenue Bonds Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRBs) issued by the City of Wichita are used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property at our Wichita site. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a ten-year property tax abatement and a sales tax exemption from the Kansas Department of Revenue. We record the property on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, along with a capital lease obligation to repay the proceeds of the IRB. We have also purchased the IRBs and therefore are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the property purchased with the IRB proceeds. The capital lease obligation and IRB asset are recorded net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the assets and liabilities associated with the City of Wichita IRBs were $856 and $887. Note 13  Debt On March 9, 2009, we filed a public shelf registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities and common stock. On March 13, 2009, we issued notes totaling $1,850, which included $700 bearing an interest rate of 5% due March 15, 2014, $650 bearing an interest rate of 6% due March 15, 2019 and $500 bearing an interest rate of 6.875% due March 15, 2039. The net proceeds after deducting the discount, underwriting fees and issuance costs were $1,817. On July 28, 2009, we issued notes totaling $1,950, which included $750 bearing an interest rate of 3.5% due February 15, 2015, $750 bearing an interest rate of 4.875% due February 15, 2020 and $450 bearing an interest rate of 5.875% due February 15, 2040. The net proceeds after deducting the discount, underwriting fees and issuance costs were $1,914. On November 20, 2009, we issued notes totaling $1,200, which included $700 bearing an interest rate of 1.875% due November 20, 2012, and $500 bearing an interest rate of 3.750% due November 20, 2016. The net proceeds after deducting the discount, underwriting fees and issuance costs were $1,184. We may redeem each series of notes issued in 2009 at any time prior to maturity, in whole or in part, upon at least 30 days notice, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest on such notes to the redemption date. The notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. On October 30, 2008, BCC filed a public shelf registration for up to $5,000 of debt securities with the SEC that became effective on November 12, 2008. On October 27, 2009, BCC issued notes totaling  $1,000, which included $500 bearing an interest rate of 3.25% due October 27, 2014 and $500 bearing an interest rate of 4.70% due October 27, 2019. The net proceeds after deducting the discount, underwriting fees and issuance costs were $994. The remaining $4,000 remains available for potential debt issuance. The availability of funding under BCCs shelf registration is dependent on investor demand and market conditions. Total debt interest incurred, including amounts capitalized, was $610, $520, and $591 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Interest expense recorded by BCC is reflected as a separate line item on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and is included in earnings from operations. Total Company interest payments were $502, $493, and $616 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. We have $3,525 currently available under credit line agreements, of which $2,000 is a 5-year credit facility expiring in November 2012 and $1,525 is a 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in November 2010. Both the 5-year and 364-day credit facilities have a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration dates. We have given BCC exclusive access to $1,500 under these arrangements. We continue to be in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt or credit facility agreements, including those at BCC. Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2009  2008    Consolidated Total  BCC Only  Consolidated Total  BCC Only Unsecured debt securities  $ 644  $ 644  $ 514  $ 514 Non-recourse debt and notes   24   6   24   5 Capital lease obligations   14   9   9   9 Other notes   25      13     $ 707  $ 659  $ 560  $ 528  ##TABLE_END Debt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2009  2008 Boeing Capital Corporation debt:   Unsecured debt securities 1.480%  7.580% due through 2023  $ 3,952  $ 3,516 Non-recourse debt and notes 1.330%  5.790% notes due through 2013   61   66 Capital lease obligations 0.870% due through 2015   62   70 Subtotal Boeing Capital Corporation debt  $ 4,075  $ 3,652 Other Boeing debt:   Unsecured debentures and notes 1.875%  9.750% due through 2043  $ 8,349  $ 3,406 Non-recourse debt and notes Enhanced equipment trust   360   380 Capital lease obligations due through 2017   14   1 Other notes   126   73 Subtotal other Boeing debt  $ 8,849  $ 3,860 Total debt  $ 12,924  $ 7,512  ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2009, $123 of BCC debt was collateralized by portfolio assets and underlying equipment totaling $209. The debt consists of the 0.87% to 5.79% notes due through 2015.  Maturities of long-term debt for the next five years are as follows: ##TABLE_START    2010  2011  2012  2013  2014 BCC  $ 645  $ 798  $ 878  $ 652  $ 526 Other Boeing   49   91   1,077   628   763  $ 694  $ 889  $ 1,955  $ 1,280  $ 1,289  ##TABLE_END Note 14  Postretirement Plans We have various pension plans covering substantially all employees. We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans participants, and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long term with the growth of obligations for future benefit payments. We also have postretirement benefits other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for approximately half those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered by most United Auto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage. The funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). We have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Pension plan assets, net and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in Other accrued liabilities. Effective December 31, 2008, a new accounting standard on defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans requires us to measure plan assets and benefit obligations at fiscal year end. We previously performed this measurement at September 30 of each year. Beginning in fourth quarter of 2007 in accordance with this standard, we eliminated the use of a three-month lag period when recognizing the impact of curtailments or settlements and, instead, recognize these amounts in the period in which they occur. As a result of implementing the measurement date provisions of this standard, we recorded an additional quarter of pension and other postretirement benefit (OPB) cost as of January 1, 2008 as a $178 decrease to Retained earnings and a $92 decrease to Accumulated other comprehensive loss, which resulted in a net decrease of $86 to Shareholders equity. The provisions of this standard do not permit retrospective application.

Six of our eight major pension plans have ABOs that exceed plan assets at December 31, 2009. Key information for all plans with ABO in excess of plan assets as of December 31, is as follows: ##TABLE_START    2009  2008 Projected benefit obligation  $ 26,141  $ 48,658 Accumulated benefit obligation   24,227   44,863 Fair value of plan assets   22,205   40,225  ##TABLE_END The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 reduced our APBO by $497 and $491 at December 31, 2009 and 2008. These reductions/actuarial gains are amortized over the expected average future service of current employees. Assumptions ##TABLE_START    December 31   September 30     2009   2008   2007   2006  Discount rate: pension and OPB  5.80 %  6.10 %  6.20 %  5.90 % Expected return on plan assets  8.00 %  8.00 %  8.25 %  8.25 % Rate of compensation increase  5.50 %  5.50 %  5.50 %  5.50 %   ##TABLE_END The discount rate for each pension plan is determined by discounting the plans expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high quality bonds that are rated as Aa or better by Moodys as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yields developed from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. A portfolio of about 400 bonds is used to construct the yield curve. Since corporate bond yields are generally not available at maturities beyond 30 years, it is assumed that spot rates will remain level beyond that 30-year point. The present value of each plans benefits is calculated by applying the spot/discount rates to projected benefit cash flows. All bonds are U.S. issues, with a minimum outstanding of $50. The disclosed rate is the average rate for all the plans, weighted by the projected benefit obligation. As of December 31, 2009, the weighted average was 5.80%, and the rates for individual plans ranged from 3.80% to 6.40%. As of December 31, 2008, the weighted average was 6.10%, and the rates for individual plans ranged from 4.25% to 6.60%. The pension funds expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns,  the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the upcoming plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five-year moving average of plan assets. As of December 31, 2009, the MRVA is approximately $3,700 greater than the fair market value of assets. Assumed health care cost trend rates as of December 31, were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2009   2008  Health care cost trend rate assumed next year  7.00 %  7.50 % Ultimate trend rate  5.00 %  5.00 % Year that trend reached ultimate rate  2014   2014    ##TABLE_END Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. To determine the health care cost trend rates we look at a combination of information including ongoing claims cost monitoring, annual statistical analyses of claims data, reconciliation of forecast claims against actual claims, review of trend assumptions of other plan sponsors and national health trends, and adjustments for plan design changes, workforce changes, and changes in plan participant behavior. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect: ##TABLE_START    Increase  Decrease  Effect on postretirement benefit obligation  $ 617  $ (541 ) Effect on total of service and interest cost   57   (50 )   ##TABLE_END Plan Assets Investment Strategy The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive, total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified. We update our long-term, strategic asset allocations every three-to-five years. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investment benchmarks for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions (such as private equity and real estate), and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced on a monthly basis.  The actual allocations for the pension assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and target allocations by asset class, are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Percentage of Plan Assets   Target Allocations  Asset Class  2009   2008   2009   2008  Fixed income  50 %  55 %  45 %  45 % Global equity  34   28   28   28  Real estate and real assets  4   4   10   10  Private equity  5   5   6   6  Global strategies  4   5   5   5  Hedge funds  3   3   6   6  Total  100 %  100 %  100 %  100 %   ##TABLE_END Fixed income securities are invested broadly and primarily in long duration instruments. Global equity securities are invested broadly in U.S. and non-U.S. companies which are in various industries and countries and through a range of market capitalizations. Real estate and real assets include global private investments and publicly traded investments (such as REITs in the case of real estate). Real estate includes but is not limited to investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include but are not limited to investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber) and infrastructure. Private equity investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) and fund-of-funds that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies. Global strategies seek to capitalize on inefficiencies identified across different asset classes or markets, primarily using long-short positions in derivatives and physical securities. Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to event driven, relative value, long-short and market neutral. A well-diversified number of hedge funds are held. Investment managers are retained for explicit investment roles specified by contractual investment guidelines. Certain investment managers are authorized to invest in derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve the desired market exposure of a security or an index, transfer value-added performance between asset classes, achieve the desired currency exposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation. As a percentage of total plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were 6.0% and 6.2% for fixed income, including to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and 0.0% and 7.9% for global equity and currency overlay at December 31, 2009 and 2008. In November 2009, the Company elected to contribute $1,500 of our common stock to the pension fund. An independent fiduciary was retained to manage and liquidate the stock over time at its discretion. Plan assets included $1,581 and $0 of our common stock as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Risk Management In managing the plan assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability management and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach and are integral to the overall investment strategy. Further, asset classes are constructed to achieve diversification by investment strategy, by investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding.  Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored regularly through the custodian. Credit parameters for counterparties have been established for managers permitted to trade over-the-counter derivatives. Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2009. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs. ##TABLE_START    Total   Level 1  Level 2   Level 3 Fixed income securities     Corporate  $ 13,259    $ 13,254   $ 5 U.S. government and agencies   3,886     3,886   Mortgage backed and asset backed securities   916     893    23 Other   2,628   $ 19   2,609   Derivatives     Assets   33     33   Liabilities   (93 )    (93 )  Cash equivalents and other short-term investments   2,068    1,679   389   Currency overlay derivatives     Assets   107     107   Liabilities   (94 )    (94 )  Global equity securities     Common and preferred stock   11,394    11,325   69   Boeing company stock   1,581    1,581   Common/collective/pooled funds   2,574    89   2,485   Derivatives     Assets   9     9   Liabilities   (10 )    (10 )  Private equity   2,300    9    2,291 Real estate and real assets   1,784    442   5    1,337 Global strategies   1,676    484   1,192   Hedge funds   1,347       336    1,011 Total  $ 45,365   $ 15,628  $ 25,070   $ 4,667  Cash  $ 125     Receivables   641     Payables   (321 )           Total  $ 45,810      ##TABLE_END Fixed income securities are primarily valued using a market approach with inputs that include broker quotes, benchmark yields, base spreads and reported trades. Cash equivalents and other short-term investments, which are used to pay benefits, are primarily held in registered money market funds which are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Other cash equivalent and short-term investments are valued daily by the fund using a market approach with inputs that include quoted market prices for similar instruments. Common and preferred stock equity securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Common/collective/pooled funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their net asset values (NAVs) that are calculated by the  investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Active currency managers, through an overlay program, invest in a broad set of currency derivatives. Derivatives leveled in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued using an income approach with inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates. Exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Private equity LP valuations are reported by the fund manager and are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. Real estate and real asset fund values are primarily reported by the fund manager and are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. Publically traded REITs are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Global strategies are primarily limited liability company (LLC) or mutual fund structures. The LLCs are primarily valued based on NAVs calculated by the fund and have monthly liquidity. Global strategies mutual funds are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Hedge funds consist of fund-of-fund LLC or commingled fund structures. The LLCs are primarily valued based on NAVs calculated by the fund and are not publicly available. Liquidity for the LLCs is monthly and is subject to liquidity of the underlying funds. The commingled fund NAV is calculated by the manager on a daily basis and has monthly liquidity. Some of our assets, primarily our private equity, real estate and real assets, hedge funds and global strategies, do not have readily determinable market values given the specific investment structures involved and the nature of the underlying investments. For the December 31, 2009 plan asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used where possible. For assets without readily determinable values, estimates were derived from investment manager discussions focusing on underlying fundamentals and significant events. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) we use net asset values, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. The following table presents a reconciliation of Level 3 assets held during the year ended December 31, 2009. ##TABLE_START    January 1, 2009 Balance  Net Realized and Unrealized Gains/ (Losses)   Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements   Net Transfers Into/(Out of) Level 3  December 31, 2009 Balance Fixed income securities      Corporate  $ 9   $ (4 )   $ 5 Mortgage backed and asset backed securities   49  $ 1    (32 )  $ 5   23 Private equity   2,020   142    129     2,291 Real estate and real assets   1,629   (505 )   213     1,337 Hedge funds   885   126           1,011 Total  $ 4,592  $ (236 )  $ 306   $ 5  $ 4,667  ##TABLE_END  OPB Plan Assets The majority of OPB plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised of approximately 60% equities and 40% debt securities. The index fund is valued using a market approach based on the quoted market price of an identical instrument (Level 1). The expected rate of return on these assets does not have a material effect on the net periodic benefit cost. Cash Flows Contributions Required pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) as well as rules governing funding of our non-U.S. pension plans, are not expected to be material in 2010. In 2010 required contributions to our pension plans are not expected to exceed $100. We expect that if interest rates remain at their current levels, discount rates for ERISA determinations will likely decline in future years because of retrospective averaging, and as a result, contributions in future years are expected to increase. We expect to contribute approximately $14 to our OPB plans in 2010. Estimated Future Benefit Payments The table below reflects the total pension benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants share of the cost, which is funded by participant contributions. OPB payments reflect our portion only. ##TABLE_START    Pensions  Other Postretirement Benefits 2010  $ 2,665  $ 527 2011   2,764   551 2012   2,872   562 2013   3,008   577 2014   3,130   592 2015  2019   17,843   3,188  ##TABLE_END Termination Provisions Certain of the pension plans provide that, in the event there is a change in control of the Company which is not approved by the Board of Directors and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required by ERISA, and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits in our group insurance benefit programs. We have an agreement with the U.S. government with respect to certain pension plans. Under the agreement, should we terminate any of the plans under conditions in which the plans assets exceed that plans obligations, the U.S. government will be entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plans assets based on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts. 401(k) Plans We provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expense for these defined contribution plans was $591, $571 and $536 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  Note 15  Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements Share-Based Compensation Our 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended on April 27, 2009, permits awards of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, stock units, Performance Shares, performance units and other incentives to our employees, officers, consultants and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock available for issuance under the amended plan will not exceed 80,000,000 and no more than an aggregate of 16,000,000 shares are available for issuance as restricted stock awards. Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to meet any requirements to issue shares during 2010. Share-based plans expense is primarily included in general and administrative expense since it is incentive compensation issued primarily to our executives. The share-based plans expense and related income tax benefit follow: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009  2008  2007 Stock options  $ 111  $ 119  $ 79 Restricted stock units and other awards   55   25   36 ShareValue Trust   71   61   78 Performance Shares   1   4   94 Share-based plans expense  $ 238  $ 209  $ 287  Income tax benefit  $ 89  $ 79  $ 118  ##TABLE_END Stock Options Options have been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. For stock options issued prior to 2006, vesting is generally over a five-year service period with portions of a grant becoming exercisable at one year, three years and five years after the date of grant. In the event an employee has a termination of employment due to retirement, layoff, disability or death, the employee (or beneficiary) immediately vests in grants that have been outstanding for at least one year. On February 23, 2009, February 25, 2008, and February 26, 2007, we granted to our executives 7,423,242, 6,411,300, and 5,334,700 options, respectively, with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. The stock options vest over a period of three years, with 34% vesting after the first year, 33% vesting after the second year and the remaining 33% vesting after the third year. The options expire 10 years after the date of grant. If an executive terminates employment for any reason, the non-vested portion of the stock option will not vest and all rights to the non-vested portion will terminate completely.  Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2009 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (Shares in thousands)  Shares   Weighted Average Exercise Price  Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (years)  Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) Number of shares under option:     Outstanding at beginning of year  20,577   $ 73.42   Granted  7,546    35.71   Exercised  (253 )   40.84   Forfeited  (857 )   62.00   Expired  (676 )   48.81      Outstanding at end of year  26,337   $ 63.93  7.09  $ 179 Exercisable at end of year  13,940   $ 70.33  5.61  $ 47  ##TABLE_END The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $2, $22, and $192 during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash received from options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $10, $44, and $209 with a related tax benefit of $1, $6, and $65, respectively, derived from the compensation deductions resulting from these option exercises. At December 31, 2009, there was $98 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the Stock Option plan which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.6 years. The total fair value of stock options vested during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $114, $82, and $43, respectively. The fair values of options were estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: ##TABLE_START Grant Year  Grant Date  Expected Life  Expected Volatility   Dividend Yield   Risk Free Interest Rate   Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value 2009  2/23/09  6 years  39.0 %  2.4 %  2.03 %  $ 11.12 2008  2/25/08  6 years  28.8 %  1.7 %  3.20 %   23.47 2007  2/26/07  6 years  28.4 %  1.7 %  4.62 %   27.31  ##TABLE_END The expected volatility of the stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock volatility and the volatility levels implied on the grant date by actively traded option contracts on our common stock. We determined the expected term of the stock option grants to be 6 years, calculated using the simplified method in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 107, Valuation of Share-Based Payment Arrangements for Public Companies . We used the simplified method since we changed the vesting terms, tax treatment and the recipients of our stock options beginning in 2006 such that we believe our historical data no longer provides a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. Restricted Stock Units and Other Awards In 2009, we modified the components of our long-term incentive program while maintaining substantially the same total award value as in prior years. Prior to the modification, Performance Awards and options each comprised 50% of the total award value. Beginning in 2009, Performance Awards still represent 50% of the value and stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) each represent 25% of the total value.  On February 23, 2009, we granted to our executives 2,144,501 RSUs as part of our long-term incentive program, with a fair value of $35.57 per share. The RSUs vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will immediately vest on a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year performance period. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate completely. In addition to RSUs awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant restricted stock to employees for various achievements, referred to as other stock award units. The fair values of all stock units are estimated using the average stock price on the date of grant. Stock units settle in common stock on a one-for-one basis and are not contingent upon stock price. Stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2009 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (Units in thousands)  Incentive Program Restricted Stock Units   Other Stock Award Units  Number of units:   Outstanding at beginning of year   239    1,601  Granted   2,344    329  Dividends   61    57  Forfeited   (124 )   (22 ) Distributed   (134 )   (391 ) Outstanding at end of year   2,386    1,574  Unrecognized compensation cost at December 31, 2009  $ 66   $ 40  Weighted average remaining contractual life (years)   2.1    3.0    ##TABLE_END ShareValue Trust The ShareValue Trust, established effective July 1, 1996, is a 14-year irrevocable trust that holds our common stock, receives dividends, and distributes to employees the appreciation in value above a 3% per annum threshold rate of return at the end of each period. The total compensation expense to be recognized over the life of the trust was determined using a binomial option-pricing model. The ShareValue Trust is accounted for as a contra-equity account and stated at market value. Market value adjustments are offset to Additional paid-in capital. At December 31, 2009, there was $36 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the ShareValue Trust which is expected to be recognized during the six months ending June 30, 2010. The Trust was split between two funds, fund 1 and fund 2, upon its initial funding. Based on the average stock price of $66.15 as of June 30, 2008, the market value of fund 2 exceeded the threshold of $1,028 by $236. This excess was paid in Boeing common stock, except for partial shares and distributions to non-U.S. employees and beneficiaries of deceased participants, which was paid in cash. At December 31, 2009 the Trust held 29,563,324 shares, of which 13,216,726 shares were included in fund 1. If on June 30, 2010, the market value of fund 1 exceeds the appreciation threshold stock price, the amount in excess of the threshold will be distributed to employees in shares of common stock. At December 31, 2009 the threshold price was $85.46 per share. The Trust will terminate in 2010, and any undistributed shares will be transferred to us upon termination.  Performance Shares Prior to 2006, Performance Shares were a significant component of our long-term incentive compensation. Performance Shares are stock units that are convertible to common stock, on a one-to-one basis, contingent upon stock price performance. If, at any time up to five years after award, the stock price reaches and maintains for 20 consecutive days a price equal to stated price growth targets, a stated percentage (up to 125%) of the Performance Shares awarded are vested and convertible to common stock. Performance Shares activity for the year ended December 31, 2009 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (Shares in thousands)  Shares  Number of Performance Shares:  Outstanding at beginning of year  747  Dividend  29  Forfeited  (4 ) Outstanding at end of year  772  Outstanding at end of year not contingent on future employment  439    ##TABLE_END The following table provides additional information regarding potentially convertible and converted or deferred Performance Shares. ##TABLE_START Grant Date  Expiration Date  Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value  Cumulative Vested at December 31,   Shares Convertible at December 31, (Shares in thousands)        2009   2009  2008 2/28/2005  2/28/2010  $ 33.05  90 %  772  747  ##TABLE_END Performance Shares granted in 2005 were measured on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model. For years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded $0, $0 and $54, respectively, to accelerate the amortization of compensation cost for those Performance Shares converted to common stock or deferred as stock or cash at the employees election. Additionally, certain Performance Shares that have a cash settlement, are re-measured each balance sheet date using a Monte Carlo model and are recalculated as a liability. Liability awards vesting and transferred into deferred compensation plans totaled $0, $0 and $48 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Other Compensation Arrangements Performance Awards Performance Awards are cash units that payout based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a three-year period. Each unit has an initial value of $100 dollars. The amount payable at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars per unit, depending on the Companys performance against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to pay these awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on the estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we granted Performance Awards to our executives with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals for the three-year periods ending December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out for the 2009, 2008 and 2007 Performance Awards is $304, $289 and $47.  During the first quarter of 2006, we granted Performance Awards to our executives with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals for the three-year period ending December 31, 2008. The payout for these awards of $137 occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Deferred Compensation The Company has a deferred compensation plan which permits executives to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus, and certain other incentive awards. Prior to May 1, 2006, employees who participated in the deferred compensation plan could choose to defer in either an interest earning account or a Boeing stock unit account. Effective May 1, 2006, participants can diversify deferred compensation among 19 investment funds including the interest earning account and the Boeing stock unit account. Total expense/(income) related to deferred compensation was $158, ($223), and $51 in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Additionally, for employees who elected to defer their compensation in stock units prior to January 1, 2006, the Company matched 25% of the deferral with additional stock units. Effective January 1, 2006, all matching contributions are settled in stock upon retirement. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred compensation liability which is being marked to market was $1,143 and $1,074. Note 16  Shareholders Equity On October 29, 2007, the Board approved the repurchase of up to $7 billion of common stock (the Program). Unless terminated earlier by a Board resolution, the Program will expire when we have used all authorized funds for repurchase. At December 31, 2009, $3,610 in shares may still be purchased under the Program. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, there were 1,200,000,000 common shared authorized. Twenty million shares of authorized preferred stock remain unissued. Changes in Share Balances The following table shows changes in each class of shares: ##TABLE_START    Common Stock  Treasury Stock   ShareValue Trust  Balance January 1, 2007  1,012,261,159  223,522,176   30,903,026  Issued   (8,300,606 )  Acquired    28,995,600   459,824  Balance December 31, 2007  1,012,261,159  244,217,170   31,362,850  Issued   (629,111 )  Acquired   42,073,885   658,582  Payout       (3,560,663 ) Balance December 31, 2008  1,012,261,159  285,661,944   28,460,769  Issued   (30,428,387 )  Acquired    1,173,152   1,102,555  Balance December 31, 2009  1,012,261,159  256,406,709   29,563,324    ##TABLE_END  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The components of Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2009   2008  Pension and postretirement adjustments  $ (12,154 )  $ (13,421 ) Unrealized (losses)/gains on derivative instruments, net of reclassification adjustments   67    (101 ) Unrealized (losses)/gains on certain investments, net of reclassification adjustments   (6 )   (67 ) Foreign currency translation adjustments   216    64  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  $ (11,877 )  $ (13,525 )   ##TABLE_END Note 17  Derivative Financial Instruments Cash Flow Hedges Our cash flow hedges include certain interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts and commodity purchase contracts. Interest rate swap contracts under which we agree to pay fixed rates of interest are designated as cash flow hedges of variable-rate debt obligations. We use foreign currency forward contracts and options to manage currency risk associated with certain forecasted transactions, specifically forecasted sales and purchases made in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency derivative contracts hedge forecasted transactions principally occurring within five years in the future, with certain contracts hedging transactions up to 2021. We use commodity derivatives, such as fixed-price purchase commitments, to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. These include commitments to purchase electricity at fixed prices through 2015. Fair Value Hedges Interest rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt. The net change in fair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in Boeing Capital Corporation interest expense. Ineffectiveness related to the interest rate swaps was insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment We also hold certain derivative instruments, primarily foreign currency forward contracts, for risk management purposes but without electing any form of hedge accounting.  Notional Amounts and Fair Values The fair values of derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The notional amounts and fair values as of December 31, were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Notional amounts 1  Other assets   Other accrued liabilities     2009  2008  2009   2008   2009   2008  Derivatives designated as hedging instruments       Foreign exchange contracts  $ 2,353  $ 1,992  $ 233   $ 26   $ (22 )  $ (39 ) Interest rate contracts   1,475   817   32    48    (18 )   (3 ) Commodity contracts   189   147           (88 )   (75 )   4,017   2,956   265    74    (128 )   (117 ) Derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment       Foreign exchange contracts   693   646   32    42    (99 )   (128 ) Warrants      21       10          Total derivatives   4,710   3,623   297    126    (227 )   (245 ) Netting arrangements         (119 )   (64 )   119    64  Net recorded balance    $ 178   $ 62   $ (108 )  $ (181 )   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1  Notional amounts represent the gross contract/notional amount of the derivatives outstanding. ##TABLE_END The effects of our cash flow hedges on Accumulated other comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2009 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2009  Location gains/(losses) are recognized Effective portion recognized in other comprehensive income, net of taxes   Foreign exchange contracts  $ 180  Accumulated other comprehensive loss   Commodity contracts   (24)  Accumulated other comprehensive loss ##TABLE_END For the year ended December 31, 2009, we reclassified a net loss of $16 (pre-tax) from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings. Based on our portfolio of cash flow hedges, we expect to reclassify gains of $36 (pre-tax) during the next 12 months. We have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. For foreign exchange contracts with original maturities of at least five years, our derivative counterparties could require settlement if we default on our 5-year credit facility, expiring November 2012. For commodity contracts, our counterparties could require collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and commodity contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a liability position at December 31, 2009 is $88. At December 31, 2009, there were no aggregate derivative positions requiring the posting of collateral.  Note 18  Significant Group Concentrations of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments involving potential credit risk are predominantly with commercial aircraft customers and the U.S. government. Of the $11,962 in Gross Accounts receivable and Gross Customer financing included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2009, $6,154 related to commercial aircraft customers ($462 of Accounts receivable and $5,692 of Customer financing) and $3,119 related to the U.S. government. Of the $6,136 in Gross Customer financing, $5,568 related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. AirTran Airways, American Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines and Continental Airlines were associated with 25%, 15%, 7% and 7%, respectively, of our financing portfolio. Financing for aircraft is collateralized by security in the related asset. As of December 31, 2009, there was $10,409 of financing commitments related to aircraft on order including options and proposed as part of sales campaigns described in Note 11, of which $9,266 related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. Fixed-Price Development Programs Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work. Significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include AEWC, International KC-767 Tankers and commercial and military satellites. Significant Commercial Airplanes development programs include the 787 and 747-8. The operational and technical complexities of these programs create financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost and revenue estimates could also result in lower margins or a material charge if the program has or is determined to have a reach-forward loss. Other Risk As of December 31, 2009, approximately 37% of our total workforce was represented by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 3% of our total workforce was represented by agreements expiring during 2010.  Note 19  Fair Value Measurements The following tables present our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs. ##TABLE_START        Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2009    Total   Level 1  Level 2   Level 3 Assets     Money market funds  $ 3,575   $ 3,575   Available-for-sale investments:     Debt:     Residential mortgage-backed securities   107    $ 107   Other debt obligations   5     $ 5 Equity   27    27   Derivatives   178       178     Total assets  $ 3,892   $ 3,602  $ 285   $ 5  Liabilities     Derivatives  $ (108 )     $ (108 )    Total liabilities  $ (108 )   $ (108 )   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START        Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2008    Total   Level 1  Level 2   Level 3 Assets     Money market funds  $ 2,128   $ 2,128   Available-for-sale debt investments:     Residential mortgage-backed securities   196    $ 196   Other debt obligations   156     151   $ 5 Derivatives   62       52    10 Total assets  $ 2,542   $ 2,128  $ 399   $ 15  Liabilities     Derivatives  $ (181 )     $ (181 )    Total liabilities  $ (181 )   $ (181 )   ##TABLE_END Money market funds and equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Residential mortgage-backed securities are valued using an income approach based on prepayment speeds, yields, discount margin and collateral performance. The other debt securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on benchmark yields, reported trades and broker/dealer quotes. Derivatives include foreign currency, commodity, interest rate contracts and warrants. Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued  using an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve. The fair value of warrants is based on a third-party options model and principal inputs of stock price, volatility and time to expiry. The following table presents our assets that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis for the years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START    2009   2008     Carrying Value  Total Losses   Carrying Value  Total Losses  Equipment under operating leases  $ 164  $ (57 )   Assets held for sale or re-lease   35   (18 )   Property, plant and equipment   13   (13 )   Receivables   1   (6 )  $ 8  $ (8 ) Total  $ 213  $ (94 )  $ 8  $ (8 )   ##TABLE_END Fair Value Disclosures The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The carrying values and estimated fair values were as follows at December 31: ##TABLE_START    2009   2008     Carrying Amount   Fair Value   Carrying Amount   Fair Value  Assets     Accounts receivable, net  $ 5,785   $ 5,658   $ 5,602   $ 5,443  Notes receivable   1,045    1,072    950    954  Liabilities     Debt, excluding capital lease obligations   (12,848 )   (13,809 )   (7,441 )   (7,923 ) Accounts payable   (7,096 )   (7,063 )   (5,871 )   (5,871 ) Residual value and credit guarantees   (35 )   (20 )   (208 )   (52 ) Contingent repurchase commitments   (7 )   (63 )   (7 )   (38 )   ##TABLE_END The fair values of the Accounts receivable and Accounts payable are based on current market rates for loans of the same risk and maturities. The fair values of our variable rate notes receivable that reprice frequently approximate their carrying values. The fair values of fixed rate notes receivable are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt is based on current market yields for our debt traded in the secondary market. The fair values of the residual value guarantees and contingent repurchase commitments are determined using a Black Futures Options formula and includes such assumptions as the expected value of the aircraft on the settlement date, volatility of aircraft prices, time until settlement and the risk free discount rate. The fair value of the credit guarantees is estimated based on the expected cash flows of those commitments, given the creditors probability of default, and discounted using the risk free rate. With regard to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of future financing commitments because the amount and timing of funding those commitments are uncertain.  Note 20  Legal Proceedings Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts and other matters are pending against us. Potentially material contingencies are discussed below. We are subject to various U.S. government investigations, from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted. Such proceedings involve, or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such government disputes and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, except as set forth below. A-12 Litigation In 1991, the U.S. Navy notified McDonnell Douglas Corporation (now merged into The Boeing Company) and General Dynamics Corporation (together, the Team) that it was terminating for default the Teams contract for development and initial production of the A-12 aircraft. The Team had full responsibility for performance of the contract and both contractors are jointly and severally liable for any potential liabilities resulting from the termination. The Team filed a legal action to contest the Navys default termination, to assert its rights to convert the termination to one for the convenience of the government, and to obtain payment for work done and costs incurred on the A-12 contract but not paid to date. As of December 31, 2009, inventories included approximately $585 of recorded costs on the A-12 contract, against which we have established a loss provision of $350. The amount of the provision, which was established in 1990, was based on McDonnell Douglas Corporations belief, supported by an opinion of outside counsel, that the termination for default would be converted to a termination for convenience, and that the best estimate of possible loss on termination for convenience was $350. On August 31, 2001, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a decision after trial upholding the governments default termination of the A-12 contract. In 2003, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, finding that the trial court had applied the wrong legal standard, vacated the trial courts 2001 decision and ordered the case sent back to that court for further proceedings. On May 3, 2007, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a decision upholding the governments default termination of the A-12 contract. We filed a Notice of Appeal on May 4, 2007 with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On June 2, 2009, the Court of Appeals rendered an opinion affirming the trial courts 2007 decision sustaining the governments default termination. On August 14, 2009, we filed a Combined Petition for Panel Rehearing and for Rehearing En Banc in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On November 24, 2009, the Court denied our Combined Petition. We believe that the ruling of the Court of Appeals upholding the default termination is erroneous and in conflict with the governing law, and we intend to file a Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Supreme Court on or before March 24, 2010. On December 29, 2009, the Department of the Navy sent letters to the Team requesting payment of $1,352 in unliquidated progress payments, plus applicable interest. We believe that the U.S. government is not entitled to repayment of any progress payments at this time and have advised the Department of the Navy of our position. We believe that the termination for default is contrary to law and fact and that the loss provision established by McDonnell Douglas Corporation in 1990, which was supported by an opinion from outside counsel, continues to provide adequately for the reasonably possible reduction in value of A-12 net contracts in process as of December 31, 2009. Final resolution of the A-12 litigation will depend on the outcome of further proceedings or possible negotiations with the U.S. government. We expect the United States Supreme Court to decide whether or not to review the Court of Appeals decision in  2010, and if it decides to review the case, to issue a decision in 2010 or 2011. If the United States Supreme Court declines review of the Court of Appeals decision, or if it reviews the decision and determines, contrary to our belief, that a termination for default was appropriate, we could incur an additional loss of up to $275, consisting principally of $235 of remaining inventory costs. If the courts further hold that a money judgment should be entered against the Team, we could be required to pay the U.S. government up to one-half of the unliquidated progress payments of $1,350 plus statutory interest from February 1991 (currently totaling up to $1,485). In that event, our loss would total approximately $1,690 in pre-tax charges. Should, however, the March 31, 1998 judgment of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in favor of the Team be reinstated, we could be entitled to receive payment of approximately $1,144, including interest from June 26, 1991. Employment and Benefits Litigation On March 2, 2006, we were served with a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, alleging that hiring decisions made by Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. (Spirit) near the time of our sale of the Wichita facility were tainted by age discrimination, violated Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), violated our collective bargaining agreements, and constituted retaliation. The case is brought as a class action on behalf of individuals not hired by Spirit. While we believe that Spirit has an obligation to indemnify Boeing for claims relating to the 2005 sales transaction, Spirit has refused to indemnify Boeing for all claims arising from employment activity prior to January 1, 2005. On June 4, 2008, claims by individuals who filed consents to join the Age Discrimination Employment Act collective action and were terminated by Boeing prior to January 1, 2005 were dismissed by stipulated order. On June 15, 2009, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking class certification for certain former Boeing employees at the Wichita, Tulsa and McAlester facilities over the age of 40 who were laid off between January 1, 2005 and July 1, 2005, and were not hired by Spirit on June 17, 2005. On July 31, 2009, Boeing filed motions opposing class certification and seeking dismissal of the ERISA and breach of contract claims. On August 14, 2009, Boeing filed a motion seeking dismissal, or in the alternative, decertification of the age claims. Plaintiffs reply brief on certification of ERISA 510 and Labor-Management Relations Act (LMRA) 301 classes was filed on August 28, 2009. Plaintiffs response to Defendants motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs ERISA 510 and LMRA 301 claims was filed on September 11, 2009. These motions are fully briefed and are pending before the court. A second alleged class action involving our sale of the Wichita facility to Spirit was filed on February 21, 2007, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas. The case is also brought under ERISA, and, in general, claims that we have not properly provided benefits to certain categories of former employees affected by the sale . On May 22, 2008, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint and on June 3, 2008, filed a motion to certify a class. On July 14, 2008, the court granted class certification for the purpose of adjudicating liability for the class of employees who went to work for Spirit, and deferred class certification motions for the class of employees who did not go to work for Spirit. A Memorandum and Order on November 3, 2009 resolves discovery disputes and discovery continues for both groups of employees. On September 13, 2006, two UAW Local 1069 retirees filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee alleging that recently announced changes to medical plans for retirees of UAW Local 1069 constituted a breach of collective bargaining agreements under 301 of the LMRA and 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA. On September 15, 2006, we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the International UAW and two retiree medical plan participants seeking a declaratory judgment confirming that we have the legal right to make changes to these medical benefits. On June 4, 2007, the Middle District of Tennessee ordered that its case be transferred to the Northern District of Illinois. The two cases were consolidated on September 24, 2007. On January 17, 2008, the court granted the UAWs motion to amend the complaint to drop the retirees claim for vested lifetime benefits based on successive collective bargaining agreements and  instead allege that the current collective bargaining agreement is the sole alleged source of rights to retiree medical benefits. Both parties filed Motions for Class Certification on November 16, 2007 and filed briefs on class certification on February 28, 2008. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on May 27, 2008. On September 30, 2008, the court certified a class of retirees for all claims. On September 9, 2009, the court granted Boeings motion and ruled that the retiree medical benefits were not vested lifetime benefits and that the 2006 changes to benefits did not violate the 2005 collective bargaining agreement. On October 8, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. On October 13, 2006, we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. Plaintiffs, seeking to represent a class of similarly situated participants and beneficiaries in the Boeing Company Voluntary Investment Plan (the VIP Plan), alleged that fees and expenses incurred by the VIP Plan were and are unreasonable and excessive, not incurred solely for the benefit of the VIP Plan and its participants, and were undisclosed to participants. The plaintiffs further alleged that defendants breached their fiduciary duties in violation of 502(a)(2) of ERISA, and sought injunctive and equitable relief pursuant to 502(a)(3) of ERISA. Plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class, which we opposed. On December 14, 2007, the court granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint, which complaint added our Employee Benefits Investment Committee as a defendant and included new allegations regarding alleged breach of fiduciary duty. The stay of proceedings entered by the court on September 10, 2007, pending resolution by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit of Lively v. Dynegy, Inc. , was lifted on April 3, 2008, after notification that the Lively case had settled. On April 16, 2008, plaintiffs sought leave to file a second amended complaint, which we opposed, which would add investment performance allegations. On August 22, 2008, the court granted plaintiffs leave to file their second amended complaint. On September 29, 2008, the court granted plaintiffs motion to certify the class of current, past and future participants or beneficiaries in the VIP Plan. On September 9, 2008, we filed a motion for summary judgment to dismiss claims arising prior to September 27, 2000 based on the ERISA statute of limitations. On October 14, 2008, we filed a petition for leave to appeal the class certification order to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. On January 15, 2009, we filed a motion seeking dismissal of all claims as a matter of law. On August 10, 2009, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted Boeings motion for leave to appeal the class certification order. The district court entered a stay of proceedings in the trial court pending resolution of the class certification appeal. On December 29, 2009, the district court lifted on plaintiffs motion the stay of proceedings previously entered. Boeing responded by filing an Application for Stay Pending Appeal with the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals on January 7, 2010. BSSI/ICO Litigation On August 16, 2004, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. (BSSI) filed a complaint for declaratory relief against ICO Global Communications (Operations), Ltd. (ICO) in Los Angeles County Superior Court seeking a declaration that ICOs prior termination of two contracts for convenience extinguished all claims between the parties. On September 16, 2004, ICO filed a cross - complaint alleging breach of contract, economic duress, fraud, unfair competition, and other claims. ICO added The Boeing Company as a defendant in October 2005 to some of these claims and also sued it for interference with contract and misappropriation of trade secrets. On January 13, 2006, BSSI filed a cross-complaint against ICO, ICO Global Communications (Holdings) Limited (ICO Holdings), ICOs parent, and Eagle River Investments, LLC, parent of both ICO and ICO Holdings, alleging fraud and other claims. The trial commenced on June 19, 2008, with ICO seeking to recover approximately $2,000 in damages, including all monies paid to BSSI and Boeing Launch Services, plus punitive damages and other unspecified damages and relief.  On October 21, 2008, the jury returned a verdict awarding ICO compensatory damages of $371 plus interest, based upon findings of contract breach, fraud and interference with contract. On October 31, 2008, the jury awarded ICO punitive damages of $236. On January 2, 2009, the court entered judgment for ICO in the amount of $631 which included $24 in prejudgment interest. On February 26, 2009 the trial court granted in part and denied in part post-trial motions we filed seeking to set aside the verdict. As a result, on March 3, 2009, the court entered an amended judgment for ICO in the amount of $604, which included $371 in compensatory damages, $207 in punitive damages and $26 in prejudgment interest. Post-judgment interest will accrue on the judgment at the rate of 10% per year (simple interest) from January 2, 2009. We filed a notice of appeal and ICO filed a notice of cross-appeal in March 2009. Our opening brief for the appeal was filed on October 27, 2009. No date has been set for argument. We believe that we have substantial arguments on appeal, which we intend to pursue vigorously. BSSI/Telesat Canada On November 9, 2006, Telesat Canada (Telesat) and a group of its insurers served BSSI with an arbitration demand alleging breach of contract, gross negligence and willful misconduct in connection with the constructive total loss of Anik F1, a model 702 satellite manufactured by BSSI. Telesat and its insurers initially sought over $385 in damages and $10 in lost profits, but recently revised their demand to $263. BSSI has asserted a counterclaim against Telesat for $6 in unpaid performance incentive payments and also a $180 contingent counterclaim on the theory that any ultimate award to reimburse the insurers for their payments to Telesat could only result from Telesats breach of its contractual obligation to obtain a full waiver of subrogation rights barring recourse against BSSI. We believe that the claims asserted by Telesat and its insurers lack merit, but we have notified our insurance carriers of the demand. The arbitration has been stayed pending an application by Telesat to the Ontario Superior Court on a preliminary issue. The arbitration hearing date has been vacated. On April 26, 2007, a group of our insurers filed a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court of Cook County asserting certain defenses to coverage and requesting a declaration of their obligation under our insurance and reinsurance policies relating to the Telesat Anik F1 arbitration. On June 12, 2008, the court granted the insurers motion for summary judgment, concluding that our insurance policy excluded the kinds of losses alleged by Telesat. On January 16, 2009, the court granted Boeings motion for reconsideration, ruling in favor of Boeing to require the insurers to provide insurance coverage to defend the claim. Civil Securities Litigation Plaintiff shareholders have filed a putative securities fraud class action against The Boeing Company and two of our senior executives. This lawsuit arises from our June 2009 announcement that the first flight of the 787 Dreamliner would be postponed due to a need to reinforce an area within the side-of-body section of the aircraft. Plaintiffs contend that we were aware before June 2009 that the first flight could not take place as scheduled due to issues with the side-of-body section of the aircraft, and that our determination not to announce this delay earlier resulted in an artificial inflation of our stock price for a multi-week period in May and June 2009. Plaintiffs complaint was filed in November 2009. No briefing or discovery has yet taken place. We believe the allegations are without merit and intend to contest the case vigorously. In addition, plaintiff shareholders have filed three similar shareholder derivative lawsuits concerning the flight schedule for the 787 Dreamliner that closely tracks the allegations in the putative class action lawsuit. No briefing or discovery has yet taken place. We believe the allegations are without merit and intend to contest the case vigorously.  Note 21  Segment Information We operate in five principal segments: Commercial Airplanes; Boeing Military Aircraft, Network  Space Systems, and Global Services  Support, collectively BDS; and BCC. All other activities fall within the Other segment, principally made up of Engineering, Operations  Technology and our Shared Services Group. See page 45 for Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note. Our Commercial Airplanes operation principally involves development, production and marketing of commercial jet aircraft and providing related support services, principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Boeing Company Chicago, Illinois We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2. The financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 8, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. / S / D ELOITTE  T OUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois February 8, 2010  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Boeing Company Chicago, Illinois We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 of the Company and our report dated February 8, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule. / S / D ELOITTE  T OUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois February 8, 2010  ", "9A": " Item 9A.

Boeing Capital Corporation Segment In the commercial aircraft market, BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Commercial Airplanes customers. In the space and defense markets, BCC primarily arranges and structures financing solutions for our BDS government customers. BCCs portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases, finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and investments. Financial and Other Business Information See page 55 for the Summary of Business Segment Data and Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information, including revenues and earnings from operations, for each of our business segments. Intellectual Property We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented  research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. Non-U.S. Revenues See Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding non-U.S. revenues. Research and Development Research and development expenditures involve experimentation, design, development and related test activities for defense systems, new and derivative jet aircraft including both commercial and military, advanced space and other company-sponsored product development. These are expensed as incurred including amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on U.S. government contracts. Our total research and development expense amounted to $4.1 billion, $6.5 billion and $3.8 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2008 amount is net of 787-related research and development cost sharing payments from suppliers of $50 million. Research and development expense in 2009 included $2.7 billion of production costs related to the first three flight test 787 aircraft that cannot be sold due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications that would be made to the aircraft. Research and development costs also include bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services, as well as costs incurred in excess of amounts estimated to be recoverable under cost-sharing research and development agreements. Bid and proposal costs were $355 million, $343 million and $330 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Research and development highlights for each of the major business segments are discussed in more detail in Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition on pages 22  38. Employees Total workforce level at December 31, 2010 was 160,500. As of December 31, 2010, our principal collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions: ##TABLE_START Union  Percent of our Employees Represented  Status of the Agreements with the Union The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM)  19%  We have two major agreements; one expiring in September of 2012 and one in January of 2015. The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA)  13%  We have two major agreements expiring in October of 2012. The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW)  2%  We have two major agreements; one expiring in October of 2014 and one in February of 2015. ##TABLE_END  Competition The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as Airbus, Embraer and Bombardier, and other entrants from Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with greater value products, services, and support. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity. BDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company and General Dynamics Corporation. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), the parent of Airbus, continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In addition, certain of our competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2011 with many international firms pursuing announced intentions of increasing their U.S. presence. Regulatory Matters Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our international markets. U.S. Government Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default, based on our failure to meet specified performance measurements. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and can require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default. Commercial Aircraft. In the United States, our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Internationally, similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Joint Aviation Authorities. Environmental. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if more stringent clean-up standards are imposed, additional contamination is discovered and/or clean-up costs are higher than estimated.  A Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site, the statutory framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. International. Our international sales are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, investment, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. International sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks. Raw Materials We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take one year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of companies. Suppliers We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and program/contract profitability, thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. We are also dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices. A number of our suppliers have made assertions for higher prices or other contractual compensation relief which could affect program/contract profitability. Seasonality No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, except as required by law. ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report. Our commercial aircraft business depends heavily on commercial airlines and our suppliers, and is subject to unique risks. Our ability to deliver aircraft on time depends on a variety of factors, which are subject to unique risks. Our ability to deliver aircraft on schedule is dependent upon a variety of factors, including execution of internal performance plans, availability of raw materials (such as aluminum, titanium and composites) and internally and supplier produced parts and structures, conversion of raw materials into parts and assemblies, performance of suppliers and subcontractors and regulatory certification. The failure of any or all of these factors could result in significant out-of-sequence work and disrupted process flows adversely affecting production schedules and program/contract profitability, the latter through increased costs as well as possible customer and/or supplier claims or assertions. In addition, the introduction of new commercial aircraft programs and major derivative aircraft involves increased risk associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. Market conditions have a significant impact on our ability to sell aircraft into the future. The worldwide market for commercial jet aircraft is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability, both in developed and emerging countries. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline industry profitability, world trade policies, availability of financing, government-to-government relations, terrorism, disease outbreaks, environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operations, technological changes and price and other competitive factors. Our commercial aircraft customers may request to cancel, modify or reschedule orders. We generally make sales under aircraft purchase agreements that may, for a variety of reasons, become the subject of cancellation, modification or rescheduling. Changes in the economic environment and the financial condition of the airline industry and our customers could result in customer requests to reschedule or cancel contractual orders. Our contracts have specific provisions relating to schedule and performance and failure to deliver airplanes in accordance with such provisions could result in cancellations and/or claims for compensation. Any such cancellations, modification, rescheduling or claims could significantly reduce our backlog, revenues, profitability and cash flows.  Commercial aircraft pricing is based in part on escalation formulas established well in advance of delivery and is therefore subject to factors beyond our control. Price escalation provisions in our sales contracts are designed to adjust for economic fluctuations between the contract date and aircraft delivery, a period which can span many years. As a result, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by a price escalation formula using pre-defined factors. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of major commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will purchase additional products or services from us after our contract with the customer ends. In addition, fleet decisions, consolidation or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers. Our commercial aircraft production rates could change. Production rate reductions could cause us to incur disruption and other costs and result in infrastructure costs being allocated to a smaller quantity of airplanes, all of which could reduce our profitability. The introduction of a new aircraft program and/or higher orders for our aircraft could lead to production rate increases in order to meet the delivery schedules. Failure to successfully implement any production rate changes could lead to extended delivery commitments, and depending on the length of delay in meeting delivery commitments, additional costs and customers rescheduling their deliveries or terminating their related contract with us. The profitability of our commercial aircraft development programs depends upon a variety of factors, which are subject to unique risks. We are currently engaged in the demanding flight testing and certification phases of program development on both the 787-8 and 747-8 Freighter aircraft. These airplanes have highly complex designs, utilize exotic materials and require extensive coordination and integration with supplier partners. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, meet contractual performance requirements and achieve program profitability is subject to significant risks. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, the inability to efficiently and cost-effectively incorporate design changes into production aircraft, and aircraft performance issues, could result in additional expenses or lower program revenues. For example, in 2009 we determined that three of the six 787 flight test aircraft could not be sold due to the inordinate amount of work that would be required to prepare the aircraft for sale. As a result, we reclassified $2.7 billion from inventory to research and development expense. If we determine that one or more of the other flight test aircraft will not be sold, we may incur additional charges. In addition, flight testing and certification delays or supplier or other operational challenges that impact our ability to achieve our targeted production rates may result in aircraft delivery delays and higher costs to complete. For example, on January 18, 2011, we announced that the expected date of first delivery of our 787 Dreamliner had been moved to the third quarter of 2011 due to a combination of flight testing delays, supplier challenges and other issues common to commercial aircraft development programs. Our inability to deliver aircraft to our customers in a timely manner could result in order cancellations or other significant financial exposures, or could otherwise reduce the profitability of our Commercial Airplanes business. We continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impact of schedule changes and otherwise to ensure that our aircraft meet customer expectations. Looking beyond entry into service for the 787-8 and 747-8 Freighter, we continue to work toward improving production efficiencies and supplier performance, incorporating design changes into aircraft  that have already been produced, improving aircraft performance, successfully implementing planned increases in production rates and introducing the 787-9 and 747-8 Intercontinental airplanes. For example, we are increasing production capacity in Everett and Charleston and working closely with our suppliers to support 787 production rate increases. If assembly line ramp-up efforts are delayed or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the rates necessary to achieve our planned rate increases, we may be unable to meet delivery targets and the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer. Management uses its best judgment to estimate the cost to perform the work, the price we will eventually be paid and the number of units to include in the initial accounting quantity. Changes to estimates of the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, costs of derivative aircraft, customer negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and certification issues could affect margins or result in reach-forward losses. The cumulative impact of production challenges, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts has resulted in a reach-forward loss on the 747 program and continues to place significant pressure on revenues, costs and the profitability of the 787 program. Our BDS business could be adversely affected by changing acquisition priorities of the U.S. government, particularly the Department of Defense, including an increased emphasis on affordability. The U.S. government participates in an increasingly wide variety of operations, including homeland defense, natural disasters, stabilization efforts, counterinsurgency and counterterrorism, that employ our products and services. The U.S. government, primarily operating through the U.S. DoD, continues to adjust its funding priorities in response to this changing threat environment. In addition, defense funding currently faces pressures due to the overall economic environment and competing budget priorities. Due to these pressures, we expect the total U.S. DoD budget growth rate to remain stable or even decline slightly over the next several years. Any reduction in the growth rate or overall levels of U.S. DoD spending or cancellations or delays impacting existing contracts could have a significant impact on the operating results of our BDS business. We also expect that the U.S. DoD will continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. These initiatives will require us and our competitors to focus increasingly on long-term cost competitiveness and affordability when responding to proposals and/or pursuing development programs. If the priorities of the U.S. government change and/or we are unable to meet affordability targets, our BDS revenues and profitability could be negatively impacted. We depend heavily on U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks. In 2010, 43% of our revenues were derived from U.S. government contracts. In addition to normal business risks, our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique risks, some of which are beyond our control. The funding of U.S. government programs is subject to congressional appropriations . Many of the U.S. government programs in which we participate may last several years; however, these programs are normally funded annually. Changes in military strategy and priorities may affect our future procurement opportunities and existing programs. Long-term government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation, delay or restructure, if appropriations for subsequent performance periods are not made. The termination or reduction of funding for existing or new U.S. government programs could result in a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and financial position. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate our contracts. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and at its convenience  upon payment for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. Modification, curtailment or termination of one or more of our major programs or contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our contract costs are subject to audits by U.S. government agencies . U.S. government representatives may audit the costs we incur on our U.S. government contracts, including allocated indirect costs. Such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. We have recorded contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize upon final audit. However, we do not know the outcome of any future audits and adjustments and we may be required to reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. If any audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. Our business is subject to potential U.S. government inquiries and investigations. We are sometimes subject to certain U.S. government inquiries and investigations due to our participation in government contracts. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our U.S. government business is also subject to specific procurement regulations and other requirements. These requirements, although customary in U.S. government contracts, increase our performance and compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future, reducing our margins, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition. Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or debarment, or withholding of revenue and profit, for cause, from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time and could have a negative effect on our reputation and ability to secure future U.S. government contracts. We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns. Approximately 55% of BDS revenues are generated from fixed-price contracts. While firm fixed price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance. Fixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. If we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, our sales price could be reduced. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which would adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include AEWC, KC-767 International Tanker, P-8I and commercial and military satellites. We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks. Approximately 45% of BDS revenues are generated from cost-type contracting arrangements. Some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over  extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Programs whose contracts are primarily cost-type include GMD, BCTM, P-8A Poseidon, Proprietary programs, JTRS, FAB-T and the EA-18G Growler. We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks. Contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit payments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite does not perform to specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance. The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees we ultimately expect to realize is recognized as revenue in the construction period. If the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criteria, customers will not be obligated to continue making in-orbit payments and/or we may be required to provide refunds to the customer and incur significant charges. We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results. Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. Under program accounting, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Such estimates are reconsidered throughout the life of our programs. Changes in underlying assumptions, supplier performance, circumstances or estimates concerning the selection of the accounting quantity or changes in market conditions, along with a failure to realize predicted costs, may adversely affect future financial performance. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under Managements Discussion and AnalysisCritical Accounting PoliciesContract Accounting/Program Accounting on pages 42 - 44 and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 56 - 57 of this Form 10-K.  Competition within our markets may reduce our future contracts and sales. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasing competition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers and service providers in one or more of our market segments. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation and new priorities, including long-term cost competitiveness, of our U.S. DoD customer will intensify competition for many of our products and services. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not result in reduced revenues and market share. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries. In 2010, sales to non-U.S. customers accounted for 41% of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including: ##TABLE_START   changes in regulatory requirements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   domestic and international government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   fluctuations in international currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   volatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   imposition of taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over various countries; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   economic and geopolitical developments and conditions. ##TABLE_END While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future. The outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could result in significant monetary payments and have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations. We are involved in a number of litigation matters. These claims may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other  things, to our business relationships with the U.S government, the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our ownership of certain property. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could result in significant monetary payments (including possible environmental remediation costs) and a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results. A significant portion of our and Boeing Capital Corporations customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers based in the United States, and in certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks. A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions, particularly in the United States. Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably Boeing 717 aircraft. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties, or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position could be materially adversely affected. We may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. If we were called upon to fund all outstanding financing commitments, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance or outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures. As part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses, form joint ventures/strategic alliances and divest operations. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends, in part, upon the integration between the businesses involved, the performance of the underlying products, capabilities or technologies and the management of the transacted operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated performance issues, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our results of operations or financial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful. Divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures. We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. While we maintain insurance for certain risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. government, insurance cannot be obtained to protect against all risks and liabilities. It is  therefore possible that the amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft technologies, missile systems, border security systems, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While many of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurance coverage we are able to maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims or liabilities. Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses. Our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or services provided to customers, and could impact our sales, increase our expenses or adversely affect our reputation or our stock price. Some of our and our suppliers' workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages. Approximately 57,400 employees, which constitute 36% of our total workforce, are union represented as of December 31, 2010. We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BMA program production and we may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 14 different U.S. labor organizations and 7 different non-U.S. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions requirements without impacting our financial condition. The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations. Significant changes in discount rates, actual investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect our earnings, equity, and pension contributions in future periods. Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. The most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension or other postretirement income or expense for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and expected future medical inflation. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to Shareholders equity. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see Managements Discussion and AnalysisCritical Accounting PoliciesPostretirement Plans on pages 4647 of this Form 10-K. Although GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or common stock we would contribute to the pension or other postretirement plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and discretionary contributions to improve the plans funded status.  Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or past manufacturing operations or the operations of companies we have acquired. In other cases, we may become subject to such costs due to an indemnification agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental liabilities. In addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation requirements could result in additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. ", "1B": " Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not Applicable.

It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and the discovery of additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios which include highest cost estimates for all remediation sites based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our reasonably possible highest cost estimate for all remediation sites exceeded our recorded liabilities by $957 and $948. Product Warranties The following table summarizes product warranty activity recorded for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. ##TABLE_START    2010   2009  Beginning balance  January 1  $ 999   $ 959  Additions for current year deliveries   141    167  Reductions for payments made   (234 )   (237 ) Changes in estimates   170    110  Ending balance  December 31  $ 1,076   $ 999    ##TABLE_END Discontinued Operations As part of the 2004 purchase and sale agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation related to the sale of Boeing Capital Corporations (BCC) Commercial Financial Services business, BCC is involved in a loss sharing arrangement for losses on transferred portfolio assets, such as asset sales, provisions for loss or asset impairment charges offset by gains from asset sales. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our maximum future cash exposure to losses associated with the loss sharing arrangement was $232 and $234 and our accrued liability under the loss sharing arrangement was $82 and $77. Commercial Aircraft Commitments In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into specified-price trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. The total contractual trade-in value was $295 and $427 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. We anticipate that a significant portion of these commitments will not be exercised by customers. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is continually assessed, taking into consideration the current economic environment. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer. The estimated fair value of trade-in aircraft related to probable contractual trade-in commitments was $30 and $34 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Trade-in commitment agreements have expiration dates from 2011 through 2023.  Future Lease Commitments As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, future lease commitments on aircraft and other commitments not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position totaled $17 and $159. These lease commitments extend through 2015, and our intent is to recover these lease commitments through sublease arrangements. As of December 31, 2010, the future lease commitments on aircraft for each of the next five years were as follows: $3 in 2011, $3 in 2012, $3 in 2013, $3 in 2014, and $3 in 2015. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, Other accrued liabilities included $12 and $14 attributable to adverse commitments under these lease arrangements. Financing Commitments Financing commitments totaled $9,865 and $10,409 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. We anticipate that a significant portion of these commitments will not be exercised by the customers as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. We have entered into standby letters of credit agreements and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $7,599 and $7,052 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. In connection with the formation of ULA, we and Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) each committed to provide up to $200 to support its working capital requirements through December 1, 2011. ULA did not request any funds under the commitment as of December 31, 2010. We and Lockheed have also each committed to provide ULA with up to $232 of additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. See Note 7. C-17 At December 31, 2010, our backlog included 6 C-17 aircraft currently under contract with the U.S. Air Force (USAF) as well as international orders for 6 C-17 aircraft. At December 31, 2010, we have approximately $620 of inventory expenditures and potential termination liabilities to suppliers associated primarily with 10 aircraft funded in the Fiscal Year 2010 (FY10) Defense Appropriations Act which are not currently under contract. The Presidents Fiscal Year 2011 budget announced during the first quarter of 2010 did not include any additional C-17 aircraft. During the first quarter of 2010 we announced plans to reduce the production rate from 15 per year to 10 per year and expect the transition to be complete by mid-2011. The lower production rate is intended to bridge the gap between existing orders and potential future orders. Should additional orders not materialize, it is reasonably possible that we will decide in 2011 to end production of the C-17 at a future date. We are still evaluating the full financial impact of a potential production shut-down, including any recovery that would be available from the U.S. government. Such recovery from the U.S. government would not include the costs incurred by us resulting from our direction to suppliers to begin working on aircraft beyond those currently under contract with the USAF. Company Owned Life Insurance McDonnell Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life insurance policies with a cash surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of  December 31, 2010 and 2009, the cash surrender value was $381 and $360 and the total loans were $363 and $337. As we have the right to offset the loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Note 12  Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees. Third-Party Guarantees The following tables provide quantitative data regarding our third-party guarantees. The maximum potential payments represent a worst-case scenario, and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset our payments under guarantees. ##TABLE_START    Maximum Potential Payments   Estimated Proceeds from Collateral/ Recourse   Carrying Amount of Liabilities (1)  December 31,  2010   2009   2010   2009   2010   2009  Contingent repurchase commitments  $ 3,782   $ 3,958   $ 3,759   $ 3,940   $ 7   $ 7  Indemnifications to ULA:       Contributed Delta program launch inventory   187    277      Contract pricing   261    348      7    7  Other Delta contracts   83    57      16    16  Other credit guarantees   71    119    63    109    6    2  Residual value guarantees   29    51    21    44    6    10    ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Amounts included in Other accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_END Contingent Repurchase Commitments We have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers in conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft. Under these commitments, we agreed to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and the subsequent exercise by the customer of its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us. The repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase commitments is generally lower than the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated Proceeds from Collateral/Recourse in the tables above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date. Indemnifications to ULA We agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 of Boeing Delta launch program inventory included in contributed assets plus $1,860 of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021. Since inception, ULA has consumed $1,201 of inventory that was contributed by us. ULA has made advance payments of $420 to us and we have recorded revenues and cost of sales of $166 under the inventory supply agreement through December 31, 2010. ULA is continuing to assess the future of the Delta II program beyond what is currently on contract. In the event ULA is unable to sell additional Delta II inventory, our earnings could be reduced by up to $70.  We agreed to indemnify ULA against potential losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the USAF for four satellite missions. We believe ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing. In December 2008, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value for two satellite missions. In March 2009, the USAF issued a denial of that claim and in June 2009, ULA filed an appeal. During 2009, the USAF exercised its option for a third satellite mission. During the third quarter of 2010, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value of the third mission. The USAF did not exercise an option for a fourth mission prior to expiration. If ULA is unsuccessful in obtaining additional pricing, we may be responsible for a portion of the shortfall and may record up to $283 in pre-tax losses associated with the three missions, representing up to $261 for the indemnification payment and up to $22 for our portion of additional contract losses incurred by ULA. Other Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees, principally to facilitate the sale and/or financing of commercial aircraft. Under these arrangements, we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that lease or loan payments are not made by the original lessee or debtor or certain specified services are not performed. A substantial portion of these guarantees has been extended on behalf of original lessees or debtors with less than investment-grade credit. Our commercial aircraft credit guarantees are collateralized by the underlying commercial aircraft and certain other assets. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire within the next ten years. Residual Value Guarantees We have issued various residual value guarantees principally to facilitate the sale and financing of certain commercial aircraft. Under these guarantees, we are obligated to make payments to the guaranteed party if the related aircraft or equipment fair values fall below a specified amount at a future time. These obligations are collateralized principally by the underlying commercial aircraft and expire within the next eight years. Other Indemnifications In conjunction with our sales of the Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and the sale of our Commercial Airplanes facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma in 2005, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental contamination and certain other items. As it is impossible to assess whether there will be damages in the future or the amounts thereof (if any), we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities. Therefore, no liability has been recorded. There have been no claims submitted to date. Industrial Revenue Bonds Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRBs) issued by the City of Wichita are used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property at our Wichita site. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a ten-year property tax abatement and a sales tax exemption from the Kansas Department of Revenue. We record the property on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, along with a capital lease obligation to repay the proceeds of the IRB. We have also purchased the IRBs and therefore are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the property purchased with the IRB proceeds. The capital lease obligation and IRB asset are recorded net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the net assets associated with the City of Wichita IRBs were $822 and $856.  Note 13  Debt Total debt interest incurred, including amounts capitalized, was $729, $610 and $520 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest expense recorded by BCC is reflected as a separate line item on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and is included in earnings from operations. Total Company interest payments were $670, $502 and $493 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We have $4,376 currently available under credit line agreements, of which $2,000 is a five-year credit facility expiring in November 2012 and $ 2,376 is a 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in November 2011. Both the five-year and 364-day credit facilities have a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration dates. We have given BCC exclusive access to $1,500 under these arrangements. We continue to be in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt or credit facility agreements, including those at BCC. Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009     Consolidated Total   BCC Only   Consolidated Total   BCC Only  Unsecured debt securities  $ 785   $ 785   $ 644   $ 644  Non-recourse debt and notes   79    6    24    6  Capital lease obligations   62    10    14    9  Other notes   22        25      Total  $ 948   $ 801   $ 707   $ 659    ##TABLE_END Debt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009  Boeing Capital Corporation debt:   Unsecured debt securities   1.53%  7.58% due through 2023  $ 3,339   $ 3,952  Non-recourse debt and notes   1.37%  5.79% notes due through 2013   55    61  Capital lease obligations   0.92% due through 2015   52    62  Boeing Capital Corporation debt subtotal  $ 3,446   $ 4,075  Other Boeing debt:   Unsecured debentures and notes   1.88%  5.00% due through 2020  $ 3,376   $ 3,372  5.88%  6.88% due through 2043   2,988    2,987  7.25%  9.75% due through 2043   1,991    1,990  Non-recourse debt and notes   Enhanced equipment trust   342    360  Capital lease obligations due through 2017   135    14  Other notes   143    126  Other Boeing debt subtotal  $ 8,975   $ 8,849  Total debt  $ 12,421   $ 12,924    ##TABLE_END  Other Boeing debt includes $300 bearing an interest rate of 7.95% due August 15, 2024 that may be redeemed at the holders option on August 15, 2012. At December 31, 2010, $107 of BCC debt was collateralized by portfolio assets and underlying equipment totaling $186. The debt consists of the 0.92% to 5.79% notes due through 2015. Scheduled principal payments for debt and capital lease obligations for the next five years are as follows: ##TABLE_START    2011   2012   2013   2014   2015  Boeing Capital Corporation  $ 798   $ 878   $ 652   $ 526   $ 16  Other Boeing   141    1,420    657    770    821  Total  $ 939   $ 2,298   $ 1,309   $ 1,296   $ 837    ##TABLE_END Note 14  Postretirement Plans Almost all of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans, with the exception of all nonunion and some union employees hired after December 31, 2008. We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans participants, and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long term with the growth of obligations for future benefit payments. We also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for approximately half those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered by most United Auto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage. The funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). We have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Pension plan assets, net, and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in Other accrued liabilities. The components of net periodic benefit cost are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Pension   Other Postretirement Benefits  Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008   2010   2009   2008  Service cost  $ 1,176   $ 1,090   $ 952   $ 121   $ 132   $ 126  Interest cost   3,002    2,964    2,823    404    466    459  Expected return on plan assets   (3,850 )   (3,738 )   (3,811 )   (6 )   (5 )   (8 ) Amortization of prior service costs   248    242    206    (78 )   (90 )   (93 ) Recognized net actuarial loss   777    650    392    56    92    86  Settlement/curtailment/transfer loss   14    13                  Net periodic benefit cost  $ 1,367   $ 1,221   $ 562   $ 497   $ 595   $ 570    Net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations  $ 1,101   $ 879   $ 696   $ 480   $ 615   $ 507    ##TABLE_END  A portion of net periodic benefit cost is allocated to production as product costs and may remain in inventory at the end of each reporting period. The following tables show changes in the benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status of both pensions and OPB for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Benefit obligation balances presented below reflect the PBO for our pension plans, and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations (APBO) for our OPB plans. ##TABLE_START    Pension   Other Postretirement Benefits     2010   2009   2010   2009  Change in benefit obligation     Beginning balance  $ 52,166   $ 49,017   $ 7,576   $ 7,859  Service cost   1,176    1,090    121    132  Interest cost   3,002    2,964    404    466  Plan participants contributions   9    9    Amendments   142    143    (130 )   (18 ) Actuarial (gain)/loss   5,243    1,445    1,061    (374 ) Settlement/curtailment/acquisitions/ dispositions, net   (93 )   (68 )   32   Gross benefits paid   (2,567 )   (2,515 )   (555 )   (541 ) Medicare Part D subsidy     31    30  Exchange rate adjustment   28    81    6    22  Ending balance  $ 59,106   $ 52,166   $ 8,546   $ 7,576    Change in plan assets     Beginning balance at fair value  $ 45,810   $ 40,597   $ 89   $ 79  Actual return on plan assets   5,979    6,074    11    13  Company contribution   35    1,582    15    24  Plan participants contributions   9    9    2    2  Settlement/curtailment/acquisitions/ dispositions, net   (98 )   (67 )    (1 ) Benefits paid   (2,507 )   (2,459 )   (19 )   (28 ) Exchange rate adjustment   24    74          Ending balance at fair value  $ 49,252   $ 45,810   $ 98   $ 89    Amounts recognized in statement of financial position at December 31 consist of:     Pension plan assets, net  $ 6   $ 16    Other accrued liabilities   (60 )   (57 )  $ (423 )  $ (438 ) Accrued retiree health care     (8,025 )   (7,049 ) Accrued pension plan liability, net   (9,800 )   (6,315 )         Net amount recognized  $ (9,854 )  $ (6,356 )  $ (8,448 )  $ (7,487 )   ##TABLE_END Amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Pensions   Other Postretirement Benefits     2010   2009   2010   2009  Net actuarial loss  $ 19,343   $ 17,012   $ 2,148   $ 1,197  Prior service cost/(credit)   1,225    1,331    (384 )   (332 ) Total recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss  $ 20,568   $ 18,343   $ 1,764   $ 865    ##TABLE_END  The estimated amount that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during the year ended December 31, 2011 is as follows: ##TABLE_START    Pensions   Other Postretirement Benefits  Recognized net actuarial loss  $ 1,252   $ 132  Amortization of prior service costs   250    (96 ) Total  $ 1,502   $ 36    ##TABLE_END The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for all pension plans was $53,513 and $47,549 at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Key information for our plans with ABO in excess of plan assets as of December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009  Projected benefit obligation  $ 58,772   $ 26,141  Accumulated benefit obligation   53,202    24,227  Fair value of plan assets   48,926    22,205    ##TABLE_END The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 reduced our APBO by $60 and $497 at December 31, 2010 and 2009. These reductions/actuarial gains are amortized over the expected average future service of current employees. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 increased our APBO by $300 at December 31, 2010. This includes the impact of the excise tax on high cost health plans scheduled to become payable beginning in 2018. This increase is recognized as an actuarial loss and is amortized over the expected future service of current employees. Assumptions The following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31 of each year and the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year. ##TABLE_START December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Discount rate:    Pension   5.30 %   5.80 %   6.10 % Other postretirement benefits   4.90 %   5.40 %   6.00 % Expected return on plan assets   7.75 %   8.00 %   8.00 % Rate of compensation increase   5.20 %   5.50 %   5.50 %   ##TABLE_END The discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high quality bonds that are rated as Aa or better by Moodys as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yields developed from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. A portfolio of about 400 bonds is used to construct the yield curve. Since corporate bond yields are generally not available at maturities beyond 30 years, it is assumed that spot rates will remain level beyond that 30-year point. The present value of each plans benefits is calculated by applying the spot/discount rates to projected benefit cash flows. All bonds are U.S. issues, with a minimum outstanding of $50.  The pension funds expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the upcoming plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five-year moving average of plan assets. As of December 31, 2010, the MRVA is approximately $450 greater than the fair market value of assets. Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows: ##TABLE_START December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Health care cost trend rate assumed next year   7.50 %   7.00 %   7.50 % Ultimate trend rate   5.00 %   5.00 %   5.00 % Year that trend reached ultimate rate   2018    2014    2014    ##TABLE_END Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. To determine the health care cost trend rates we look at a combination of information including ongoing claims cost monitoring, annual statistical analyses of claims data, reconciliation of forecast claims against actual claims, review of trend assumptions of other plan sponsors and national health trends, and adjustments for plan design changes, workforce changes, and changes in plan participant behavior. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect: ##TABLE_START    Increase   Decrease  Effect on total of service and interest cost  $ 51   $ (44 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation   742    (654 )   ##TABLE_END Plan Assets Investment Strategy The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive, total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified. We update our long-term, strategic asset allocations every three-to-five years. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investment benchmarks for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions (such as private equity and real estate), and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced on a monthly basis.  The actual allocations for the pension assets at December 31 and target allocations by asset class, are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Percentage of Plan Assets   Target Allocations  Asset Class  2010   2009   2010   2009  Fixed income   49 %   50 %   45 %   45 % Global equity   33    34    28    28  Private equity   5    5    6    6  Real estate and real assets   5    4    10    10  Global strategies   4    4    5    5  Hedge funds   4    3    6    6  Total   100 %   100 %   100 %   100 %   ##TABLE_END Fixed income securities are invested broadly and primarily in long duration instruments. Global equity securities are invested broadly in U.S. and non-U.S. companies which are in various industries and countries and through a range of market capitalizations. Real estate and real assets include global private investments and publicly traded investments (such as REITs in the case of real estate). Real estate includes but is not limited to investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include but are not limited to investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber) and infrastructure. Private equity investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) and fund-of-funds that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies. Global strategies seek to capitalize on inefficiencies identified across different asset classes or markets, primarily using long-short positions in derivatives and physical securities. Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to event driven, relative value, long-short and market neutral. A well-diversified number of hedge funds are held. Investment managers are retained for explicit investment roles specified by contractual investment guidelines. Certain investment managers are authorized to invest in derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve the desired market exposure of a security or an index, transfer value-added performance between asset classes, achieve the desired currency exposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation. As a percentage of total plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were 9.8% and 6.0% for fixed income, including to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and negative 0.2% and 0.0% for global equity and currency overlay at December 31, 2010 and 2009. In November 2009, the Company elected to contribute $1,500 of our common stock to the pension fund. An independent fiduciary was retained to manage and liquidate the stock over time at its discretion. Plan assets included $1,498 and $1,581 of our common stock as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Risk Management In managing the plan assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability management and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach and are integral to the overall investment strategy. Further, asset classes are constructed to achieve diversification by investment strategy, by investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored regularly through the custodian. Credit parameters for counterparties have been established for managers permitted to trade over-the-counter derivatives.  Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs. ##TABLE_START    December 31, 2010   December 31, 2009     Total   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Total   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3  Fixed income securities:         Corporate  $ 13,038    $ 13,034   $ 4   $ 13,259    $ 13,254   $ 5  U.S. government and agencies   3,734     3,734     3,886     3,886   Mortgage backed and asset backed   880     847    33    916     893    23  Other   3,469   $ 19    3,450     2,628   $ 19    2,609   Derivatives:         Assets   18     18     33     33   Liabilities   (20 )    (20 )    (93 )    (93 )  Cash equivalents and other short-term investments   2,781    2,342    439     2,068    1,679    389   Currency overlay derivatives:         Assets   106     106     107     107   Liabilities   (121 )    (121 )    (94 )    (94 )  Equity securities:         U.S. common and preferred stock   4,925    4,925      4,691    4,691    Non-U.S. common and preferred stock   6,414    6,367    47     6,703    6,634    69   Boeing company stock   1,498    1,498      1,581    1,581    Common/collective/pooled funds   3,097    105    2,992     2,574    89    2,485   Derivatives:         Assets   21     21     9     9   Liabilities   (11 )    (11 )    (10 )    (10 )  Private equity   2,636    10     2,626    2,300    9     2,291  Real estate and real assets   2,488    665    5    1,818    1,784    442    5    1,337  Global strategies   2,015    443    1,503    69    1,676    484    1,192   Hedge funds   1,918            1,918    1,347        336    1,011  Total  $ 48,886   $ 16,374   $ 26,044   $ 6,468   $ 45,365   $ 15,628   $ 25,070   $ 4,667    Cash  $ 79      $ 125     Receivables   393       641     Payables   (106 )               (321 )             Total  $ 49,252      $ 45,810       ##TABLE_END Fixed income securities are primarily valued using a market approach with inputs that include broker quotes, benchmark yields, base spreads and reported trades. Cash equivalents and other short-term investments, which are used to pay benefits, are primarily held in registered money market funds which are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Other cash equivalent and short-term investments are valued daily by the fund using a market approach with inputs that include quoted market prices for similar instruments.  Common and preferred stock equity securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Common/collective/pooled funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their net asset values (NAVs) that are calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Active currency managers, through an overlay program, invest in a broad set of currency derivatives. Derivatives leveled in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued using an income approach with inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates. Exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Private equity LP valuations are reported by the fund manager and are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. Real estate and real asset fund values are primarily reported by the fund manager and are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. Publically traded REITs are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Global strategies are primarily limited liability company (LLC) or mutual fund structures. The LLCs are primarily valued using a market approach based on NAVs calculated by the fund and have monthly liquidity. Global strategies mutual funds are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Hedge funds consist of fund-of-fund LLC or commingled fund structures and direct hedge funds. The LLCs are primarily valued using a market approach based on NAVs calculated by the fund and are not publicly available. Liquidity for the LLCs is monthly and is subject to liquidity of the underlying hedge funds. The commingled fund NAV is calculated by the manager on a daily basis and has monthly liquidity. Direct hedge funds are primarily valued by each funds third party administrator based on valuation of the underlying securities and instruments and primarily applying a market or income valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument, equity, fixed income, currency or derivative, held; inputs for each of these investment types are discussed earlier. Direct hedge fund NAVs based on valuation of the underlying holdings are not publicly available and have monthly liquidity. Some of our assets, primarily our private equity, real estate and real assets, hedge funds and global strategies, do not have readily determinable market values given the specific investment structures involved and the nature of the underlying investments. For the December 31, 2010 and 2009 plan asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used where possible. For assets without readily determinable values, estimates were derived from investment manager discussions focusing on underlying fundamentals and significant events. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) we use net asset values, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events.  The following tables present a reconciliation of Level 3 assets held during the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Beginning for the year ended December 31, 2010, transfers into and out of Level 3 are treated as beginning of year values. ##TABLE_START    January 1, 2010 Balance   Net Realized and Unrealized Gains/(Losses)   Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements   Net Transfers Into/(Out of) Level 3   December 31, 2010 Balance  Fixed income securities:      Corporate  $ 5    $ (1 )   $ 4  Mortgage backed and asset backed   23   $ (1 )   15   $ (4 )   33  Private equity   2,291    379    (44 )    2,626  Real estate and real assets   1,337    157    324     1,818  Global strategies    (1 )  $ 70     69  Hedge funds   1,011    92   $ 815        1,918  Total  $ 4,667   $ 626   $ 1,179   $ (4 )  $ 6,468    ##TABLE_END For the year ended December 31, 2010, the change in unrealized gain/(loss) for Level 3 assets still held at December 31, 2010 were $1 for Mortgage backed and asset backed securities, $397 for Private equity, $136 for Real estate and real assets, $(1) for Global Strategies and $92 for Hedge funds. ##TABLE_START    January 1, 2009 Balance   Net Realized and Unrealized Gains/(Losses)   Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements   Net Transfers Into/(Out of) Level 3   December 31, 2009 Balance  Fixed income securities:      Corporate  $ 9    $ (4 )   $ 5  Mortgage backed and asset backed   49   $ 1    (32 )  $ 5    23  Private equity   2,020    142    129     2,291  Real estate and real assets   1,629    (505 )   213     1,337  Hedge funds   885    126            1,011  Total  $ 4,592   $ (236 )  $ 306   $ 5   $ 4,667    ##TABLE_END OPB Plan Assets The majority of OPB plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised of approximately 60% equities and 40% debt securities. The index fund is valued using a market approach based on the quoted market price of an identical instrument (Level 1). The expected rate of return on these assets does not have a material effect on the net periodic benefit cost. Cash Flows Contributions Required pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) as well as rules governing funding of our non-U.S. pension plans, are not expected to be material in 2011. In 2011 we expect to make discretionary contributions to our plans of approximately $500. We expect that if interest rates remain at their current levels, discount rates for ERISA determinations will likely decline in future years because of retrospective averaging, and as a result, contributions in future years are expected to increase. We expect to contribute approximately $15 to our OPB plans in 2011.  Estimated Future Benefit Payments The table below reflects the total pension benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants share of the cost, which is funded by participant contributions. OPB payments reflect our portion only. ##TABLE_START Year(s)  2011   2012   2013   2014   2015   20162020  Pensions  $ 2,731   $ 2,848   $ 2,992   $ 3,145   $ 3,279   $ 18,712  Other postretirement benefits:       Gross benefits paid   553    568    592    620    645    3,659  Medicare Part D subsidy   (31 )   (32 )   (33 )   (34 )   (35 )   (177 ) Net other postretirement benefits  $ 522   $ 536   $ 559   $ 586   $ 610   $ 3,482    ##TABLE_END Termination Provisions Certain of the pension plans provide that, in the event there is a change in control of the Company which is not approved by the Board of Directors and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required by ERISA, and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits in our group insurance benefit programs. We have an agreement with the U.S. government with respect to certain pension plans. Under the agreement, should we terminate any of the plans under conditions in which the plans assets exceed that plans obligations, the U.S. government will be entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plans assets based on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts. 401(k) Plans We provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expense for these defined contribution plans was $614, $591 and $571 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Note 15  Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements Share-Based Compensation Our 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended on April 27, 2009, permits awards of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, stock units, Performance Shares, performance units and other incentives to our employees, officers, consultants and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock available for issuance under the amended plan will not exceed 80,000,000 and no more than an aggregate of 16,000,000 shares are available for issuance as restricted stock awards. Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to meet any requirements to issue shares during 2011.  Share-based plans expense is primarily included in general and administrative expense since it is incentive compensation issued primarily to our executives. The share-based plans expense and related income tax benefit follow: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Stock options  $ 96   $ 111   $ 119  Restricted stock units and other awards   83    56    29  ShareValue Trust   36    71    61  Share-based plans expense  $ 215   $ 238   $ 209    Income tax benefit  $ 83   $ 89   $ 79    ##TABLE_END Stock Options On February 22, 2010, February 23, 2009 and February 25, 2008, we granted to our executives 5,932,806, 7,423,242 and 6,411,300 options, respectively. The options have been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. The stock options granted after 2005 vest over a period of three years, with 34% vesting after the first year, 33% vesting after the second year and the remaining 33% vesting after the third year. If an executive terminates employment for any reason, the non-vested portion of the stock option will not vest and all rights to the non-vested portion will terminate completely. Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2010 is as follows: ##TABLE_START    Shares   Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share   Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (years)   Aggregate Intrinsic Value  Number of shares under option:     Outstanding at beginning of year   26,336,436   $ 63.93    Granted   6,079,675    63.95    Exercised   (2,123,236 )   40.96    Forfeited   (1,159,701 )   55.84    Expired   (157,732 )   59.35          Outstanding at end of year   28,975,442    $65.96    6.9   $ 238  Exercisable at end of year   17,262,715   $ 72.28    5.7   $ 105    ##TABLE_END The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $59, $2 and $22 during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash received from options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $87, $10 and $44 with a related tax benefit of $20, $1 and $6, respectively, derived from the compensation deductions resulting from these option exercises. At December 31, 2010, there was $85 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the Stock Option plan which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years. The total fair value of stock options vested during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $103, $114 and $82, respectively.  The fair values of options were estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: ##TABLE_START Grant Year  Grant Date   Expected Life   Expected Volatility   Dividend Yield   Risk Free Interest Rate   Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share  2010   2/22/10    6 years    31.5 %   3.0 %   2.9 %  $ 15.70  2009   2/23/09    6 years    39.0 %   2.4 %   2.0 %   11.12  2008   2/25/08    6 years    28.8 %   1.7 %   3.2 %   23.47    ##TABLE_END The expected volatility of the stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock volatility and the volatility levels implied on the grant date by actively traded option contracts on our common stock. We determined the expected term of the stock option grants to be six years, calculated using the simplified method in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 110. We use the simplified method since we changed the vesting terms, tax treatment and the recipients of our stock options beginning in 2006 such that we believe our historical data no longer provides a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. Restricted Stock Units On February 22, 2010, we granted to our executives 1,459,256 restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of our long-term incentive program with a grant date fair value of $63.83 per share. On February 23, 2009, we granted to our executives 2,144,501 RSUs, with a fair value of $35.57 per share. The RSUs vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will immediately vest on a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year performance period. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate completely. In addition to RSUs awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant RSUs to certain executives and employees to encourage retention or to reward various achievements. These RSUs are labeled other restricted stock units in the table below. The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average stock price on the date of grant. Stock units settle in common stock on a one-for-one basis and are not contingent upon stock price. Stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2010 is as follows: ##TABLE_START    Incentive Program Restricted Stock Units   Other Restricted Stock Units  Number of units:   Outstanding at beginning of year   2,111,392    1,849,278  Granted   1,496,629    336,574  Dividends   80,631    45,753  Forfeited   (187,135 )   (36,773 ) Distributed   (75,717 )   (492,881 ) Outstanding at end of year   3,425,800    1,701,951  Unrecognized compensation cost at December 31, 2010  $ 78   $ 36  Weighted average remaining contractual life (years)   1.9    2.1    ##TABLE_END  ShareValue Trust The ShareValue Trust, established July 1, 1996, was a 14-year irrevocable trust that held shares of our common stock, received dividends, and distributed to employees the appreciation in value above a 3% per annum threshold rate of return at the end of each period. At June 30, 2010, the appreciation in stock price did not exceed the threshold, and no distribution was triggered for the final period of the trust. This was the final investment period of the trust, and no potential distributions remain. The trust was terminated effective July 1, 2010 with the 29,948,920 undistributed shares returned to the Company. Deferred tax assets of $229 related to the undistributed shares were written off at June 30, 2010, offset against previous excess tax benefits recorded in Additional paid-in capital. Other Compensation Arrangements Performance Awards Performance Awards are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a three-year period. Each unit has an initial value of $100 dollars per unit. The amount payable at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars per unit, depending on the Companys performance against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to pay these awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on the estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we granted Performance Awards to our executives with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals for each three-year period following the grant date. The minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out for the 2010 and 2009 Performance Awards is $250 and $290. There will be no payout of the 2008 Performance Awards. Deferred Compensation The Company has a deferred compensation plan which permits executives to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus, and certain other incentive awards. Prior to May 1, 2006, employees who participated in the deferred compensation plan could choose to defer in either an interest earning account or a Boeing stock unit account. Effective May 1, 2006, participants can diversify deferred compensation among 19 investment funds including the interest earning account and the Boeing stock unit account. Total expense/(income) related to deferred compensation was $112, $158 and ($223) in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Additionally, for employees who elected to defer their compensation in stock units prior to January 1, 2006, the Company matched 25% of the deferral with additional stock units. Effective January 1, 2006, all matching contributions are settled in stock upon retirement. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred compensation liability which is being marked to market was $1,149 and $1,143. Note 16  Shareholders Equity On October 29, 2007, the Board approved the repurchase of up to $7,000 of common stock (the Program). Unless terminated earlier by a Board resolution, the Program will expire when we have used all authorized funds for repurchase. At December 31, 2010, $3,610 in shares may still be purchased under the Program. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were 1,200,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. No preferred stock has been issued.

We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage currency risk associated with certain transactions, specifically forecasted sales and purchases made in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency contracts hedge forecasted transactions principally occurring within five years in the future, with certain contracts hedging transactions up to 2021. We use commodity derivatives, such as swaps and fixed-price purchase commitments, to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. These include commitments to purchase electricity at fixed prices through 2016. Fair Value Hedges Interest rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt. The net change in fair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in Boeing Capital Corporation interest expense.  Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment We also hold certain derivative instruments, primarily foreign currency forward contracts, for risk management purposes but without electing any form of hedge accounting. Notional Amounts and Fair Values The notional amounts and fair values of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Notional amounts (1)   Other assets   Other accrued liabilities     2010   2009   2010   2009   2010   2009  Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:       Foreign exchange contracts  $ 2,001   $ 2,353   $ 266   $ 233   $ (15 )  $ (22 ) Interest rate contracts   875    1,475    24    32     (18 ) Commodity contracts   144    189      (113 )   (88 ) Derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment:       Foreign exchange contracts   646    693    8    32    (58 )   (99 ) Total derivatives   3,666    4,710    298    297    (186 )   (227 ) Netting arrangements           (71 )   (119 )   71    119  Net recorded balance    $ 227   $ 178   $ (115 )  $ (108 )   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Notional amounts represent the gross contract/notional amount of the derivatives outstanding. ##TABLE_END Gains/(losses) associated with our cash flow and undesignated hedging transactions and their effect on other comprehensive loss and Net earnings were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009  Effective portion recognized in other comprehensive loss, net of taxes:   Foreign exchange contracts  $ 67   $ 180  Commodity contracts   (30 )   (24 ) Undesignated derivatives recognized in Other income/(expense), net:   Foreign exchange contracts   (33 )   (9 )   ##TABLE_END For the year ended December 31, 2010, we reclassified a net gain of $14 (pre-tax) from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings. Based on our portfolio of cash flow hedges, we expect to reclassify gains of $22 (pre-tax) during the next 12 months. Ineffectiveness related to our hedges was insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. We have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. For foreign exchange contracts with original maturities of at least five years, our derivative counterparties could require settlement if we default on our five-year credit facility, expiring November 2012. For commodity contracts, our counterparties could require collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and commodity contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at December 31, 2010 was $78. At December 31, 2010, there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives.  Note 18  Significant Group Concentrations of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments involving potential credit risk are predominantly with commercial aircraft customers and the U.S. government. Of the $10,496 in gross accounts receivable and gross customer financing included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2010, $4,996 related to commercial aircraft customers ($570 of accounts receivable and $4,426 of customer financing) and $2,969 related to the U.S. government. Of the $5,033 in gross customer financing, $4,310 related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. AirTran Airways, American Airlines, Continental Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines were associated with 27%, 16%, 9% and 8%, respectively, of our financing portfolio. Financing for aircraft is collateralized by security in the related asset. As of December 31, 2010, there was $9,865 of financing commitments related to aircraft on order including options and proposed as part of sales campaigns described in Note 11, of which $8,490 related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work. Significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include AEWC, P-8I, KC-767 International Tanker and commercial and military satellites. The operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost and revenue estimates could also result in lower margins or a material charge for reach-forward losses in 2011. Commercial Airplane Development Programs Significant risks are inherent throughout the development of new commercial airplanes and new commercial airplane derivatives. Currently both the 787-8 and 747-8 freighter are in the demanding flight test and certification stages of program development. The 787-9 and 747-8 Intercontinental airplanes are also in development. These programs require substantial investments and research and development as well as investments in working capital and infrastructure. They also entail significant commitments to customers and suppliers and require substantial internal resources. Performance issues on these programs could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results and financial position in 2011. Other Risk As of December 31, 2010, approximately 36% of our total workforce was represented by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 1% of our total workforce was represented by agreements expiring during 2011.  Note 19  Fair Value Measurements The following tables present our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs. ##TABLE_START    December 31, 2010   December 31, 2009     Total   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Total   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3  Assets         Money market funds  $ 3,337   $ 3,337     $ 3,575   $ 3,575    Available-for-sale investments:         Debt  $ 5     $ 5    112    $ 107   $ 5  Equity   10    10      27    27    Derivatives   227       $ 227        178        178      Total assets  $ 3,579   $ 3,347   $ 227   $ 5   $ 3,892   $ 3,602   $ 285   $ 5    Liabilities         Derivatives  $ (115 )      $ (115 )      $ (108 )      $ (108 )     Total liabilities  $ (115 )   $ (115 )   $ (108 )   $ (108 )    ##TABLE_END Money market funds and equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Available-for-sale debt investments are primarily valued using a market approach based on benchmark yields, reported trades and broker/dealer quotes. Derivatives include foreign currency, commodity and interest rate contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve. Certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The table below presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended December 31, and the carrying value and asset classification of the related assets still held as of December 31: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009     Carrying Value   Total Losses   Carrying Value   Total Losses  Operating lease equipment  $ 247   $ (143 )  $ 199   $ (75 ) Property, plant and equipment    (4 )   13    (13 ) Receivables           1    (6)  Total  $ 247   $ (147 )  $ 213   $ (94 )   ##TABLE_END The operating lease equipment was valued using a market approach based on the fair value for the related aircraft. The property, plant and equipment was valued using an income approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying equipment.  Fair Value Disclosures The following table presents our financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values were as follows at December 31: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009     Carrying Amount   Fair Value   Carrying Amount   Fair Value  Assets     Accounts receivable, net  $ 5,422   $ 5,283   $ 5,785   $ 5,658  Notes receivable   480    501    1,045    1,072  Liabilities     Debt, excluding capital lease obligations   (12,234 )   (13,525 )   (12,848 )   (13,809 ) Accounts payable   (7,715 )   (7,704 )   (7,096 )   (7,063 ) Residual value, credit and other guarantees   (35 )   (15 )   (35 )   (20 ) Contingent repurchase commitments   (7 )   (84 )   (7 )   (63 )   ##TABLE_END The fair values of the Accounts receivable and Accounts payable are based on current market rates for loans of the same risk and maturities. The fair values of our variable rate notes receivable that reprice frequently approximate their carrying amounts. The fair values of fixed rate notes receivable are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt is based on current market yields for our debt traded in the secondary market. The fair values of the residual value guarantees and contingent repurchase commitments are determined using a Black Futures Options formula and include such assumptions as the expected value of the aircraft on the settlement date, volatility of aircraft prices, time until settlement and the risk free discount rate. The fair value of the credit guarantees is estimated based on the expected cash flows of those commitments, given the creditors probability of default, and discounted using the risk free rate. With regard to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of future financing commitments because the amount and timing of funding those commitments are uncertain. Note 20  Legal Proceedings Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts and other matters are pending against us. Potentially material contingencies are discussed below. We are subject to various U.S. government investigations, from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such government disputes and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, except as set forth below. Unless otherwise indicated below, a range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding set forth below cannot be estimated. A-12 Litigation In 1991, the Department of the Navy (the Navy) notified McDonnell Douglas Corporation (now merged into The Boeing Company) and General Dynamics Corporation (together, the Team) that it was terminating for default the Teams contract for development and initial production of the A-12 aircraft.  The Team had full responsibility for performance of the contract and both contractors are jointly and severally liable for any potential liabilities resulting from the termination. The Team filed a legal action to contest the Navys default termination, to assert its rights to convert the termination to one for the convenience of the government, and to obtain payment for work done and costs incurred on the A-12 contract but not paid to date. As of December 31, 2010, inventories included approximately $586 of recorded costs on the A-12 contract, against which we have established a loss provision of $350. The amount of the provision, which was established in 1990, was based on McDonnell Douglas Corporations belief, supported by an opinion of outside counsel, that the termination for default would be converted to a termination for convenience, and that the best estimate of possible loss on termination for convenience was $350. On August 31, 2001, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a decision after trial upholding the governments default termination of the A-12 contract. In 2003, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, finding that the trial court had applied the wrong legal standard, vacated the trial courts 2001 decision and ordered the case sent back to the trial court for further proceedings. On May 3, 2007, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a decision upholding the governments default termination of the A-12 contract. We filed a Notice of Appeal on May 4, 2007 with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On June 2, 2009, the Court of Appeals rendered an opinion affirming the trial courts 2007 decision sustaining the governments default termination. On August 14, 2009, we filed a Combined Petition for Panel Rehearing and for Rehearing En Banc in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On November 24, 2009, the Court denied our Combined Petition. On September 28, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court granted our request to review the decision of the Court of Appeals. Oral argument was held before the Supreme Court on January 18, 2011. We expect the U.S. Supreme Court to render a decision in the case in 2011. On December 29, 2009, the Navy sent letters to the Team requesting payment of $1,352 in unliquidated progress payments, plus applicable interest. On February 19, 2010, the Navy sent a letter confirming that it would not pursue payment from the Team pending the U.S. Supreme Courts review of this matter. We believe that the termination for default is contrary to law and fact and that the loss provision established by McDonnell Douglas Corporation in 1990, which was supported by an opinion from outside counsel, continues to provide adequately for the reasonably possible reduction in value of A-12 net contracts in process as of December 31, 2010. Final resolution of the A-12 litigation will depend on the outcome of further proceedings or possible negotiations with the U.S. government. If after reviewing the Court of Appeals decision, the U.S. Supreme Court determines, contrary to our belief, that a termination for default was appropriate, we could incur an additional loss of up to $275, consisting principally of $236 of remaining inventory costs. If the courts further hold that a money judgment should be entered against the Team, we could be required to pay the U.S. government up to one-half of the unliquidated progress payments of $1,350 plus statutory interest from February 1991 (currently totaling up to $1,530). In that event, our loss would total approximately $1,711 in pre-tax charges. Should, however, the March 31, 1998 judgment of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in favor of the Team be reinstated, we could be entitled to receive payment of approximately $1,163, including interest from June 26, 1991. Employment and Benefits Litigation We have been named as a defendant in two pending class action lawsuits filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, each related to the 2005 sale of our former Wichita facility to Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. (Spirit). The first action involves allegations that Spirits hiring decisions following the sale were tainted by age discrimination, violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), violated our collective bargaining agreements, and constituted retaliation. The case was brought in 2006 as a class action on behalf of individuals not hired by Spirit. During the second quarter of 2010, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Boeing and Spirit on all class action claims.  During the third quarter of 2010, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking reconsideration of the summary judgment decision. The second action, initiated in 2007, alleges collective bargaining agreement breaches and ERISA violations in connection with alleged failures to provide benefits to certain former employees of the Wichita facility. Discovery in the case is ongoing. Spirit has agreed to indemnify Boeing for any and all losses in the first action, with the exception of claims arising from employment actions prior to January 1, 2005. While Spirit has acknowledged a limited indemnification obligation in the second action, we believe that Spirit is obligated to indemnify Boeing for any and all losses in the second action. On October 13, 2006, we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. Plaintiffs, seeking to represent a class of similarly situated participants and beneficiaries in the Boeing Company Voluntary Investment Plan (the VIP), alleged that fees and expenses incurred by the VIP were and are unreasonable and excessive, not incurred solely for the benefit of the VIP and its participants, and were undisclosed to participants. The plaintiffs further alleged that defendants breached their fiduciary duties in violation of 502(a)(2) of ERISA, and sought injunctive and equitable relief pursuant to 502(a)(3) of ERISA. During the first quarter of 2010, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted a stay of trial proceedings in the district court pending resolution of an appeal made by Boeing in 2008 to the cases class certification order. On January 21, 2011, the Seventh Circuit reversed the district courts class certification order and decertified the class. The Seventh Circuit remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. BSSI/ICO Litigation On August 16, 2004, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. (BSSI) filed a complaint for declaratory relief against ICO Global Communications (Operations), Ltd. (ICO) in Los Angeles County Superior Court seeking a declaration that ICOs prior termination of two contracts for convenience extinguished all claims between the parties. On September 16, 2004, ICO filed a cross-complaint alleging breach of contract, economic duress, fraud, unfair competition, and other claims. ICO added The Boeing Company as a defendant in October 2005 to some of these claims and for interference with contract and misappropriation of trade secrets. On January 13, 2006, BSSI filed a cross-complaint against ICO, ICO Global Communications (Holdings) Limited (ICO Holdings), ICOs parent, and Eagle River Investments, LLC, parent of both ICO and ICO Holdings, alleging fraud and other claims. The trial commenced on June 19, 2008, with ICO seeking to recover approximately $2,000 in damages, including all monies paid to BSSI and Boeing Launch Services, plus punitive damages and other unspecified damages and relief. On October 21, 2008, the jury returned a verdict awarding ICO compensatory damages of $371 plus interest, based upon findings of contract breach, fraud and interference with contract. On October 31, 2008, the jury awarded ICO punitive damages of $236. On January 2, 2009, the court entered judgment for ICO in the amount of $631 which included $24 in prejudgment interest. On February 26, 2009 the trial court granted in part and denied in part post-trial motions we filed seeking to set aside the verdict. As a result, on March 3, 2009, the court entered an amended judgment for ICO in the amount of $604, which included $371 in compensatory damages, $207 in punitive damages and $26 in prejudgment interest. Post-judgment interest will accrue on the judgment at the rate of 10% per year (simple interest) from January 2, 2009. As of December 31, 2010, the amount of post-judgment interest totaled $121. We filed a notice of appeal and ICO filed a notice of cross-appeal in March 2009. As of November 1, 2010, the appeals were fully briefed. No date has been set by the court for argument. We believe that we have substantial arguments on appeal, which we intend to pursue vigorously.  BSSI/Telesat Canada On November 9, 2006, Telesat Canada (Telesat) and a group of its insurers served BSSI with an arbitration demand alleging breach of contract, gross negligence and willful misconduct in connection with the constructive total loss of Anik F1, a model 702 satellite manufactured by BSSI. Telesat and its insurers initially sought over $385 in damages and $10 in lost profits, but revised their demand to $263. BSSI has asserted a counterclaim against Telesat for $6 in unpaid performance incentive payments and also a $180 contingent counterclaim on the theory that any ultimate award to reimburse the insurers for their payments to Telesat could only result from Telesats breach of its contractual obligation to obtain a full waiver of subrogation rights barring recourse against BSSI. We believe that the claims asserted by Telesat and its insurers lack merit, but we have notified our insurance carriers of the demand. The arbitration was stayed pending an application by Telesat to the Ontario Superior Court on a preliminary issue. On July 16, 2010, the court denied Telesats request to exclude certain evidence, but granted its alternative request to remove the Chairperson from the arbitration panel. A new Chairperson was appointed on August 19, 2010, and the stay has been lifted. The arbitration hearing has been rescheduled for April 16, 2012. On April 26, 2007, a group of our insurers filed a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois asserting certain defenses to coverage and requesting a declaration of their obligation under our insurance and reinsurance policies relating to the Telesat Anik F1 arbitration. On June 12, 2008, the court granted the insurers motion for summary judgment, concluding that our insurance policy excluded the kinds of losses alleged by Telesat. On January 16, 2009, the court granted Boeings motion for reconsideration, ruling in favor of Boeing to require the insurers to provide insurance coverage to defend the claim. The case has been stayed pending completion of the underlying arbitration. Civil Securities Litigation On November 13, 2009, plaintiff shareholders filed a putative securities fraud class action against The Boeing Company and two of our senior executives in federal district court in Chicago. This lawsuit arises from our June 2009 announcement that the first flight of the 787 Dreamliner would be postponed due to a need to reinforce an area within the side-of-body section of the aircraft. Plaintiffs contend that we were aware before June 2009 that the first flight could not take place as scheduled due to issues with the side-of-body section of the aircraft, and that our determination not to announce this delay earlier resulted in an artificial inflation of our stock price for a multi-week period in May and June 2009. In March 2010, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cognizable claim, and, on May 26, 2010, the Court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint in its entirety. On June 22, 2010, the Court accepted the plaintiffs amended complaint, which we moved to dismiss. On August 10, 2010, the Court denied the motion and on August 30, 2010, we answered the amended complaint. On September 24, 2010, we moved to strike the portions of the amended complaint attributed to a confidential source and to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. On October 14, 2010, the Court denied our motions. On December 10, 2010, we moved for reconsideration of the Courts order denying our motion to dismiss. Discovery has commenced. In addition, plaintiff shareholders have filed three similar shareholder derivative lawsuits concerning the flight schedule for the 787 Dreamliner that closely track the allegations in the putative class action lawsuit. Two of the suits were filed in Illinois state court and have been consolidated. The remaining derivative suit was filed in federal district court in Chicago. No briefing or discovery has yet taken place in any of these lawsuits. We believe the allegations in all of these cases are without merit, and we intend to contest the cases vigorously.

We recorded earnings from operations associated with our cost and equity method investments of $67, $74 and $47 in our Commercial Airplanes segment and $201, $175 and $194 primarily in our NSS segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For segment reporting purposes, we record Commercial Airplanes segment revenues and cost of sales for airplanes transferred to other segments. Such transfers may include airplanes accounted for as operating leases and considered transferred to the BCC segment and airplanes transferred to the BDS segment for further modification prior to delivery to the customer. The revenues and cost of sales for these transfers are eliminated in the Unallocated items and eliminations caption. For segment reporting purposes, we record BDS revenues and cost of sales for the modification performed on airplanes received from Commercial Airplanes when the airplane is delivered to the customer or at the attainment of performance milestones.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Boeing Company Chicago, Illinois We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2. The financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 9, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. / S / D ELOITTE  T OUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois February 9, 2011  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Boeing Company Chicago, Illinois We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 of the Company and our report dated February 9, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule. / S / D ELOITTE  T OUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois February 9, 2011  ", "5": " Item 5.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in many countries and rely extensively on a network of partners, key suppliers and subcontractors around the world. Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses  Commercial Airplanes and Boeing Defense, Space  Security (BDS)  supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands and we price our products and services to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. Commercial Airplanes is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security and space to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets often offset. BCC delivers value by supporting our business units and managing overall financing exposure. Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Commercial Airplanes  $ 31,834   $ 34,051   $ 28,263  Boeing Defense, Space  Security   31,943    33,661    32,047  Boeing Capital Corporation   639    660    703  Other segment   138    165    567  Unallocated items and eliminations   (248 )   (256 )   (671 ) Total  $ 64,306   $ 68,281   $ 60,909    ##TABLE_END Revenues in 2010 decreased by $3,975 million or 6% compared with 2009. Commercial Airplanes revenues decreased by $2,217 million due to lower 777 deliveries primarily resulting from a production rate change from 7 to 5 per month beginning in June 2010 and no deliveries on the 747 program due to the transition from the 747-400 to the 747-8. These were partially offset by increases in commercial aviation services business. BDS revenues decreased by $1,718 million primarily due to lower revenues in the Network  Space Systems (NSS) segment. Revenues in 2009 increased by $7,372 million compared with 2008 due to higher revenues in Commercial Airplanes and BDS. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $5,788 million, primarily due to higher commercial airplane deliveries in 2009. Deliveries in 2008 were lower as a result of a  labor strike in 2008. Increases were partially offset by decreases in commercial aviation services and intercompany revenues. BDS revenues increased by $1,614 million, primarily due to higher revenues in Global Services  Support (GSS) and Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA), partially offset by lower revenues in NSS. BCC revenues decreased by $43 million during the year primarily due to a decrease in the customer financing portfolio. Other segment revenues decreased by $402 million partly due to higher revenues in 2008 from the sale of four C-17 aircraft held under operating lease. Lower Unallocated items and eliminations improved revenues by $415 million primarily due to lower P-8A Poseidon intercompany revenues recognized by Commercial Airplanes in 2009 compared with 2008. Earnings From Operations The following table summarizes our earnings/(loss) from operations: (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Commercial Airplanes  $ 3,006   $ (583 )  $ 1,186  Boeing Defense, Space  Security   2,875    3,299    3,232  Boeing Capital Corporation   152    126    162  Other segment   (327 )   (152 )   (307 ) Unallocated items and eliminations   (735 )   (594 )   (323 ) Total  $ 4,971   $ 2,096   $ 3,950    ##TABLE_END Operating earnings in 2010 increased by $2,875 million compared with 2009. Commercial Airplanes earnings increased by $3,589 million, primarily due to $2,693 million of costs related to the first three 787 flight test aircraft included in research and development expense in 2009 and the 2009 reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,352 million. BDS earnings decreased by $424 million compared with 2009 due to lower revenues and margins in the BMA segment and lower revenues in the NSS segment. Other segment earnings decreased by $175 million primarily due to $119 million in intercompany guarantees related to aircraft impairment charges and reduced aircraft collateral values. Operating earnings in 2009 decreased by $1,854 million compared with 2008. Commercial Airplanes earnings decreased by $1,769 million primarily due to $2,693 million of costs related to the first three 787 flight test aircraft included in research and development expense as a result of our determination in August 2009 that these aircraft could not be sold. The earnings decrease is also attributable to $1,352 million in reach-forward losses on the 747 program in 2009, compared with $667 million in 2008. Lower commercial aviation services and intercompany earnings also contributed to lower 2009 earnings. These decreases were partially offset by higher commercial airplane deliveries in 2009 compared with 2008. BDS earnings increased by $67 million compared with 2008 primarily due to higher earnings in the BMA segment partially offset by lower earnings in the NSS segment. Other segment losses decreased by $155 million primarily due to recognition of pre-tax expense of $82 million in the prior year to increase the allowance for losses on customer financing receivables and lower environmental remediation charges compared with the prior year. Unallocated items and eliminations in 2009 reduced earnings by $271 million compared with 2008, which is further explained in the table below.  The most significant items included in Unallocated items and eliminations are shown in the following table: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)          Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Share-based plans  $ (136 )  $ (189 )  $ (149 ) Deferred compensation   (112 )   (158 )   223  Pension   54    110    (208 ) Postretirement   (59 )   (93 )   (79 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations   (482 )   (264 )   (110 ) Total  $ (735 )  $ (594 )  $ (323 )   ##TABLE_END Share-based plans expense decreased in 2010 by $53 million primarily due to the expiration of the ShareValue trust at June 30, 2010. Deferred compensation expense decreased by $46 million in 2010 and increased by $381 million in 2009. The year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price and broad stock market conditions. Other unallocated items and eliminations expense increased by $218 million in 2010 primarily due to timing of intercompany expense allocations and elimination of profit on intercompany items as well as a $55 million charitable contribution. The 2009 increase of $154 million was primarily due to timing of intercompany expense allocations, elimination of profit on intercompany items and a more favorable insurance adjustment. Unallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for U.S. government contracting purposes. We recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of $1,864 million, $1,816 million and $1,132 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period. A portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense. Earnings from operations included the following amounts allocated to business segments and Other unallocated items and eliminations. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Pension   Other Postretirement Benefits  Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008   2010   2009   2008  Allocated to business segments  $ (1,155 )  $ (989 )  $ (488 )  $ (421 )  $ (522 )  $ (428 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations   54    110    (208 )   (59 )   (93 )   (79 ) Total  $ (1,101 )  $ (879 )  $ (696 )  $ (480 )  $ (615 )  $ (507 )   ##TABLE_END  Other Earnings Items (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Earnings from operations  $ 4,971   $ 2,096   $ 3,950  Other income/(expense), net   52    (26 )   247  Interest and debt expense   (516 )   (339 )   (202 ) Earnings before income taxes   4,507    1,731    3,995  Income tax expense   (1,196 )   (396 )   (1,341 ) Net earnings from continuing operations  $ 3,311   $ 1,335   $ 2,654    ##TABLE_END Other income increased by $78 million in 2010 primarily due to investment income on higher cash and investment balances throughout 2010. The decrease in 2009 of $273 million was driven by lower investment income due to both lower interest rates and investment balances. Interest and debt expense increased by $177 million and $137 million in 2010 and 2009 due to debt issued in 2009. Our effective income tax rate was 26.5%, 22.9% and 33.6% for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our effective tax rate was higher in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily because pre-tax book income in 2010 was higher than in 2009 and because of an income tax charge of $150 million recorded during the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. This was partially offset by a tax benefit of $371 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of settling the 1998-2003 federal audit. Our effective tax rate was lower in 2009, compared with 2008, primarily because tax credits, such as research and development credits, represented a higher proportion of earnings before taxes due to the year-over-year reduction in earnings. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog Our backlog at December 31 was as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  2010   2009   2008  Contractual Backlog:    Commercial Airplanes  $ 255,591   $ 250,476   $ 278,575  Boeing Defense, Space  Security:    Boeing Military Aircraft   25,094    26,354    25,802  Network  Space Systems   9,586    7,746    8,868  Global Services  Support   13,684    11,924    10,615  Total Boeing Defense, Space  Security   48,364    46,024    45,285  Total contractual backlog  $ 303,955   $ 296,500   $ 323,860  Unobligated backlog  $ 16,871   $ 19,058   $ 28,066    ##TABLE_END Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog during 2010 was due to orders in excess of deliveries and changes in projected revenue escalation, partially reduced by cancellations of orders. The decrease in backlog during 2009 was due to deliveries in excess of orders, changes in projected revenue escalation and cancellations of orders.  Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The decrease in unobligated backlog during 2010 is due to decreases at BDS of $1,993 million compared with 2009 primarily due to funding of existing multi-year contracts including the V-22, Brigade Combat Team Modernization (BCTM) and Chinook programs, partially offset by multi-year procurement contract awards on the F/A-18 and International Space Station programs. The decrease in unobligated backlog during 2009 is primarily due to decreases at BDS of $8,904 million compared with 2008 partly due to a partial termination for convenience by the U.S. Army of the BCTM System Development and Demonstration contract relating to Manned Ground Vehicles and associated systems and equipment. Approved funding of existing multi-year contracts including the BCTM, V-22, Chinook, Proprietary and GMD programs also reduced unobligated backlog. Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment Global passenger traffic exceeded initial expectations in 2010 growing an estimated 8% for the year and showing growth over prior 2008 peak levels. Significant variation existed between regions and airline business models with emerging markets and low cost carriers leading recovery and growth into 2011. Air cargo traffic also rebounded in 2010 after two years of contraction. Led by strong growth in Asian exports, air cargo traffic recovered to peak 2007 levels and is poised to resume growth in 2011. Airlines cut capacity in 2009 to match the demand environment which allowed them to boost yields as demand recovered in 2010. Airlines have also pursued new revenue sources by expanding alliances and building ancillary revenue streams. In addition, airlines continued to focus on cutting costs and pursued consolidation opportunities, particularly in mature markets, to improve market positioning. These airline tactics, combined with improving demand and relatively stable fuel prices, have driven a strong turnaround in airline industry profitability. Airlines are forecast to earn $15 billion in 2010 following a $10 billion net loss in 2009. The 2011 outlook is for continued profitability which should allow airlines to rebuild balance sheets that suffered from fuel price spikes and recession in 2008-2009. The long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast is for a long-term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger and cargo traffic based on a projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long-term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $3.6 trillion market for 30,900 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, disease outbreaks (such as avian or H1N1 flu), terrorism, conflicts and increased global environmental regulations. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We expect the existing long-term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide (measured in real terms) to continue into the foreseeable future. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia has enabled low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins.  Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 10% of Commercial Airplanes contractual backlog in dollar terms is with U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are likely to enter the 70 to 190 seat aircraft market over the next few years. Many of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided support, including \"launch aid,\" which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airplane development activities and enables planes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. Changes in value of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies as experienced in 2010 impacted competitors revenues and profits. Competitors routinely respond to relatively weaker dollars by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer-term competitive posture. Airbus has announced such initiatives targeting overhead cost savings, a reduction in its development cycle and a significant increase in overall productivity through 2012. If the U.S. dollar strengthens again, Airbus can use the improved efficiency to fund product development, gain market share through pricing and/or improve earnings. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Revenues  $ 31,834   $ 34,051   $ 28,263  % of Total company revenues   50 %   50 %   46 % Earnings/(loss) from operations  $ 3,006   $ (583 )  $ 1,186  Operating margins   9.4 %   -1.7 %   4.2 % Research and development  $ 2,975   $ 5,383   $ 2,838  Contractual backlog  $ 255,591   $ 250,476   $ 278,575    ##TABLE_END  Revenues Year-over-year changes in Revenue are shown in the following table: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  2010 vs. 2009   2009 vs. 2008  New airplane sales  $ (2,733 )  $ 6,129  Commercial aviation services business   569    (308 ) Other   (53 )   (33 ) Total  $ (2,217 )  $ 5,788    ##TABLE_END Revenues for 2010 decreased by $2,217 million or 6.5% compared with 2009. The decrease in new airplane revenues primarily reflects lower 777 deliveries resulting from a production rate change from 7 to 5 per month beginning in June 2010 and no deliveries on the 747 program due to the transition from the 747-400 to the 747-8 derivative. The increase in revenues from commercial aviation services business was primarily due to increased sales of spares. The increase in revenue of $5,788 million in 2009 from 2008 was primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries partially offset by lower intercompany revenues. 2008 revenues were negatively impacted by a 2008 IAM strike. The decrease in revenues from commercial aviation services business was driven by economic conditions. Commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    737   747   767   777   Total  2010      Cumulative Deliveries   3,504    1,418    994    910   Deliveries   376 (1)        12    74    462  2009      Cumulative Deliveries   3,128    1,418    982    836   Deliveries   372 (1)    8    13    88    481  2008      Cumulative Deliveries   2,756    1,410    969    748   Deliveries   290 (1)    14    10 (1)    61    375    ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Includes intercompany deliveries of 5 737 aircraft in 2010, 5 737 aircraft in 2009 and 2 767 aircraft and 2 737 aircraft in 2008. ##TABLE_END Earnings From Operations Earnings from operations for 2010 increased by $3,589 million compared with 2009. The increase was primarily due to the 2009 reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of costs related to the first three 787 flight test aircraft, and the 2009 reach-forward losses on the 747 program. Costs of $2,693 million included in research and development expense in 2009 for the first three flight test 787 airplanes were a result of our determination that these aircraft could not be sold. The reach-forward loss on the 747 program of $1,352 million during 2009 was primarily due to increased production costs, reductions in projected delivery price increases associated with escalation and the difficult market conditions affecting the 747-8. The remaining net decrease in earnings for 2010 was primarily attributable to increased research and development expense of $285 million and lower new airplane deliveries.  Earnings from operations for 2009 decreased by $1,769 million compared with 2008, primarily due to the reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of the three 787 flight test aircraft previously recorded as inventory, partially offset by a $148 million decrease in other research and development expense. The decrease in earnings is also attributable to $1,352 million in reach-forward losses on the 747 program in 2009, compared with $685 million in 2008. Lower commercial aviation services revenues and margins reduced earnings by $245 million. Higher infrastructure cost allocations related to the 787 and 747-8 schedule delays announced in 2008 and 2009 and infrastructure costs incurred during the 2008 IAM strike reduced earnings by $199 million. Increased period and other costs reduced earnings by $47 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased earnings of $1,934 million related to new airplane deliveries. Backlog Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before Boeing and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their Board of Directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers. The increase in contractual backlog during 2010 was due to orders in excess of deliveries and changes in projected revenue escalation, partially reduced by cancellations of orders. The decrease in backlog during 2009 was due to deliveries in excess of orders, changes in projected revenue escalation and cancellations of orders. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a programs life. Estimation of each programs accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. Commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs, a portion of which does not vary with production rates. As the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity increases, the average cost of the accounting quantity also increases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates. This has the effect of decreasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change. The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.  The table below provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. ##TABLE_START    Program     737   747   767   777   787  2010      Program accounting quantities   5,000    1,524    1,048    1,150    *  Undelivered units under firm orders   2,186    107    50    253    847  Cumulative firm orders   5,690    1,525    1,044    1,163    847  2009      Program accounting quantities   4,600    1,499    1,035    1,100    *  Undelivered units under firm orders   2,076    108    59    281    851  Cumulative firm orders   5,204    1,526    1,041    1,117    851  2008      Program accounting quantities   4,200    1,499    1,023    1,050    *  Undelivered units under firm orders   2,270    114    70    350    910  Cumulative firm orders   5,026    1,524    1,039    1,098    910    ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START * A final determination of the initial accounting quantity for the 787 program will be made in the quarter of first airplane delivery, targeted for the third quarter of 2011. ##TABLE_END 737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 400 units during 2010. During 2010, we announced plans to increase monthly production of the 737 from 31.5 to 35 airplanes per month beginning in the first quarter of 2012 and a further increase to 38 airplanes per month beginning in the second quarter of 2013. 747 Program The accounting quantity for the 747 program increased by 25 units during 2010. During 2009 and 2008, we recorded charges of $1,352 million and $685 million to recognize reach-forward losses on the 747 program reflecting higher than anticipated costs, a reduction in delivery price increases associated with escalation and difficult cargo market conditions which caused us to defer a planned production rate increase for 747-8. First flight of the 747-8 Freighter occurred on February 8, 2010. A fourth aircraft was added to the flight test program in July 2010 to improve flight test efficiency. On September 30, 2010, we announced that the expected first delivery of the 747-8 Freighter would move to the middle of 2011 from the fourth quarter of 2010 and a fifth airplane would be added to the flight test fleet to support the new schedule. The new delivery schedule followed an assessment of the expected cumulative impact of flight test discoveries, which include a low frequency vibration in certain flight conditions and an underperforming aileron actuator. While neither issue required structural changes to the airplane, they led to disruptions to certification testing, which the program was unable to offset within the prior schedule. We are currently producing 747-8 airplanes and until completion of our flight test program, there is risk that additional items may be identified that require further modifications or other changes to those aircraft we have produced. On March 19, 2010, we announced that we will accelerate, from mid-2013 to mid-2012, a planned production rate increase from 1.5 to 2 airplanes per month. Certification and first delivery of the Intercontinental passenger derivative is expected in the fourth quarter of 2011. Schedule and other risks inherent in the demanding flight test and certification phases of program development remain. 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 13 units during 2010. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 50 units during 2010. In April 2009, we announced that monthly production of the 777 will decline from 7 to 5 airplanes per month  beginning in June 2010. In March 2010, we announced that we will accelerate by approximately six months, from early 2012 to mid-2011, a planned production rate increase to 7 airplanes per month. In December 2010, we announced that monthly production of the 777 will increase from 7 to 8.3 airplanes per month in the first quarter 2013. 787 Program First flight of the 787 occurred on December 15, 2009 and flight testing for certification continued during 2010. Flight testing involves six flight test aircraft and a limited amount of testing on two production-configured airplanes prior to first delivery. On August 27, 2010, we announced that the expected date of first delivery of the 787 had been moved to mid-first quarter 2011 from the fourth quarter of 2010. This schedule revision followed an assessment of the cumulative impact of a number of issues, including supplier workmanship issues related to the horizontal stabilizer, instrumentation delays and the expected availability date of an engine needed to support the final phases of flight test. On November 9, 2010, a flight test aircraft lost primary electrical power as a result of an onboard fire. Back-up systems functioned as expected allowing the crew to complete a safe landing. Flight testing was suspended pending investigation. On November 24, 2010, we announced minor design changes to power distribution panels and updates to systems software resulting from the investigation. On December 23, 2010, we resumed Boeing flight test activities and on January 17, 2011 resumed certification testing. On January 18, 2011, we announced that the expected date of first delivery had been moved to the third quarter of 2011 due to the flight testing and certification delays. A number of engineering and other design changes have been identified in conjunction with the flight test program that are being incorporated into our production system and on aircraft already completed. During 2010, we continued to produce 787 airplanes and until completion of our flight test program, there is risk that additional items will be identified that require further modifications or other changes to those aircraft we have produced. We continue to monitor and address challenges associated with assembly of initial airplanes including management of our extended global supply chain, incorporation of design changes into aircraft in various stages of assembly, completion and integration of traveled work as well as weight and systems integration. For example, during the second quarter of 2010 we delayed some 787 component deliveries to reduce out of sequence work moving into final assembly at our Everett factory and improve supply chain efficiency. We continue to work toward planned increases in 787 production rates as well as the timely introduction of the 787-9 derivative. Such efforts include the construction of a second assembly line in North Charleston, South Carolina and establishing transitional surge capacity at our Everett, Washington location. On July 1, 2010, we completed firm configuration of the 787-9 airplane with first delivery scheduled for late 2013. We continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes, including delivery delays and supplier assertions. Efforts continue to ensure we remain focused on satisfying customer mission and performance needs in light of the anticipated weight of their respective aircraft. A number of our customers have contractual remedies for schedule delays and/or performance. We continue to address customer and supplier claims and requests for other contractual relief as brought forth. During 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs associated with these aircraft were included in research and development expense. We believe that the other three 787 flight test aircraft are commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to those aircraft in program inventory at December 31, 2010. If we determine that one or more of the other flight test aircraft cannot be sold, we may incur additional charges.  Our current assessment is that the program is not in a reach-forward loss position, however the cumulative impacts of the production challenges, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts have created significant pressure on program profitability and we expect to record zero margin on our initial deliveries. We continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to address this pressure. Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to aircraft delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the aircraft. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. These costs are expected to increase with 787 and 747-8 entry into service. Research and Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned certification/initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. Our Research and development expense decreased by $2,408 million in 2010. This was primarily due to the reclassification to research and development expense of $2,693 million of production costs related to the three 787 flight test aircraft in 2009, partially offset by a $285 million increase of other research and development expense. Our Research and development expense increased by $2,545 million in 2009. This was due to the 2009 reclassification of production costs related to the three 787 flight test aircraft and $50 million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments, partially offset by a $198 million decrease of other research and development expense. Additional Considerations The 787 and 747-8 programs highlight the risks inherent in new airplane programs and new derivative airplanes, particularly as both the 747-8 Freighter and the 787-8 continue the demanding flight test and certification phases of program development. Development also continues on the 787-9 and 747-8 Intercontinental. Costs related to development of new programs and derivative airplanes are expensed as incurred. Costs to produce new aircraft are included in inventory and accounted for using program accounting. Airplane programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated production costs exceed our estimated program revenues for the accounting quantity. Generally commercial airplanes are sold on a firm fixed-price basis with an indexed price escalation clause and are often sold several years before scheduled delivery. Each customer purchase agreement contains an escalation clause to account for the effects of economic fluctuations over the period of time from airplane sale to airplane delivery. A price escalation formula based on pre-defined factors is used to determine the final price of  the airplane at the time of customer delivery. While firm fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. Many new airplanes and derivatives have highly complex designs, utilize exotic materials and require extensive coordination and integration with supplier partners. As technical or quality issues arise, such as issues experienced on the 787 and 747-8 programs, we may experience schedule delays and higher costs to complete new programs and derivative aircraft. Additionally, price escalation factors may also impact margins by reducing the estimated price of airplanes delivered in the future. There are other factors that could also result in lower margins or a material charge if a program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses. These include: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for derivative airplanes and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Boeing Defense, Space  Security Business Environment and Trends U.S. Defense Environment Overview The U.S. continues to balance funding priorities to plan for the broadest possible range of operations that include homeland defense, natural disasters, stabilization efforts, counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations, or nation state aggressors with growing sophistication and military means. The U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) faces the simultaneous requirements to execute the national security policy, recapitalize important capabilities, and transform the force to meet the changing national security threat environment as articulated in the 2010 National Security Strategy and Quadrennial Defense Review. These actions must be carried out against a backdrop of significant competing national priorities including the economic crisis, the national debt and healthcare reform. As a result, the traditional roles of defense and security are converging into a single set of customer needs. We anticipate that the national security environment will remain dynamic and challenging well into this decade trending with the threat environment. U.S. government policies impacting the defense environment include: efficiency initiatives to save at least $100 billion through 2016, defense acquisition reform, increased insourcing, concerns over the decline of the U.S. industrial base, a shift in emphasis towards more affordable solutions, and emphasis on increasing diplomatic efforts to expand and strengthen our alliances. In January 2011, the U.S. DoD announced its intention to further reduce its top-line base budget by $78 billion over the next five years. Although the U.S. DoD budget has grown substantially over the past decade, we expect the total budget growth rate to level off or even decline slightly over the next several years due to these shifting priorities and budget pressures. The fiscal year 2011 discretionary budget of $708 billion includes an Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget of $159 billion. Procurement is expected to increase, while research and development accounts are expected to decrease due to growing requirements from operations and maintenance (OM) and personnel costs tied to U.S. commitments overseas. However, this trend is partially offset by equipment recapitalization efforts and continued demand for systems development. The near-term forecast of the defense budget environment shows limited growth in the 2012 to 2016 period for investment efforts. Although opportunities may exist following complete U.S. troop draw-downs in Iraq in late 2011, they may be offset by sustained OM requirements in Afghanistan. Early indications suggest that coalition forces will sustain operations in the Afghanistan Theater longer than initially anticipated. We continue to see pressure to reduce OCO requests that have been used to cover the ongoing costs of the wars.  It is unlikely that the U.S. DoD will be able to fully fund all programs of record already in development as well as new initiatives. This imbalance between future costs of programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the U.S. DoD and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules, restructuring programs, and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding and occasionally by cancellation of programs. We expect the U.S. DoD will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies from acquisition efficiencies and reforms and emphasizing utilization of commercial off-the-shelf solutions and network-enabled operations. These strategies will be enabled through persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), long-range strike, special operations, unmanned systems, cybersecurity, precision-guided kinetic and non-kinetic weapons, electronic warfare, as well as selected outsourcing of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs. International Environment Overview The international market continues to be driven by rapidly evolving security challenges and countries need to modernize aging inventories. Western governments are pressured by new threats to security while at the same time dealing with constrained budgets. In Europe, global economic conditions are creating downward pressure on budget resources and austerity measures have been put in place to reduce defense spending in the near term. The strongest opportunities for 2011 growth of the BDS portfolio will be in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions where modernization budgets remain relatively stable. With increasing needs and aging equipment, these regions have the financial strength necessary to make future defense purchases. Boeing's portfolio of defense, space and security solutions offers proven capability, predictable price, and near-term availability that are well matched to this challenging international environment. Adjacent Market Environment Overview We are repositioning our business to expand our capabilities and accelerate growth in the following targeted adjacencies: Unmanned Systems; Cyber and Information Services; Security; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); and Logistics Command and Control (LogC2) and Energy Services. We anticipate continued growth in unmanned systems as these products provide critical mission functions to the warfighter with a focus on affordability, persistence, and accuracy. The demand for defensive, offensive, and exploit operations in the emerging Cyber market provides unique growth opportunities as explicit needs are further defined by customers. Key growth areas in Security include aviation security, border security, maritime security and cybersecurity as the U.S. government looks to work more closely with state and local institutions. The dependence on time-critical information for intelligence-based operations has fueled the need for C4ISR technologies that locate, identify, and track elusive and ephemeral targets. We continue to find opportunity in the LogC2 market in areas including logistics operations, supply chain management, and logistics training and simulations. Lastly, as energy volatility increases and pressure is placed on the national grid infrastructure, we expect that the need for energy services such as energy management, infrastructure security, and scenario modeling will increase accordingly. BDS Realignment Effective January 1, 2010, 2009 and 2008, certain programs were realigned among BDS segments. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment.  Operating Results (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Revenues  $ 31,943   $ 33,661   $ 32,047  % of Total company revenues   50 %   49 %   53 % Earnings from operations  $ 2,875   $ 3,299   $ 3,232  Operating margins   9.0 %   9.8 %   10.1 % Research and development  $ 1,136   $ 1,101   $ 933  Contractual backlog  $ 48,364   $ 46,024   $ 45,285  Unobligated backlog  $ 16,822   $ 18,815   $ 27,719    ##TABLE_END Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues and earnings, may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Revenues BDS revenues decreased by $1,718 million in 2010 compared with 2009, due to lower revenues in all three segments, with the largest decrease in the NSS segment. BDS revenues increased by $1,614 million in 2009 compared with 2008, due to higher revenues in GSS and BMA, partially offset by decreases in NSS. Operating Earnings BDS operating earnings in 2010 decreased by $424 million compared with 2009 primarily due to lower margins in the BMA segment and lower revenues in the NSS segment. BDS operating earnings in 2009 increased by $67 million compared with 2008 primarily due to higher earnings in the BMA segment, partially offset by lower earnings in the NSS segment. Backlog Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. BDS total backlog increased by less than 1% in 2010, from $64,839 million to $65,186 million, primarily due to multi-year procurement contract awards on the F/A-18 and International Space Station programs, two commercial satellite contract awards, and the UK Future Logistics Information Services (FLIS) contract award, offset by current year deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional Considerations Our business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished. Examples of these programs include Family of Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals, BCTM, GMD, Joint Tactical Radio System, P-8A Poseidon and Proprietary programs. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays  and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of our fixed-price development programs include Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEWC), P-8I, KC-767 International Tanker, and commercial and military satellites. Boeing Military Aircraft Operating Results (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Revenues  $ 14,238   $ 14,304   $ 13,445  % of Total company revenues   22 %   21 %   22 % Earnings from operations  $ 1,258   $ 1,528   $ 1,294  Operating margins   8.8 %   10.7 %   9.6 % Research and development  $ 589   $ 582   $ 486  Contractual backlog  $ 25,094   $ 26,354   $ 25,802  Unobligated backlog  $ 8,297   $ 9,297   $ 10,035    ##TABLE_END Revenues BMA revenues decreased by less than 1% in 2010 and increased by 6% in 2009. Lower revenues in 2010 on the C-17, Apache and T-45 programs were nearly offset by higher Chinook, F/A-18 and AEWC revenues. The increase of $859 million in 2009 was primarily due to higher revenues on the Apache, V-22, Chinook, F/A-18, and Proprietary programs, partly offset by lower revenues on the F-22 and several weapons programs. Deliveries of new-build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  F/A-18 Models   50    49    45  F-15E Eagle   13    13    14  C-17 Globemaster   14    16    16  AH-64 Apache   13    23    3  CH-47 Chinook   20    11    12  AEWC   4    KC-767 Tanker   1    2    2  T-45TS Goshawk       7    7  Total new-build production aircraft   115    121    99    ##TABLE_END Operating Earnings BMA earnings decreased by $270 million in 2010 primarily due to lower deliveries of C-17 aircraft and less favorable pricing and mix on the C-17 program. BMA operating earnings increased by $234 million in 2009 partly due to higher deliveries on several programs and volume, partially offset by a change in delivery mix. Operating earnings in both years were negatively impacted by charges recorded on the AEWC and KC-767 International Tanker programs.  Research and Development The BMA segment continues to focus research and development resources to leverage customer knowledge, technical expertise and system integration of manned and unmanned systems that provide innovative solutions to meet the warfighters enduring needs. Research and development expense remained flat in 2010 but in 2009 increased by 20% over 2008 primarily due to increased prototyping activities which were partially offset by lower international tanker development costs. Research and development activities utilize our capabilities in architectures, system-of-systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to better prepare us to meet customers needs in U.S. and international growth areas such as: military-commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, global strike, missiles and unmanned airborne systems, and surveillance and engagement systems. The products of our research and development support both new manned and unmanned systems as well as enhanced versions of existing fielded products. Investments support vertical integration of our product line in areas such as autonomous operation of unmanned systems, advanced sensors and electronic warfare. These efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness, interoperability, reliability and reducing the cost of ownership. Backlog BMA total backlog in 2010 decreased 6% from 2009, primarily due to deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years partially offset by a multi-year contract award on the F/A-18 program. Total backlog in 2009 was virtually unchanged from 2008. Backlog increases due to 2009 orders for C-17, P-8I and Chinook aircraft were offset by revenues recognized on multi-year contracts received in prior years with the largest decrease in the F/A-18 program. Additional Considerations AEWC The AEWC development program, also known as Wedgetail in Australia, Peace Eagle in Turkey and Peace Eye in the Republic of Korea, consists of 737-700 aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems, some of which have never been installed on an airplane before. Wedgetail includes six aircraft and Peace Eagle and Peace Eye include four aircraft each. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded charges increasing the reach-forward losses on the AEWC programs in Australia and Turkey by $174 million, $133 million and $308 million, respectively. These charges reflect technical performance issues associated with the test program, delivery schedule delays, subsystem development issues, and additional time for integration testing. During 2010, four Wedgetail aircraft were delivered to Australia with initial customer acceptance. Final customer acceptance for all six Wedgetail aircraft is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2011. In January 2011, the Peace Eagle program began the formal test phase. These are advanced and complex fixed-price development programs involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability. We believe that the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate; however, the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be delayed. KC-767 International Tanker The KC-767 International Tanker program includes four aircraft for the Italian Air Force and four aircraft for the Japanese Air Self Defense Force. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded charges increasing the reach-forward losses in the KC-767 International Tanker program by $53 million, $78 million and $85 million, respectively. The final delivery to Japan was made in December 2009 and first delivery to Italy was made in December 2010. The Italian KC-767 Tanker program is ongoing, and while we believe the revenue and cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of the program creates financial risk as additional completion and development costs may be necessary or remaining scheduled delivery dates could be delayed. C-17 See the discussion of the C-17 program in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Network  Space Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Revenues  $ 9,455   $ 10,877   $ 11,346  % of Total company revenues   15 %   16 %   19 % Earnings from operations  $ 711   $ 839   $ 1,034  Operating margins   7.5 %   7.7 %   9.1 % Research and development  $ 417   $ 397   $ 298  Contractual backlog  $ 9,586   $ 7,746   $ 8,868  Unobligated backlog  $ 8,435   $ 9,187   $ 16,981    ##TABLE_END Revenues NSS revenues decreased 13% in 2010 and 4% in 2009. The decrease of $1,422 million in 2010 is primarily due to lower volume on the BCTM and GMD programs. The decrease of $469 million in 2009 is primarily due to lower volume on the GMD, Intelligence and Security Systems, and Proprietary programs, partly offset by higher volume on several satellite programs. Delta launch and new-build satellite deliveries were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Delta II   1    1    2  Delta IV   1    1   Commercial and civil satellites   3    3    1  Military satellites   1    3     ##TABLE_END Operating Earnings NSS earnings decreased by $128 million in 2010 primarily due to lower revenues. NSS earnings decreased by $195 million in 2009 primarily due to lower revenues and charges related to the Sea Launch bankruptcy. Earnings in 2009 were also reduced by charges related to the settlement of a satellite contract dispute and indemnification of Delta II inventory. Earnings in 2008 included a favorable settlement on a civil satellite program. NSS operating earnings include equity earnings of $189 million, $164 million and $178 million from the United Space Alliance joint venture and the United Launch Alliance (ULA) joint venture in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Research and Development The NSS research and development funding remains focused on the development of C4ISR that support a network-enabled architecture approach for our customers. We are investing in capabilities to enhance connectivity between existing and new air/ground and maritime platforms, to increase communications availability, utility and bandwidth through more robust space systems, and to leverage innovative networking and ISR concepts. Investments were also made to develop concepts and capabilities related to cyber and security products, as well as the development of next-generation space and intelligence systems. Along with increased funding to support these network-enabled capabilities, we also maintained our investment levels in missile defense, directed energy and advanced exploration systems. Backlog NSS total backlog increased 6% in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to two commercial satellite contract awards, a multi-year contract award on the International Space Station program and GMD contract awards, partially offset by revenues recognized on the BCTM program. Total backlog decreased by 34% in 2009 compared with 2008 partly due to the partial termination for convenience by the U.S. Army of the BCTM System Development and Demonstration contract related to Manned Ground Vehicles and associated systems and equipment. 2009 deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years including BCTM, GMD, and Proprietary programs also contributed to the backlog reduction.  Additional Considerations United Launch Alliance On December 1, 2006, we and Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) created a 50/50 joint venture named United Launch Alliance L.L.C. ULA combines the production, engineering, test and launch operations associated with U.S. government launches of Boeing Delta and Lockheed Atlas rockets. We initially contributed net assets of $914 million at December 1, 2006. The book value of our investment exceeded our proportionate share of ULAs net assets. This difference is expensed ratably in future years. Based on the adjusted contributions and the conformed accounting policies established by ULA, this amortization is expected to be approximately $15 million annually for the next 14 years. In connection with the formation of ULA, we and Lockheed each committed to provide up to $200 million to support ULAs working capital requirements through December 1, 2011. We and Lockheed transferred performance responsibility for certain U.S. government contracts to ULA as of the closing date. We and Lockheed agreed to jointly guarantee the performance of those contracts to the extent required by the U.S. government. We and Lockheed have also each committed to provide ULA with up to $232 million of additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 million of Boeing Delta launch program inventory included in contributed assets plus $1,860 million of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021. Since inception, ULA has consumed $1,201 million of inventory that was contributed by us. ULA has made advance payments of $420 million to us and we have recorded revenues and cost of sales of $166 million under the inventory supply agreement through December 31, 2010. ULA is continuing to assess the future of the Delta II program beyond what is currently on contract. In the event ULA is unable to sell additional Delta II inventory, our earnings could be reduced by up to $70 million. We agreed to indemnify ULA against potential losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) for four satellite missions. We believe ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing. In December 2008, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value for two satellite missions. In March 2009, the USAF issued a denial of that claim and in June 2009, ULA filed an appeal. During 2009, the USAF exercised its option for a third satellite mission. During the third quarter of 2010, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value of the third mission. The USAF did not exercise an option for a fourth mission prior to expiration. If ULA is unsuccessful in obtaining additional pricing, we may be responsible for a portion of the shortfall and may record up to $283 million in pre-tax losses associated with the three missions, representing up to $261 million for the indemnification payment and up to $22 million for our portion of additional contract losses incurred by ULA. Sea Launch See the discussion of the Sea Launch receivables in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Satellites See the discussions of Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. (BSSI) in Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Global Services  Support Operating Results (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Revenues  $ 8,250   $ 8,480   $ 7,256  % of Total company revenues   13 %   12 %   12 % Earnings from operations  $ 906   $ 932   $ 904  Operating margins   11.0 %   11.0 %   12.5 % Research and development  $ 130   $ 122   $ 149  Contractual backlog  $ 13,684   $ 11,924   $ 10,615  Unobligated backlog  $ 90   $ 331   $ 703    ##TABLE_END Revenues GSS revenues decreased $230 million in 2010, a decrease of 3%, and increased $1,224 million in 2009, an increase of 17%, in each case compared with the prior year. The 2010 decrease is primarily due to lower revenues on several Maintenance, Modifications and Upgrades (MMU) programs partially offset by higher revenues on several Integrated Logistics (IL) programs. The 2009 increase was due to increased volume in the IL programs and the Training Systems and Services (TSS) divisions. Operating Earnings GSS operating earnings decreased by 3% in 2010 primarily due to lower revenues. Operating earnings increased 3% in 2009 as additional earnings from increased volume were partially offset by lower margins due to contract adjustments and changes in contract mix. Research and Development GSS continues to focus investment strategies on its core businesses including IL, MMU and TSS, as well as on moving into new market areas of logistics command and control (Log C2) in Advanced Services and energy management in Boeing Energy. Investments have been made to continue the development and implementation of innovative tools, processes and systems as market discriminators in the delivery of integrated customer solutions. Backlog GSS total backlog increased by 12% in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to the award of the UK FLIS contract. Backlog also increased due to increases in several IL and MMU programs, partially offset by decreases in several Training Systems programs. Total backlog increased by 8% in 2009 compared with 2008 due to significant growth in International Support and Defense and Government Services programs and partially offset by decreases in several IL and MMU programs. Boeing Capital Corporation Business Environment and Trends BCCs customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2010 totaled $4,694 million. A substantial portion of BCCs portfolio is concentrated among certain U.S. commercial airline customers. BCCs portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types most notably out of production Boeing aircraft such as 717 aircraft. We provided greater amounts of financing to Boeing customers during 2009 than in any of the preceding five years. Sources of financing available for aircraft deliveries improved during 2010 and as a result, we provided no financing for Boeing aircraft deliveries. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,200 western-built commercial jet aircraft (10.5% of current world fleet) were  parked at the end of 2010, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, over 30% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2009 and 2008, 11.6% and 11.0% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. Summary Financial Information (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Revenues  $ 639   $ 660   $ 703  Earnings from operations  $ 152   $ 126   $ 162  Operating margins   24 %   19 %   23 %   ##TABLE_END Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease and interest from financing receivables and notes. BCCs revenues decreased $21 million and $43 million in 2010 and 2009, due to a smaller portfolio of equipment under operating leases as a result of aircraft returns and lower lease rates on re-leased aircraft. Earnings From Operations BCCs operating earnings are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Operating earnings increased by $26 million in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to lower impairment expense and lower provision for losses. The impact of declines in aircraft collateral values recognized by BCC and reduced projected cash flows for certain aircraft was not as significant in 2010 as it was in 2009. The decrease in operating earnings in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower revenues and higher asset impairment expense and provision for losses. Financial Position The following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  2010   2009  BCC Customer Financing and Investment Portfolio  $ 4,694   $ 5,666  Valuation Allowance as a % of Total Receivables   3.8 %   2.5 % Debt  $ 3,446   $ 4,075  Debt-to-Equity Ratio   5.0-to-1    5.8-to-1    ##TABLE_END BCCs customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2010 decreased from December 31, 2009 due to normal portfolio run-off and asset pre-payments. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, BCC had $583 million and $385 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease, of which $28 million and $345 million had either executed term sheets with deposits or firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease. The increase was primarily due to BCCs termination of aircraft leases with Aevovias Caribe S.A. de C.V. (Click), an affiliate of Compania Mexicana de Aviacion S.A. de C.V. (Mexicana), in August 2010. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $174 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2011. These aircraft are being remarketed or we are seeking to have the leases extended.  BCC enters into certain transactions with the Other segment in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment. Bankruptcies In August 2010, Mexicana filed for bankruptcy protection in Mexico and the United States. At the time of those filings, BCC had leased and delivered 19 717 aircraft to Click, and 6 additional 717 aircraft were scheduled for delivery to Click under executed leases. On August 27, 2010, BCC served Click a notice of termination of all 25 leases as a result of non-payment. On or about August 28, 2010, Click ceased flight operations. In September 2010, Click filed for bankruptcy protection. BCC has recovered all of the aircraft that had been delivered to Click. In the third quarter of 2010, we recorded an $81 million net impairment charge related to certain 717 aircraft leased to Click. This charge was primarily recorded in the Other segment due to an intercompany guarantee between us and BCC. Additional impairment charges could be recorded if we are unable to re-lease the aircraft at anticipated rental rates. Southwest/AirTran Merger On September 26, 2010, Southwest Airlines Co. (Southwest) and AirTran Holdings, Inc. (AirTran) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, whereby Southwest will acquire, subject to certain conditions, all of the outstanding common stock of AirTran. AirTran, together with its subsidiaries, represents approximately 27% of our gross customer financing portfolio carrying value, consisting principally of 717 aircraft. AirTran is the largest customer in terms of BCCs segment revenue and customer financing portfolio carrying value. Restructurings and Restructuring Requests From time to time, certain customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with BCC. As of December 31, 2010, BCC has not reached agreement on any restructuring requests that would have a material adverse effect on its earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. Other Segment (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Revenues  $ 138   $ 165   $ 567  Loss from operations   (327 )   (152 )   (307 )   ##TABLE_END Other segment operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $175 million primarily due to $144 million of charges related to our customer financing portfolio and higher environmental remediation expenses of $36 million. Other segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $402 million compared with 2008 primarily due to the sale of three C-17 aircraft in 2008 held under operating lease. Other segment operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $155 million primarily due to recognition of pre-tax expense of $82 million in the prior year to increase the allowance for losses on customer financing receivables related to lower U.S. airline customer credit ratings. During 2009, Other segment recognized $76 million in lower charges relating to environmental remediation than in 2008.  Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Summary ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)    Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Net earnings  $ 3,307   $ 1,312   $ 2,672  Non-cash items   2,679    2,381    1,829  Changes in working capital   (3,034 )   1,910    (4,902 ) Net cash provided/(used) by operating activities   2,952    5,603    (401 ) Net cash (used)/provided by investing activities   (4,831 )   (3,794 )   1,888  Net cash (used)/provided by financing activities   (1,962 )   4,094    (5,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents   (15 )   44    (59 ) Net (decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents   (3,856 )   5,947    (3,774 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year   9,215    3,268    7,042  Cash and cash equivalents at end of year  $ 5,359   $ 9,215   $ 3,268    ##TABLE_END Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2,651 million to $2,952 million during 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to higher net working capital in 2010, driven by growth in inventory as we continue to build inventories prior to the anticipated delivery and production ramp-up of the 787 and 747-8 programs. We expect the 787 inventory growth in 2011 to be similar to the growth experienced in 2010 while we expect 747-8 inventory to begin to decline as aircraft are delivered. Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities totaled $4,831 million during 2010 compared with $3,794 million used during 2009, primarily due to higher net contributions to time deposits during 2010. In 2010, capital expenditures totaled $1,125 million down from $1,186 million in 2009. We expect capital spending in 2011 to be higher than 2010 due to the ongoing construction of a 787 final assembly line in North Charleston, South Carolina and higher spending to support commercial airplane production rate increases. Expenditures on acquisitions totaled $932 million, up from $639 million, largely reflecting the acquisition of Argon ST, Inc. for $782 million. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities totaled $1,962 million during 2010 compared with $4,094 million provided during 2009, primarily due to proceeds from borrowings of $5,961 million in 2009. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the recorded balance of debt was $12,421 million and $12,924 million, of which $948 million and $707 million were classified as short-term. This includes $3,446 million and $4,075 million of debt recorded at BCC, of which $801 million and $659 million were classified as short-term. In 2010, we repaid $689 million of debt, including repayments of $645 million of debt held at BCC. In 2010, we had 494,939 shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholding and did not repurchase any shares through our open market share repurchase program. During 2009 and 2008, cash used in our open market share repurchase program totaled $50 million and $2,937 million. In 2008, we also repurchased shares for $95 million as part of the ShareValue Trust distribution. Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We and BCC have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2010 and at December 31, 2010, neither we nor BCC had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $4,376 million ($1,500 million exclusively available for BCC) of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support possible commercial paper borrowings.  In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our pension plans were $9,854 million and $6,356 million underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an ERISA basis our plans are more than 100% funded. In 2011, we expect to make discretionary contributions to our plans of approximately $500 million. Absent increases in interest rates and/or higher asset values, we may be required to make significant contributions to our pension plans in the future. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2010, and the estimated timing thereof. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Total   Less than 1 year   1-3 years   3-5 years   After 5 years  Long-term debt (including current portion)  $ 12,253   $ 876   $ 3,510   $ 2,103   $ 5,764  Interest on debt (1)   6,990    622    1,025    773    4,570  Pension and other postretirement cash requirements   20,638    632    1,622    6,643    11,741  Capital lease obligations   190    63    97    30   Operating lease obligations   1,159    217    280    164    498  Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position   104,775    34,572    40,197    20,442    9,564  Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position   12,676    12,345    331          Total contractual obligations  $ 158,681   $ 49,327   $ 47,062   $ 30,155   $ 32,137    ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2010. Variable rate debt was approximately 1% of our total debt at December 31, 2010. ##TABLE_END Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the  Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Approximately 8% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts. Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for production goods, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation. Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2010, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2010, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $9.7 billion that extend through 2024. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Income Tax Obligations As of December 31, 2010, our total liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions, was $499 million, of which $81 million we expect to pay in the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining $418 million. Our income tax obligations are excluded from the table above. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2010. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Total Amounts Committed/Maximum Amount of Loss   Less than 1 year   1-3 Years   4-5 years   After 5 years  Standby letters of credit and surety bonds  $ 7,599   $ 5,560   $ 1,542   $ 328   $ 169  Commercial aircraft financing commitments   9,865    1,234    2,035    2,775    3,821  Total commercial commitments  $ 17,464   $ 6,794   $ 3,577   $ 3,103   $ 3,990    ##TABLE_END Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we currently do not anticipate that all of these commitments will be exercised by our customers; however there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contingent Obligations We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our contesting the default termination of the A-12 aircraft, certain employment and benefits litigation, litigation/arbitration involving BSSI programs and civil securities litigation relating to disclosures concerning the 787 program. Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $721 million at December 31, 2010. For additional information, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We have recorded a net liability of $1,198 million at December 31, 2010 for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of these contingencies, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized.  Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government. Generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. The development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. Estimates of each significant contracts sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS for all of 2010 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $319 million. A number of our contracts are in a reachforward loss position. Changes to estimated loss in future periods are recorded immediately in earnings. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling costs, and routine warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates, consistent with typical sales contract terms. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends.  To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower margins than established programs. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs, excluding the 747 and 787 programs, for all of 2010 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $261 million. The 747 program is in a reach-forward loss position having recorded a total of $2,037 million of reach-forward losses in 2009 and 2008. Absent changes in the estimated revenues or costs, subsequent deliveries are recorded at zero margin. Reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately. Our current assessment is that the 787 program does not have a reach-forward loss. The cumulative impacts of the production challenges, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts have created significant pressure on revenue and cost estimates such that we expect to record zero margin on the initial deliveries. The scale and duration of the 787 program is such that relatively minor changes in assumptions or variables could have a material effect on our reported results in any period if the program is determined to have a reach-forward loss. Aircraft Valuation Allowance for Losses on Customer Financing Receivables The allowance for losses on customer financing receivables (valuation provision) is used to provide for potential impairment of customer financing receivables in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the customer financing receivables portfolio. The estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including historical loss experience, collateral values, and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings, collateral values and default rates. If each customers credit rating were upgraded or downgraded by one major rating category at December 31, 2010, the allowance would have decreased by $163 million or increased by $343 million. If the collateral values were 20% higher or lower at December 31, 2010, the allowance would have decreased by $94 million or increased by $72 million. If the cumulative default rates used for each rating category should increase or decrease 1%, the allowance would have increased or decreased by $7 million. Impairment Review for Assets Under Operating Leases and Held for Re-Lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for re-lease when events or changes in  circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than its carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Had future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been 10% lower, we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Residual Values Equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease. Estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease. If the estimated residual values declined 20% at December 31, 2010, we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, and a future cumulative pre-tax earnings reduction of approximately $132 million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods, of which approximately $30 million would be recognized in 2011. Our investment in sales-type/finance leases includes future minimum lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of leased assets less unearned income. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other than temporary are recognized in the period in which the decline occurs. If the estimated residual values declined 20% at December 31, 2010, we estimate that we would have reduced pre-tax income by $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. April 1 is our annual testing date. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any. Changes in our forecasts or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future  periods. A 10% decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our operations would have no impact on the carrying value of goodwill. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $499 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would reduce the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets by less than $1 million. Postretirement Plans Almost all of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans with the exception of all nonunion and some union employees hired after December 31, 2008. We also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend rate (rate of growth for medical costs). Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligations and Shareholders equity. The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2010. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Change in discount rate Increase 25 bps   Change in discount rate Decrease 25 bps  Pension plans   Projected benefit obligation  $ (1,772 )  $ 2,204  Net periodic pension cost   (185 )   225  Other postretirement benefit plans   Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation   (192 )   228  Net periodic postretirement benefit cost   (15 )   17    ##TABLE_END Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2010 net periodic pension expense by $123 million. Differences between actual and expected returns can affect future years pension cost. The asset balance used to calculate the expected return on pension plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes changes in the fair value of assets over a five year period. Despite investment gains during 2010 and 2009, the significant losses incurred during 2008 will cause 2011 net periodic pension cost to increase by approximately $1.0 billion and the portion recognized in earnings for 2011 to increase by approximately $650 million primarily due to amortization of actuarial losses. Absent increases in interest rates, higher asset values and/or higher contributions, net periodic pension cost will increase further in future years.  The assumed medical trend rates have a significant effect on the following years expense, recorded liabilities and Shareholders equity. The following table shows the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 100 basis point change as of December 31, 2010. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Change in medical trend rate Increase 100 bps   Change in medical trend rate Decrease 100 bps  Other postretirement benefit plans   Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation  $ 742   $ (654 ) Net periodic postretirement benefit cost   125    (110 )   ##TABLE_END  ", "7A": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Exposure to this risk is managed by generally matching the profile of BCCs liabilities with that of BCCs assets in relation to amount and terms such as expected maturities and fixed versus floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2010, the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained rise in interest rates would be a $5 million increase to BCCs pre-tax earnings. For purposes of the foregoing sensitivity analysis, we assume that the level of our floating rate assets and debt (including the impact of derivatives) remain unchanged from year-end 2010 and that they are all subject to immediate re-pricing. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our investments or customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. Based on the portfolio of other Boeing fixed-rate debt, the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2010, a 10% increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized gains by $159 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our unrealized gains by $173 million. At December 31, 2009, a 10% increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized gains by $136 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our unrealized gains by $150 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.  ", "8": " Item 8.

The Boeing Company and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as Boeing, the Company, we, us, or our). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Use of Estimates Management makes assumptions and estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Those assumptions and estimates directly affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant estimates for which changes in the near term are considered reasonably possible and that may have a material impact on the financial statements are disclosed in these notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Cycle For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year and could exceed three years. Revenue and Related Cost Recognition Contract Accounting Contract accounting is used for development and production activities predominantly by Boeing Defense, Space  Security (BDS). The majority of business conducted by BDS is performed under contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that extend over several years. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract resulting in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. We combine contracts for accounting purposes when they are negotiated as a package with an overall profit margin objective, essentially represent an agreement to do a single project for a single customer, involve interrelated construction activities with substantial common costs, and are performed concurrently or sequentially. When a group of contracts is combined, revenue and profit are earned uniformly over the performance of the combined contracts. Sales related to fixed-price contracts are recognized as deliveries are made, except for certain fixed-price contracts that require substantial performance over an extended period before deliveries begin, for which sales are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones. Sales related to contracts in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if specified targets are achieved. Incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated and are probable are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded.  Program Accounting Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales related to its programs. Program accounting is applicable to products manufactured for delivery under production-type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contracts and years. Under program accounting, inventoriable production costs, program tooling costs, and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced, and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling, and routine warranty costs for the total program. We recognize sales for commercial airplane deliveries as each unit is completed and accepted by the customer. Sales recognized represent the price negotiated with the customer, adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. The amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Concession Sharing Arrangements We account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their purchase of products and services as a reduction to revenue when the related products and services are delivered. The sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendors products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products. Spare Parts Revenue We recognize sales of spare parts upon delivery and the amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost. Service Revenue Service revenue is recognized when the service is performed with the exception of U.S. government service agreements, which are accounted for using contract accounting. Service activities primarily include: support agreements associated with military aircraft and helicopter contracts, ongoing maintenance of International Space Station and Space Shuttle, commercial Delta launches and technical and flight operation services for commercial aircraft. Service revenue and associated cost of sales from pay-in-advance subscription fees are deferred and recognized as services are rendered. Financial Services Revenue We record financial services revenue associated with sales-type finance leases, operating leases, and notes receivable. Lease and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type finance leases, we record an asset at lease inception. This asset is recorded at the aggregate future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized as Cost of services in the period in which the declines occur.  For operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets, included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated residual value, using the straight-line method. Prepayments received on operating lease contracts are classified as Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. We periodically review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense. For notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note. Reinsurance Revenue Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Astro Ltd., participates in a reinsurance pool for workers compensation. The member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $139, $122 and $83 during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were $123, $118 and $86 during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Revenues and costs are presented net in Cost of services in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fleet Support We provide assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation to the operators of all our commercial airplane models. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, and technical consulting support. This activity continues throughout the aircrafts operational life. Services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire models fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services. Research and Development Research and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design, testing, and bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers. Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with our contract accounting policy. We have certain research and development arrangements that meet the requirement for best efforts research and development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expense rather than as contract revenues. We have established cost sharing arrangements with some suppliers for the 787 program. Our cost sharing arrangements state that the supplier contributions are for reimbursements of costs we incur for experimentation, basic design, and testing activities during the 787 development. In each arrangement, we retain substantial rights to the 787 part or component covered by the arrangement. The amounts received from these cost sharing arrangements are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses since we have no obligation to refund any amounts received per the arrangements regardless of the outcome of the development efforts. Specifically, under the terms of each agreement, payments received from suppliers for their share of the costs are typically based on  milestones and are recognized as earned when we achieve the milestone events and no ongoing obligation on our part exists. In the event we receive a milestone payment prior to the completion of the milestone, the amount is classified in Other accrued liabilities until earned. Share-Based Compensation We provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value net of estimated forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. Income Taxes Provisions for federal, state, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Earnings before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. Tax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of Income tax expense. Postretirement Plans Almost all of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans with the exception of all nonunion and some union employees hired after December 31, 2008. We also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employees annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). A portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and reflected in inventory at the end of a reporting period. If gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities we amortize them over the average future service period of employees. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Effective December 31, 2008, accounting standards required us to measure our plan assets and benefit obligations at December 31, the date of our year end. We previously performed this measurement at September 30 of each year.  Postemployment Plans We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated. Environmental Remediation We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations, and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup, and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be able to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank, and reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable were $209 and $211 at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Inventories Inventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe benefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries and plant services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costs include amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one year. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative commercial airplane program, the actual costs incurred for production of the early units in the program may exceed the amount reported as cost of sales for those units. In addition, the application of a total program gross profit rate to delivered units may result in costs assigned to delivered units in a reporting period being less than the actual cost of those units. The excess actual costs incurred over the amount reported as cost of sales is disclosed as deferred production costs, which are included in inventory along with unamortized tooling costs. The determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision is recorded. The determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimate revenue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting  quantity. When estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. Used aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value. See Aircraft Valuation within this Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or market. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired inventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs. Included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the ability to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwise recoverable, it would be written off in the current period. We net advances and progress billings on long-term contracts against inventory in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Advances and progress billings in excess of related inventory are reported in Advances and billings in excess of related costs. Precontract Costs We may, from time to time, incur costs to begin fulfilling the statement of work under a specific anticipated contract that we are still negotiating with a customer. If we determine it is probable that we will be awarded the specific anticipated contract, then we capitalize the precontract costs we incur, excluding start-up costs which are expensed as incurred. Capitalized precontract costs of $527 and $183 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, are included in Inventories, net of advances and progress billings, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and equipment, from 3 to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over five years. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition. Long-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Long-lived assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.  Asset Retirement Obligations We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material. We also have known conditional asset retirement obligations, such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liabilitys fair value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology, from 3 to 14 years; product know-how, from 3 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 19 years; distribution rights, from 9 to 30 years; and other, from 2 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Investments We classify investment securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities include time deposits and are carried at cost. Available-for-sale securities include marketable debt and equity securities and Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates and are recorded at their fair values, with unrealized gains and losses reported as part of Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Realized gains and losses on marketable securities are recognized based on the cost of securities  using the first-in, first-out method. Realized gains and losses on all other available-for-sale securities are recognized based on specific identification. Available-for-sale securities are assessed for impairment quarterly. The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between 20% and 50%. We classify investment income and loss on our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on whether the investment is operating or non-operating in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, including our share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from certain cost method investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic purposes. Earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on marketable securities, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in Other income/(expense), net. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them. We use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes in fair value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is to include in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For our cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported in Shareholders equity (as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss of a cash flow hedge is reported in earnings immediately. We also hold certain instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For these derivative instruments, the changes in their fair value are also recorded in earnings immediately. Aircraft Valuation Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into specified-price trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that no contingent repurchase agreements have become trade-in commitments.  All trade-in commitments at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were solely attributable to Sale Aircraft and did not originate from contingent repurchase agreements. Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of: ##TABLE_START  (1)  adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recorded in Inventory and recognized upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  (2)  charges to cost of products for adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in Other accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_END The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customers requirements; or the scrap market. Trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market. This quarterly valuation process yields results that are typically lower than residual value estimates by independent sources and tends to more accurately reflect results upon the actual placement of the aircraft. Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or market as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer financing. Assets under operating lease, assets held for sale or re-lease and collateral underlying receivables Customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivables, and sales-type/financing leases. Sales-type/financing leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary. We assess the fair value of the assets we own, including equipment under operating leases, assets held for sale or re-lease, and collateral underlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are less than the related assets carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fair values of finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables. We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications. Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected  undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. We state assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Allowance for losses on customer financing receivables We record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in our portfolio in a valuation account, the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivables portfolio. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to two components of receivables: (a) specifically identified receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables. We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the receivable agreement, without regard to any subsequent restructurings. Factors considered in assessing collectibility include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. We determine a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral. We review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables (after excluding receivables subject to a specific impairment allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for each customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, for example, permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall. Each quarter we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables. Warranties In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material and design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a three  to four-year standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards under our authorization. These warranties are included in the programs estimate at completion. On occasion we have made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warranties issued by our BDS segments principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons hardware and are included in the contract cost estimates. These sales are generally accompanied by a six to twelve-month warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate. Supplier Penalties We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully anticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts. Guarantees We record a liability in Other accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. For a residual value guarantee where we received a cash premium, the liability is equal to the cash premium received at the guarantees inception. For credit and performance guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditors default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable, for each future period the credit or performance guarantee will be outstanding. If at inception of a guarantee, we determine there is a probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value of the guarantee as described above or (b) the probable contingent loss amount. Note 2  Acquisitions Argon ST, Inc. On August 5, 2010, we acquired Argon ST, Inc. (Argon) for $782, net of cash acquired. Argon develops command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) and, combat systems. The acquisition is part of our strategy to expand our capabilities to address the C4ISR, cyber and intelligence markets. Argons results of operations from the acquisition date are included in the Network  Space Systems (NSS) segment. We also expect to generate synergies associated with the acquisition in other Boeing Defense, Space  Security business units. Goodwill has been recorded in NSS, Global Services  Support (GSS) and Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA) segments.  The final allocation of the purchase price is as follows: ##TABLE_START Accounts receivable  $ 66  Inventory   47  Property, plant and equipment   32  Goodwill   549  Finite-lived intangible assets (1)   216  Other assets   1  Accounts payable   (14 ) Other accrued liabilities   (69 ) Advances and billings in excess of related costs   (8 ) Deferred income taxes   (38 ) Total net assets acquired  $ 782    ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Finite-lived intangible assets have a weighted average amortization period of 13 years and include $133 of Developed technology and $69 of Customer base. ##TABLE_END Vought Aircraft Industries Inc. On July 30, 2009, we acquired the business, assets and operations of Vought Aircraft Industries, Inc.s (Vought) 787 business conducted at North Charleston, South Carolina. In connection with the acquisition, we paid cash consideration of $590 and released Vought from its obligation to repay amounts of $416 previously advanced by us. Voughts 787 business produces aft fuselage sections, including the fabrication, assembly and systems installation, for the 787 program. The acquisition of Vought is intended to strengthen our 787 program and bolster our capability to develop and produce large composite structures. The results of operations from the acquisition date are included in our Commercial Airplanes segment.

Estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding years is as follows: 2011  $192; 2012  $190; 2013  $170; 2014  $156 and 2015  $149. Non-cash investing and financing transactions related to acquired finite-lived intangibles during 2010 and 2009 were $62 and $329. Total acquired finite-lived intangibles of $529 and $604 remain unpaid as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.  Note 4  Earnings Per Share The weighted-average number of shares outstanding used to compute earnings per share are as follows: ##TABLE_START (Shares in millions) Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Weighted average shares outstanding   735.0    705.9    719.9  Participating securities   3.1    3.7    2.9  Basic weighted average shares outstanding   738.1    709.6    722.8  Dilutive potential common shares   6.2    3.8    6.2  Diluted weighted average shares outstanding   744.3    713.4    729.0    ##TABLE_END Basic earnings per share is calculated by the sum of (1) net earnings less declared dividends and dividend equivalents related to share-based compensation divided by the basic weighted average shares outstanding and (2) declared dividends and dividend equivalents related to share-based compensation divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. The weighted average number of shares outstanding, included in the table below, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the average market price did not exceed the exercise/threshold price. However, these shares may be dilutive potential common shares in the future. ##TABLE_START (Shares in millions) Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Stock options   14.9    16.8    14.9  Performance Awards   3.8    2.0    2.0  ShareValue Trust    13.2    12.7  Performance Shares    0.8    0.7  Stock units    0.2    0.3    ##TABLE_END Note 5  Income Taxes The components of earnings before income taxes were: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  U.S.  $ 4,310   $ 1,638   $ 3,794  Non-U.S.   197    93    201  Total  $ 4,507   $ 1,731   $ 3,995    ##TABLE_END Income tax expense/(benefit) consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Current tax expense    U.S. federal  $ 13   $ (132 )  $ 44  Non-U.S.   80    69    29  U.S. state   (137 )   145    20  Total current   (44 )   82    93  Deferred tax expense    U.S. federal   969    457    1,151  Non-U.S.   (13 )   (55 )   26  U.S. state   284    (88 )   71  Total deferred   1,240    314    1,248  Total income tax expense  $ 1,196   $ 396   $ 1,341    ##TABLE_END  Net income tax payments/(refunds) were $360, ($198) and $599 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our effective income tax rate was 26.5%, 22.9% and 33.6% for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our effective tax rate was higher in 2010, than 2009, primarily because pre-tax book income in 2010 was higher than in 2009 and because of an income tax charge of $150 recorded during the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. This was partially offset by a tax benefit of $371 recorded during the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of settling the 1998-2003 federal audit. Our effective tax rate was lower in 2009, than 2008, primarily because tax credits such as research and development credits represented a higher proportion of earnings before taxes due to the year-over-year reduction in earnings. The following is a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% to our effective income tax rate: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  U.S. federal statutory tax   35.0 %   35.0 %   35.0 % Research and development credits   (3.5 )   (10.1 )   (4.3 ) Tax on international activities   (1.2 )   (2.4 )   (0.7 ) Tax deductible dividends   (0.9 )   (2.2 )   (0.8 ) State income tax provision, net of effect on U.S. federal tax   1.8    2.2    1.7  Medicare Part D law change   3.3    Federal audit settlement   (8.2 )   Other provision adjustments   0.2    0.4    2.7  Effective income tax rate   26.5 %   22.9 %   33.6 %   ##TABLE_END Significant components of our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009  Retiree health care accruals  $ 3,061   $ 2,930  Inventory and long-term contract methods of income recognition, fixed assets and other (net of valuation allowance of $27 and $23)   (2,644 )   (994 ) Partnerships and joint ventures   (263 )   (528 ) Other employee benefits accruals   1,272    1,411  In-process research and development related to acquisitions   65    79  Net operating loss, credit and capital loss carryovers (net of valuation allowance of $78 and $36)   300    477  Pension asset   3,443    2,345  Customer and commercial financing   (1,645 )   (1,703 ) Unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries   (60 )   (55 ) Other net unrealized losses   13    66  Net deferred tax assets (1)  $ 3,542   $ 4,028    ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Of the deferred tax asset for net operating loss and credit carryovers, $158 expires in years ending from December 31, 2011 through December 31, 2030 and $142 may be carried over indefinitely. ##TABLE_END  Net deferred tax assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009  Deferred tax assets  $ 14,383   $ 13,739  Deferred tax liabilities   (10,736 )   (9,652 ) Valuation allowance   (105 )    (59 ) Net deferred tax assets  $ 3,542   $ 4,028    ##TABLE_END The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Included in the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are deferred tax assets in the amounts of $8,186 and $7,226 related to other comprehensive loss. We have provided for U.S. deferred income taxes and foreign withholding tax in the amount of $60 on undistributed earnings not considered permanently reinvested in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding tax on the remainder of undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested and it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that may be payable upon distribution. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the amount accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position was as follows: interest of $170 and $271 and penalties of $12 and $14. The amount of interest (benefit)/expense was ($105), $45 and $43 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The interest benefit recorded during 2010 was primarily related to the 1998-2003 federal audit settlement. The years 2007-2008 are currently being examined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and we have filed appeals with the IRS for 2004-2006. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2001-2010 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009   2008  Unrecognized tax benefits  January 1  $ 1,787   $ 1,453   $ 1,272  Gross increases  tax positions in prior periods   95    219    88  Gross decreases  tax positions in prior periods   (465 )   (31 )   (28 ) Gross increases  current-period tax positions   76    148    132  Gross decreases  current-period tax positions   (40 )   Settlements   (254 )    (10 ) Lapse of statute of limitations   (1 )    (2 )   (1 ) Unrecognized tax benefits  December 31  $ 1,198   $ 1,787   $ 1,453    ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1,198, $1,787 and $1,453 of which $1,074, $1,452 and $1,171 would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. These amounts are primarily associated with U.S. federal tax issues such as the tax benefits from the Foreign Sales Corporation/Extraterritorial Income tax rules, the amount of research and development tax credits claimed, U.S. taxation of foreign earnings, and valuation issues regarding charitable contributions claimed. Also included in these amounts are accruals for domestic state tax issues such as the allocation of income among various state tax jurisdictions and the amount of state tax credits claimed.  Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will resolve some or all of the matters presently under consideration for 2004-2006 with the IRS. Depending on the timing and outcome of the audit settlement, unrecognized tax benefits that affect the effective tax rate could increase earnings by up to $300 based on current estimates. The research and development credit expired on December 31, 2009. On December 17, 2010, President Obama signed into law, the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 that retroactively renews the research and development tax credit for 2010 and extends the credit through December 31, 2011. Note 6  Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009  U.S. government contracts  $ 2,969   $ 3,090  Commercial customers   1,241    1,206  Reinsurance receivables   487    494  Non-U.S. military contracts   514    436  Sea Launch receivables, net of reserves (1)    438  Other   253    162  Less valuation allowance   (42 )   (41 ) Total  $ 5,422   $ 5,785    ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  During 2010, the Sea Launch receivables were reclassified from Accounts receivable to Other assets. See discussion below. ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes our accounts receivable under long-term contracts that were not billable or related to outstanding claims as of December 31: ##TABLE_START    Unbillable   Claims     2010   2009   2010   2009  Current  $ 994   $ 1,273   $ 30   $ 33  Expected to be collected after one year   507    450    194    151  Total  $ 1,501   $ 1,723   $ 224   $ 184    ##TABLE_END Under contract accounting unbillable receivables on long-term contracts arise when the sales or revenues based on performance attainment, though appropriately recognized, cannot be billed yet under terms of the contract as of the balance sheet date. Any adjustment for the credit quality of unbillable receivables, if required, would be recorded as a direct reduction of revenue. Factors considered in assessing the collectibility of unbillable receivables include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. Unbillable receivables related to commercial customers expected to be collected after one year were $213 and $158 at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Accounts receivable related to claims are items that we believe are earned, but are subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate realization. Accounts receivable, other than those described above, expected to be collected after one year are not material.  Sea Launch At December 31, 2010, Other assets included $356 of receivables, previously recorded as Accounts receivable, related to our former investment in the Sea Launch venture which became payable by certain Sea Launch partners following Sea Launchs bankruptcy filing in June 2009. The $356 includes $147 related to a payment made by us under a bank guarantee on behalf of Sea Launch and $209 related to loans we made to Sea Launch. The net amounts owed to Boeing by each of the partners are as follows; S.P. Koroley Rocket and Space Corporation Energia of Russia  $223, PO Yuzhnoye Mashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukraine  $89 and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine  $44. Although each partner is contractually obligated to reimburse us for its share of the bank guarantee, the Russian and Ukrainian partners have raised defenses to enforcement and contested our claims. On October 19, 2009, we filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launch partners of the $147 bank guarantee payment. On October 7, 2010, the arbitrator ruled that the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter but did not resolve the merits of our claim. We filed a notice appealing the arbitrators ruling on January 11, 2011. We believe the partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and remedies. In the event we are unable to secure reimbursement of $147 related to our payment under the bank guarantee and $209 related to loans made to Sea Launch, we could incur additional pre-tax charges of up to $356. Note 7  Inventories Inventories at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009  Long-term contracts in progress  $ 14,400   $ 14,673  Commercial aircraft programs   26,550    18,568  Commercial spare parts, used aircraft, general stock materials and other   5,788    5,004  Inventory before advances and progress billings   46,738    38,245  Less advances and progress billings   (22,421 )   (21,312 ) Total  $ 24,317   $ 16,933    ##TABLE_END Long-Term Contracts in Progress Long-term contracts in progress included Delta launch program inventory that will be sold at cost to United Launch Alliance (ULA) under an inventory supply agreement that terminates on March 31, 2021. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the inventory balance was $1,385 and $1,685. As of December 31, 2010, $1,070 of this inventory relates to yet unsold launches. ULA is continuing to assess the future of the Delta II program. In the event ULA is unable to sell additional Delta II inventory, our earnings could be reduced by up to $70. See Note 12. Inventory balances included $236 and $235 subject to claims or other uncertainties relating to the A-12 program as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. See Note 20. Commercial Aircraft Programs As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 787 program: $9,461 and $3,885 of work in process (including deferred production costs), $1,956 and $2,187 of supplier advances, and $1,447 and $1,231 of tooling and other non-recurring costs.  Commercial aircraft programs inventory included $319 and $510 of deferred production cost, and $170 and $211 of unamortized tooling for the 777 program, at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Commercial aircraft program inventory included amounts credited in cash or other consideration (early issue sales consideration), to airline customers totaling $1,970 and $1,577 at December 31, 2010 and 2009. As a normal course of our Commercial Airplanes segment production process, our inventory may include a small quantity of airplanes that are completed but unsold. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the value of completed but unsold aircraft in inventory was insignificant. Note 8  Customer Financing Customer financing at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009  Financing receivables   Investment in sales-type/finance leases  $ 2,272   $ 2,391  Notes   480    1,008  Operating lease equipment, at cost, less accumulated depreciation of $847 and $784   2,281    2,737  Gross customer financing  $ 5,033   $ 6,136  Less allowance for losses on receivables   (353 )   (302 ) Total  $ 4,680   $ 5,834    ##TABLE_END The components of investment in sales-type/finance leases at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009  Minimum lease payments receivable  $ 2,879   $ 3,147  Estimated residual value of leased assets   619    677  Unearned income   (1,226 )   (1,433 ) Total  $ 2,272   $ 2,391    ##TABLE_END Operating lease equipment primarily includes jet and commuter aircraft. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, operating lease equipment included $583 and $385 of equipment available for sale or re-lease. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had firm lease commitments for $28 and $345 of this equipment. When our Commercial Airplanes segment is unable to immediately sell used aircraft, it may place the aircraft under an operating lease. It may also provide customer financing with a note receivable. The carrying amount of the Commercial Airplanes segment used aircraft under operating leases and notes receivable included as a component of customer financing totaled $167 and $203 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Financing receivable balances evaluated for impairment are as follows: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009  Individually evaluated for impairment  $ 99   $ 270  Collectively evaluated for impairment   2,653    3,129  Total financing receivables  $ 2,752   $ 3,399    ##TABLE_END  At December 31, 2010, we had no impaired financing receivables. Impaired financing receivables, unpaid principal balances, and the allowance for losses on those receivables consisted of the following at December 31, 2009: ##TABLE_START           No specific impairment allowance   $ 1  Specific impairment allowance       144  Carrying value of impaired receivables   $ 145    Unpaid principal balance   $ 145  Allowance for losses on impaired receivables       2  ##TABLE_END The average recorded investment in impaired financing receivables as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, was $88, $162 and $197, respectively. Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Income is recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer. Interest income recognized on such receivables was $9, $9 and $14 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The change in the allowance for losses on financing receivables for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009   2008  Beginning balance  January 1  $ (302 )  $ (269 )  $ (195 ) Customer financing valuation benefit/(provision)   (51 )   (45 )   (84 ) Reduction in customer financing assets       12    10  Ending balance  December 31  $ (353 )  $ (302 )  $ (269 )   Specifically evaluated for impairment   $ (2 )  $ (8 ) Collectively evaluated for impairment  $ (353 )   (300 )   (261 )   ##TABLE_END We assign internal credit ratings for all customers and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We utilize these credit ratings as one of the factors in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for losses on receivables. Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies. Credit risk profile by internally assigned ratings, consisted of the following at December 31: ##TABLE_START Rating categories  2010   2009  B  $ 207   $ 510  CCC   2,432    2,746  Other   113    143  Total carrying value of financing receivables  $ 2,752   $ 3,399    ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2010 and 2009, all of our receivables were related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we applied default rates, on average, of 11% and 51% for customers with internally assigned B and CCC ratings. Declines in collateral values are a significant driver of our allowance for losses. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have had greater percentages of collateral value declines than in-production aircraft. Our portfolio is primarily comprised of financing receivables for out-of-production aircraft. As of December 31, 2010, we had no past due receivables. As of December 31, 2009, total financing receivables past due thirty days or more was $1.  Customer Financing Exposure Customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance and may be subject to reduced valuation with market decline. Our Customer financing portfolio has a concentration of various model aircraft. Customer financing carrying values related to major aircraft concentrations at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009  717 Aircraft ($561 and $662 accounted for as operating leases) (1)  $ 2,070   $ 2,262  757 Aircraft ($629 and $708 accounted for as operating leases) (1)   720    902  737 Aircraft ($317 and $400 accounted for as operating leases)   366    553  767 Aircraft ($115 and $154 accounted for as operating leases)   372    465  MD-11 Aircraft ($327 and $384 accounted for as operating leases) (1)   327    384    ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Out of production aircraft ##TABLE_END Charges related to customer financing asset impairment for the years ended December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009   2008  Boeing Capital Corporation  $ 85   $ 91   $ 35  Other Boeing   85    8      Total  $ 170   $ 99   $ 35    ##TABLE_END Scheduled receipts on customer financing are as follows: ##TABLE_START Year  2011   2012   2013   2014   2015   Beyond 2015  Principal payments on notes receivable  $ 170   $ 98   $ 138   $ 23   $ 25   $ 26  Sales-type/finance lease payments receivable   319    317    274    274    273    1,422  Operating lease equipment payments receivable   292    231    184    141    120    200    ##TABLE_END Customer financing assets leased under capital leases and subleased to others were not significant in 2010 and 2009.

Interest capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 totaled $48, $90 and $99, respectively.  Rental expense for leased properties was $269, $273 and $426, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For the same periods, these expenses, substantially all minimum rentals, were net of sublease income of $6, $9 and $14, respectively. At December 31, 2010, minimum rental payments under capital leases aggregated $143. Minimum rental payments under operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more aggregated $1,159, net of sublease payments of $4, at December 31, 2010. Non-cancellable future rentals due from customers for equipment on operating leases aggregated $121 at December 31, 2010.

It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and the discovery of additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios which include highest cost estimates for all remediation sites based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our reasonably possible highest cost estimate for all remediation sites exceeded our recorded liabilities by $957 and $948. Product Warranties The following table summarizes product warranty activity recorded for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. ##TABLE_START    2010   2009  Beginning balance  January 1  $ 999   $ 959  Additions for current year deliveries   141    167  Reductions for payments made   (234 )   (237 ) Changes in estimates   170    110  Ending balance  December 31  $ 1,076   $ 999    ##TABLE_END Discontinued Operations As part of the 2004 purchase and sale agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation related to the sale of Boeing Capital Corporations (BCC) Commercial Financial Services business, BCC is involved in a loss sharing arrangement for losses on transferred portfolio assets, such as asset sales, provisions for loss or asset impairment charges offset by gains from asset sales. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our maximum future cash exposure to losses associated with the loss sharing arrangement was $232 and $234 and our accrued liability under the loss sharing arrangement was $82 and $77. Commercial Aircraft Commitments In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into specified-price trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. The total contractual trade-in value was $295 and $427 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. We anticipate that a significant portion of these commitments will not be exercised by customers. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is continually assessed, taking into consideration the current economic environment. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer. The estimated fair value of trade-in aircraft related to probable contractual trade-in commitments was $30 and $34 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Trade-in commitment agreements have expiration dates from 2011 through 2023.  Future Lease Commitments As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, future lease commitments on aircraft and other commitments not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position totaled $17 and $159. These lease commitments extend through 2015, and our intent is to recover these lease commitments through sublease arrangements. As of December 31, 2010, the future lease commitments on aircraft for each of the next five years were as follows: $3 in 2011, $3 in 2012, $3 in 2013, $3 in 2014, and $3 in 2015. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, Other accrued liabilities included $12 and $14 attributable to adverse commitments under these lease arrangements. Financing Commitments Financing commitments totaled $9,865 and $10,409 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. We anticipate that a significant portion of these commitments will not be exercised by the customers as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. We have entered into standby letters of credit agreements and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $7,599 and $7,052 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. In connection with the formation of ULA, we and Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) each committed to provide up to $200 to support its working capital requirements through December 1, 2011. ULA did not request any funds under the commitment as of December 31, 2010. We and Lockheed have also each committed to provide ULA with up to $232 of additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. See Note 7. C-17 At December 31, 2010, our backlog included 6 C-17 aircraft currently under contract with the U.S. Air Force (USAF) as well as international orders for 6 C-17 aircraft. At December 31, 2010, we have approximately $620 of inventory expenditures and potential termination liabilities to suppliers associated primarily with 10 aircraft funded in the Fiscal Year 2010 (FY10) Defense Appropriations Act which are not currently under contract. The Presidents Fiscal Year 2011 budget announced during the first quarter of 2010 did not include any additional C-17 aircraft. During the first quarter of 2010 we announced plans to reduce the production rate from 15 per year to 10 per year and expect the transition to be complete by mid-2011. The lower production rate is intended to bridge the gap between existing orders and potential future orders. Should additional orders not materialize, it is reasonably possible that we will decide in 2011 to end production of the C-17 at a future date. We are still evaluating the full financial impact of a potential production shut-down, including any recovery that would be available from the U.S. government. Such recovery from the U.S. government would not include the costs incurred by us resulting from our direction to suppliers to begin working on aircraft beyond those currently under contract with the USAF. Company Owned Life Insurance McDonnell Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life insurance policies with a cash surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of  December 31, 2010 and 2009, the cash surrender value was $381 and $360 and the total loans were $363 and $337. As we have the right to offset the loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Note 12  Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees. Third-Party Guarantees The following tables provide quantitative data regarding our third-party guarantees. The maximum potential payments represent a worst-case scenario, and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset our payments under guarantees. ##TABLE_START    Maximum Potential Payments   Estimated Proceeds from Collateral/ Recourse   Carrying Amount of Liabilities (1)  December 31,  2010   2009   2010   2009   2010   2009  Contingent repurchase commitments  $ 3,782   $ 3,958   $ 3,759   $ 3,940   $ 7   $ 7  Indemnifications to ULA:       Contributed Delta program launch inventory   187    277      Contract pricing   261    348      7    7  Other Delta contracts   83    57      16    16  Other credit guarantees   71    119    63    109    6    2  Residual value guarantees   29    51    21    44    6    10    ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Amounts included in Other accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_END Contingent Repurchase Commitments We have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers in conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft. Under these commitments, we agreed to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and the subsequent exercise by the customer of its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us. The repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase commitments is generally lower than the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated Proceeds from Collateral/Recourse in the tables above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date. Indemnifications to ULA We agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 of Boeing Delta launch program inventory included in contributed assets plus $1,860 of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021. Since inception, ULA has consumed $1,201 of inventory that was contributed by us. ULA has made advance payments of $420 to us and we have recorded revenues and cost of sales of $166 under the inventory supply agreement through December 31, 2010. ULA is continuing to assess the future of the Delta II program beyond what is currently on contract. In the event ULA is unable to sell additional Delta II inventory, our earnings could be reduced by up to $70.  We agreed to indemnify ULA against potential losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the USAF for four satellite missions. We believe ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing. In December 2008, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value for two satellite missions. In March 2009, the USAF issued a denial of that claim and in June 2009, ULA filed an appeal. During 2009, the USAF exercised its option for a third satellite mission. During the third quarter of 2010, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value of the third mission. The USAF did not exercise an option for a fourth mission prior to expiration. If ULA is unsuccessful in obtaining additional pricing, we may be responsible for a portion of the shortfall and may record up to $283 in pre-tax losses associated with the three missions, representing up to $261 for the indemnification payment and up to $22 for our portion of additional contract losses incurred by ULA. Other Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees, principally to facilitate the sale and/or financing of commercial aircraft. Under these arrangements, we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that lease or loan payments are not made by the original lessee or debtor or certain specified services are not performed. A substantial portion of these guarantees has been extended on behalf of original lessees or debtors with less than investment-grade credit. Our commercial aircraft credit guarantees are collateralized by the underlying commercial aircraft and certain other assets. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire within the next ten years. Residual Value Guarantees We have issued various residual value guarantees principally to facilitate the sale and financing of certain commercial aircraft. Under these guarantees, we are obligated to make payments to the guaranteed party if the related aircraft or equipment fair values fall below a specified amount at a future time. These obligations are collateralized principally by the underlying commercial aircraft and expire within the next eight years. Other Indemnifications In conjunction with our sales of the Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and the sale of our Commercial Airplanes facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma in 2005, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental contamination and certain other items. As it is impossible to assess whether there will be damages in the future or the amounts thereof (if any), we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities. Therefore, no liability has been recorded. There have been no claims submitted to date. Industrial Revenue Bonds Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRBs) issued by the City of Wichita are used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property at our Wichita site. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a ten-year property tax abatement and a sales tax exemption from the Kansas Department of Revenue. We record the property on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, along with a capital lease obligation to repay the proceeds of the IRB. We have also purchased the IRBs and therefore are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the property purchased with the IRB proceeds. The capital lease obligation and IRB asset are recorded net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the net assets associated with the City of Wichita IRBs were $822 and $856.  Note 13  Debt Total debt interest incurred, including amounts capitalized, was $729, $610 and $520 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest expense recorded by BCC is reflected as a separate line item on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and is included in earnings from operations. Total Company interest payments were $670, $502 and $493 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We have $4,376 currently available under credit line agreements, of which $2,000 is a five-year credit facility expiring in November 2012 and $ 2,376 is a 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in November 2011. Both the five-year and 364-day credit facilities have a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration dates. We have given BCC exclusive access to $1,500 under these arrangements. We continue to be in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt or credit facility agreements, including those at BCC. Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009     Consolidated Total   BCC Only   Consolidated Total   BCC Only  Unsecured debt securities  $ 785   $ 785   $ 644   $ 644  Non-recourse debt and notes   79    6    24    6  Capital lease obligations   62    10    14    9  Other notes   22        25      Total  $ 948   $ 801   $ 707   $ 659    ##TABLE_END Debt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009  Boeing Capital Corporation debt:   Unsecured debt securities   1.53%  7.58% due through 2023  $ 3,339   $ 3,952  Non-recourse debt and notes   1.37%  5.79% notes due through 2013   55    61  Capital lease obligations   0.92% due through 2015   52    62  Boeing Capital Corporation debt subtotal  $ 3,446   $ 4,075  Other Boeing debt:   Unsecured debentures and notes   1.88%  5.00% due through 2020  $ 3,376   $ 3,372  5.88%  6.88% due through 2043   2,988    2,987  7.25%  9.75% due through 2043   1,991    1,990  Non-recourse debt and notes   Enhanced equipment trust   342    360  Capital lease obligations due through 2017   135    14  Other notes   143    126  Other Boeing debt subtotal  $ 8,975   $ 8,849  Total debt  $ 12,421   $ 12,924    ##TABLE_END  Other Boeing debt includes $300 bearing an interest rate of 7.95% due August 15, 2024 that may be redeemed at the holders option on August 15, 2012. At December 31, 2010, $107 of BCC debt was collateralized by portfolio assets and underlying equipment totaling $186. The debt consists of the 0.92% to 5.79% notes due through 2015. Scheduled principal payments for debt and capital lease obligations for the next five years are as follows: ##TABLE_START    2011   2012   2013   2014   2015  Boeing Capital Corporation  $ 798   $ 878   $ 652   $ 526   $ 16  Other Boeing   141    1,420    657    770    821  Total  $ 939   $ 2,298   $ 1,309   $ 1,296   $ 837    ##TABLE_END Note 14  Postretirement Plans Almost all of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans, with the exception of all nonunion and some union employees hired after December 31, 2008. We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans participants, and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long term with the growth of obligations for future benefit payments. We also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for approximately half those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered by most United Auto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage. The funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). We have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Pension plan assets, net, and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in Other accrued liabilities. The components of net periodic benefit cost are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Pension   Other Postretirement Benefits  Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008   2010   2009   2008  Service cost  $ 1,176   $ 1,090   $ 952   $ 121   $ 132   $ 126  Interest cost   3,002    2,964    2,823    404    466    459  Expected return on plan assets   (3,850 )   (3,738 )   (3,811 )   (6 )   (5 )   (8 ) Amortization of prior service costs   248    242    206    (78 )   (90 )   (93 ) Recognized net actuarial loss   777    650    392    56    92    86  Settlement/curtailment/transfer loss   14    13                  Net periodic benefit cost  $ 1,367   $ 1,221   $ 562   $ 497   $ 595   $ 570    Net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations  $ 1,101   $ 879   $ 696   $ 480   $ 615   $ 507    ##TABLE_END  A portion of net periodic benefit cost is allocated to production as product costs and may remain in inventory at the end of each reporting period. The following tables show changes in the benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status of both pensions and OPB for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Benefit obligation balances presented below reflect the PBO for our pension plans, and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations (APBO) for our OPB plans. ##TABLE_START    Pension   Other Postretirement Benefits     2010   2009   2010   2009  Change in benefit obligation     Beginning balance  $ 52,166   $ 49,017   $ 7,576   $ 7,859  Service cost   1,176    1,090    121    132  Interest cost   3,002    2,964    404    466  Plan participants contributions   9    9    Amendments   142    143    (130 )   (18 ) Actuarial (gain)/loss   5,243    1,445    1,061    (374 ) Settlement/curtailment/acquisitions/ dispositions, net   (93 )   (68 )   32   Gross benefits paid   (2,567 )   (2,515 )   (555 )   (541 ) Medicare Part D subsidy     31    30  Exchange rate adjustment   28    81    6    22  Ending balance  $ 59,106   $ 52,166   $ 8,546   $ 7,576    Change in plan assets     Beginning balance at fair value  $ 45,810   $ 40,597   $ 89   $ 79  Actual return on plan assets   5,979    6,074    11    13  Company contribution   35    1,582    15    24  Plan participants contributions   9    9    2    2  Settlement/curtailment/acquisitions/ dispositions, net   (98 )   (67 )    (1 ) Benefits paid   (2,507 )   (2,459 )   (19 )   (28 ) Exchange rate adjustment   24    74          Ending balance at fair value  $ 49,252   $ 45,810   $ 98   $ 89    Amounts recognized in statement of financial position at December 31 consist of:     Pension plan assets, net  $ 6   $ 16    Other accrued liabilities   (60 )   (57 )  $ (423 )  $ (438 ) Accrued retiree health care     (8,025 )   (7,049 ) Accrued pension plan liability, net   (9,800 )   (6,315 )         Net amount recognized  $ (9,854 )  $ (6,356 )  $ (8,448 )  $ (7,487 )   ##TABLE_END Amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Pensions   Other Postretirement Benefits     2010   2009   2010   2009  Net actuarial loss  $ 19,343   $ 17,012   $ 2,148   $ 1,197  Prior service cost/(credit)   1,225    1,331    (384 )   (332 ) Total recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss  $ 20,568   $ 18,343   $ 1,764   $ 865    ##TABLE_END  The estimated amount that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during the year ended December 31, 2011 is as follows: ##TABLE_START    Pensions   Other Postretirement Benefits  Recognized net actuarial loss  $ 1,252   $ 132  Amortization of prior service costs   250    (96 ) Total  $ 1,502   $ 36    ##TABLE_END The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for all pension plans was $53,513 and $47,549 at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Key information for our plans with ABO in excess of plan assets as of December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009  Projected benefit obligation  $ 58,772   $ 26,141  Accumulated benefit obligation   53,202    24,227  Fair value of plan assets   48,926    22,205    ##TABLE_END The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 reduced our APBO by $60 and $497 at December 31, 2010 and 2009. These reductions/actuarial gains are amortized over the expected average future service of current employees. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 increased our APBO by $300 at December 31, 2010. This includes the impact of the excise tax on high cost health plans scheduled to become payable beginning in 2018. This increase is recognized as an actuarial loss and is amortized over the expected future service of current employees. Assumptions The following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31 of each year and the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year. ##TABLE_START December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Discount rate:    Pension   5.30 %   5.80 %   6.10 % Other postretirement benefits   4.90 %   5.40 %   6.00 % Expected return on plan assets   7.75 %   8.00 %   8.00 % Rate of compensation increase   5.20 %   5.50 %   5.50 %   ##TABLE_END The discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high quality bonds that are rated as Aa or better by Moodys as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yields developed from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. A portfolio of about 400 bonds is used to construct the yield curve. Since corporate bond yields are generally not available at maturities beyond 30 years, it is assumed that spot rates will remain level beyond that 30-year point. The present value of each plans benefits is calculated by applying the spot/discount rates to projected benefit cash flows. All bonds are U.S. issues, with a minimum outstanding of $50.  The pension funds expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the upcoming plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five-year moving average of plan assets. As of December 31, 2010, the MRVA is approximately $450 greater than the fair market value of assets. Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows: ##TABLE_START December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Health care cost trend rate assumed next year   7.50 %   7.00 %   7.50 % Ultimate trend rate   5.00 %   5.00 %   5.00 % Year that trend reached ultimate rate   2018    2014    2014    ##TABLE_END Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. To determine the health care cost trend rates we look at a combination of information including ongoing claims cost monitoring, annual statistical analyses of claims data, reconciliation of forecast claims against actual claims, review of trend assumptions of other plan sponsors and national health trends, and adjustments for plan design changes, workforce changes, and changes in plan participant behavior. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect: ##TABLE_START    Increase   Decrease  Effect on total of service and interest cost  $ 51   $ (44 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation   742    (654 )   ##TABLE_END Plan Assets Investment Strategy The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive, total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified. We update our long-term, strategic asset allocations every three-to-five years. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investment benchmarks for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions (such as private equity and real estate), and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced on a monthly basis.  The actual allocations for the pension assets at December 31 and target allocations by asset class, are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Percentage of Plan Assets   Target Allocations  Asset Class  2010   2009   2010   2009  Fixed income   49 %   50 %   45 %   45 % Global equity   33    34    28    28  Private equity   5    5    6    6  Real estate and real assets   5    4    10    10  Global strategies   4    4    5    5  Hedge funds   4    3    6    6  Total   100 %   100 %   100 %   100 %   ##TABLE_END Fixed income securities are invested broadly and primarily in long duration instruments. Global equity securities are invested broadly in U.S. and non-U.S. companies which are in various industries and countries and through a range of market capitalizations. Real estate and real assets include global private investments and publicly traded investments (such as REITs in the case of real estate). Real estate includes but is not limited to investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include but are not limited to investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber) and infrastructure. Private equity investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) and fund-of-funds that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies. Global strategies seek to capitalize on inefficiencies identified across different asset classes or markets, primarily using long-short positions in derivatives and physical securities. Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to event driven, relative value, long-short and market neutral. A well-diversified number of hedge funds are held. Investment managers are retained for explicit investment roles specified by contractual investment guidelines. Certain investment managers are authorized to invest in derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve the desired market exposure of a security or an index, transfer value-added performance between asset classes, achieve the desired currency exposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation. As a percentage of total plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were 9.8% and 6.0% for fixed income, including to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and negative 0.2% and 0.0% for global equity and currency overlay at December 31, 2010 and 2009. In November 2009, the Company elected to contribute $1,500 of our common stock to the pension fund. An independent fiduciary was retained to manage and liquidate the stock over time at its discretion. Plan assets included $1,498 and $1,581 of our common stock as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Risk Management In managing the plan assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability management and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach and are integral to the overall investment strategy. Further, asset classes are constructed to achieve diversification by investment strategy, by investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored regularly through the custodian. Credit parameters for counterparties have been established for managers permitted to trade over-the-counter derivatives.  Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs. ##TABLE_START    December 31, 2010   December 31, 2009     Total   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Total   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3  Fixed income securities:         Corporate  $ 13,038    $ 13,034   $ 4   $ 13,259    $ 13,254   $ 5  U.S. government and agencies   3,734     3,734     3,886     3,886   Mortgage backed and asset backed   880     847    33    916     893    23  Other   3,469   $ 19    3,450     2,628   $ 19    2,609   Derivatives:         Assets   18     18     33     33   Liabilities   (20 )    (20 )    (93 )    (93 )  Cash equivalents and other short-term investments   2,781    2,342    439     2,068    1,679    389   Currency overlay derivatives:         Assets   106     106     107     107   Liabilities   (121 )    (121 )    (94 )    (94 )  Equity securities:         U.S. common and preferred stock   4,925    4,925      4,691    4,691    Non-U.S. common and preferred stock   6,414    6,367    47     6,703    6,634    69   Boeing company stock   1,498    1,498      1,581    1,581    Common/collective/pooled funds   3,097    105    2,992     2,574    89    2,485   Derivatives:         Assets   21     21     9     9   Liabilities   (11 )    (11 )    (10 )    (10 )  Private equity   2,636    10     2,626    2,300    9     2,291  Real estate and real assets   2,488    665    5    1,818    1,784    442    5    1,337  Global strategies   2,015    443    1,503    69    1,676    484    1,192   Hedge funds   1,918            1,918    1,347        336    1,011  Total  $ 48,886   $ 16,374   $ 26,044   $ 6,468   $ 45,365   $ 15,628   $ 25,070   $ 4,667    Cash  $ 79      $ 125     Receivables   393       641     Payables   (106 )               (321 )             Total  $ 49,252      $ 45,810       ##TABLE_END Fixed income securities are primarily valued using a market approach with inputs that include broker quotes, benchmark yields, base spreads and reported trades. Cash equivalents and other short-term investments, which are used to pay benefits, are primarily held in registered money market funds which are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Other cash equivalent and short-term investments are valued daily by the fund using a market approach with inputs that include quoted market prices for similar instruments.  Common and preferred stock equity securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Common/collective/pooled funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their net asset values (NAVs) that are calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Active currency managers, through an overlay program, invest in a broad set of currency derivatives. Derivatives leveled in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued using an income approach with inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates. Exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Private equity LP valuations are reported by the fund manager and are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. Real estate and real asset fund values are primarily reported by the fund manager and are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. Publically traded REITs are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Global strategies are primarily limited liability company (LLC) or mutual fund structures. The LLCs are primarily valued using a market approach based on NAVs calculated by the fund and have monthly liquidity. Global strategies mutual funds are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Hedge funds consist of fund-of-fund LLC or commingled fund structures and direct hedge funds. The LLCs are primarily valued using a market approach based on NAVs calculated by the fund and are not publicly available. Liquidity for the LLCs is monthly and is subject to liquidity of the underlying hedge funds. The commingled fund NAV is calculated by the manager on a daily basis and has monthly liquidity. Direct hedge funds are primarily valued by each funds third party administrator based on valuation of the underlying securities and instruments and primarily applying a market or income valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument, equity, fixed income, currency or derivative, held; inputs for each of these investment types are discussed earlier. Direct hedge fund NAVs based on valuation of the underlying holdings are not publicly available and have monthly liquidity. Some of our assets, primarily our private equity, real estate and real assets, hedge funds and global strategies, do not have readily determinable market values given the specific investment structures involved and the nature of the underlying investments. For the December 31, 2010 and 2009 plan asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used where possible. For assets without readily determinable values, estimates were derived from investment manager discussions focusing on underlying fundamentals and significant events. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) we use net asset values, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events.  The following tables present a reconciliation of Level 3 assets held during the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Beginning for the year ended December 31, 2010, transfers into and out of Level 3 are treated as beginning of year values. ##TABLE_START    January 1, 2010 Balance   Net Realized and Unrealized Gains/(Losses)   Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements   Net Transfers Into/(Out of) Level 3   December 31, 2010 Balance  Fixed income securities:      Corporate  $ 5    $ (1 )   $ 4  Mortgage backed and asset backed   23   $ (1 )   15   $ (4 )   33  Private equity   2,291    379    (44 )    2,626  Real estate and real assets   1,337    157    324     1,818  Global strategies    (1 )  $ 70     69  Hedge funds   1,011    92   $ 815        1,918  Total  $ 4,667   $ 626   $ 1,179   $ (4 )  $ 6,468    ##TABLE_END For the year ended December 31, 2010, the change in unrealized gain/(loss) for Level 3 assets still held at December 31, 2010 were $1 for Mortgage backed and asset backed securities, $397 for Private equity, $136 for Real estate and real assets, $(1) for Global Strategies and $92 for Hedge funds. ##TABLE_START    January 1, 2009 Balance   Net Realized and Unrealized Gains/(Losses)   Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements   Net Transfers Into/(Out of) Level 3   December 31, 2009 Balance  Fixed income securities:      Corporate  $ 9    $ (4 )   $ 5  Mortgage backed and asset backed   49   $ 1    (32 )  $ 5    23  Private equity   2,020    142    129     2,291  Real estate and real assets   1,629    (505 )   213     1,337  Hedge funds   885    126            1,011  Total  $ 4,592   $ (236 )  $ 306   $ 5   $ 4,667    ##TABLE_END OPB Plan Assets The majority of OPB plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised of approximately 60% equities and 40% debt securities. The index fund is valued using a market approach based on the quoted market price of an identical instrument (Level 1). The expected rate of return on these assets does not have a material effect on the net periodic benefit cost. Cash Flows Contributions Required pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) as well as rules governing funding of our non-U.S. pension plans, are not expected to be material in 2011. In 2011 we expect to make discretionary contributions to our plans of approximately $500. We expect that if interest rates remain at their current levels, discount rates for ERISA determinations will likely decline in future years because of retrospective averaging, and as a result, contributions in future years are expected to increase. We expect to contribute approximately $15 to our OPB plans in 2011.  Estimated Future Benefit Payments The table below reflects the total pension benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants share of the cost, which is funded by participant contributions. OPB payments reflect our portion only. ##TABLE_START Year(s)  2011   2012   2013   2014   2015   20162020  Pensions  $ 2,731   $ 2,848   $ 2,992   $ 3,145   $ 3,279   $ 18,712  Other postretirement benefits:       Gross benefits paid   553    568    592    620    645    3,659  Medicare Part D subsidy   (31 )   (32 )   (33 )   (34 )   (35 )   (177 ) Net other postretirement benefits  $ 522   $ 536   $ 559   $ 586   $ 610   $ 3,482    ##TABLE_END Termination Provisions Certain of the pension plans provide that, in the event there is a change in control of the Company which is not approved by the Board of Directors and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required by ERISA, and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits in our group insurance benefit programs. We have an agreement with the U.S. government with respect to certain pension plans. Under the agreement, should we terminate any of the plans under conditions in which the plans assets exceed that plans obligations, the U.S. government will be entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plans assets based on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts. 401(k) Plans We provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expense for these defined contribution plans was $614, $591 and $571 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Note 15  Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements Share-Based Compensation Our 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended on April 27, 2009, permits awards of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, stock units, Performance Shares, performance units and other incentives to our employees, officers, consultants and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock available for issuance under the amended plan will not exceed 80,000,000 and no more than an aggregate of 16,000,000 shares are available for issuance as restricted stock awards. Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to meet any requirements to issue shares during 2011.  Share-based plans expense is primarily included in general and administrative expense since it is incentive compensation issued primarily to our executives. The share-based plans expense and related income tax benefit follow: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Stock options  $ 96   $ 111   $ 119  Restricted stock units and other awards   83    56    29  ShareValue Trust   36    71    61  Share-based plans expense  $ 215   $ 238   $ 209    Income tax benefit  $ 83   $ 89   $ 79    ##TABLE_END Stock Options On February 22, 2010, February 23, 2009 and February 25, 2008, we granted to our executives 5,932,806, 7,423,242 and 6,411,300 options, respectively. The options have been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. The stock options granted after 2005 vest over a period of three years, with 34% vesting after the first year, 33% vesting after the second year and the remaining 33% vesting after the third year. If an executive terminates employment for any reason, the non-vested portion of the stock option will not vest and all rights to the non-vested portion will terminate completely. Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2010 is as follows: ##TABLE_START    Shares   Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share   Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (years)   Aggregate Intrinsic Value  Number of shares under option:     Outstanding at beginning of year   26,336,436   $ 63.93    Granted   6,079,675    63.95    Exercised   (2,123,236 )   40.96    Forfeited   (1,159,701 )   55.84    Expired   (157,732 )   59.35          Outstanding at end of year   28,975,442    $65.96    6.9   $ 238  Exercisable at end of year   17,262,715   $ 72.28    5.7   $ 105    ##TABLE_END The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $59, $2 and $22 during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash received from options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $87, $10 and $44 with a related tax benefit of $20, $1 and $6, respectively, derived from the compensation deductions resulting from these option exercises. At December 31, 2010, there was $85 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the Stock Option plan which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years. The total fair value of stock options vested during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $103, $114 and $82, respectively.  The fair values of options were estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: ##TABLE_START Grant Year  Grant Date   Expected Life   Expected Volatility   Dividend Yield   Risk Free Interest Rate   Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share  2010   2/22/10    6 years    31.5 %   3.0 %   2.9 %  $ 15.70  2009   2/23/09    6 years    39.0 %   2.4 %   2.0 %   11.12  2008   2/25/08    6 years    28.8 %   1.7 %   3.2 %   23.47    ##TABLE_END The expected volatility of the stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock volatility and the volatility levels implied on the grant date by actively traded option contracts on our common stock. We determined the expected term of the stock option grants to be six years, calculated using the simplified method in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 110. We use the simplified method since we changed the vesting terms, tax treatment and the recipients of our stock options beginning in 2006 such that we believe our historical data no longer provides a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. Restricted Stock Units On February 22, 2010, we granted to our executives 1,459,256 restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of our long-term incentive program with a grant date fair value of $63.83 per share. On February 23, 2009, we granted to our executives 2,144,501 RSUs, with a fair value of $35.57 per share. The RSUs vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will immediately vest on a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year performance period. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate completely. In addition to RSUs awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant RSUs to certain executives and employees to encourage retention or to reward various achievements. These RSUs are labeled other restricted stock units in the table below. The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average stock price on the date of grant. Stock units settle in common stock on a one-for-one basis and are not contingent upon stock price. Stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2010 is as follows: ##TABLE_START    Incentive Program Restricted Stock Units   Other Restricted Stock Units  Number of units:   Outstanding at beginning of year   2,111,392    1,849,278  Granted   1,496,629    336,574  Dividends   80,631    45,753  Forfeited   (187,135 )   (36,773 ) Distributed   (75,717 )   (492,881 ) Outstanding at end of year   3,425,800    1,701,951  Unrecognized compensation cost at December 31, 2010  $ 78   $ 36  Weighted average remaining contractual life (years)   1.9    2.1    ##TABLE_END  ShareValue Trust The ShareValue Trust, established July 1, 1996, was a 14-year irrevocable trust that held shares of our common stock, received dividends, and distributed to employees the appreciation in value above a 3% per annum threshold rate of return at the end of each period. At June 30, 2010, the appreciation in stock price did not exceed the threshold, and no distribution was triggered for the final period of the trust. This was the final investment period of the trust, and no potential distributions remain. The trust was terminated effective July 1, 2010 with the 29,948,920 undistributed shares returned to the Company. Deferred tax assets of $229 related to the undistributed shares were written off at June 30, 2010, offset against previous excess tax benefits recorded in Additional paid-in capital. Other Compensation Arrangements Performance Awards Performance Awards are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a three-year period. Each unit has an initial value of $100 dollars per unit. The amount payable at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars per unit, depending on the Companys performance against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to pay these awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on the estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we granted Performance Awards to our executives with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals for each three-year period following the grant date. The minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out for the 2010 and 2009 Performance Awards is $250 and $290. There will be no payout of the 2008 Performance Awards. Deferred Compensation The Company has a deferred compensation plan which permits executives to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus, and certain other incentive awards. Prior to May 1, 2006, employees who participated in the deferred compensation plan could choose to defer in either an interest earning account or a Boeing stock unit account. Effective May 1, 2006, participants can diversify deferred compensation among 19 investment funds including the interest earning account and the Boeing stock unit account. Total expense/(income) related to deferred compensation was $112, $158 and ($223) in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Additionally, for employees who elected to defer their compensation in stock units prior to January 1, 2006, the Company matched 25% of the deferral with additional stock units. Effective January 1, 2006, all matching contributions are settled in stock upon retirement. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred compensation liability which is being marked to market was $1,149 and $1,143. Note 16  Shareholders Equity On October 29, 2007, the Board approved the repurchase of up to $7,000 of common stock (the Program). Unless terminated earlier by a Board resolution, the Program will expire when we have used all authorized funds for repurchase. At December 31, 2010, $3,610 in shares may still be purchased under the Program. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were 1,200,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. No preferred stock has been issued.  Changes in Share Balances The following table shows changes in each class of shares: ##TABLE_START    Common Stock   Treasury Stock   ShareValue Trust  Balance January 1, 2008   1,012,261,159    244,217,170    31,362,850  Issued    (629,111 )  Acquired    42,073,885    658,582  Payout           (3,560,663 ) Balance December 31, 2008   1,012,261,159    285,661,944    28,460,769  Issued    (30,428,387 )  Acquired       1,173,152    1,102,555  Balance December 31, 2009   1,012,261,159    256,406,709    29,563,324  Issued    (9,353,570 )   Acquired     385,596  ShareValue Trust termination       29,948,920    (29,948,920 ) Balance December 31, 2010   1,012,261,159    277,002,059     ##TABLE_END Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The components of Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009  Pension and postretirement adjustments  $ (14,079 )  $ (12,154 ) Unrealized gains on derivative instruments, net of reclassification adjustments   95    67  Unrealized losses on certain investments, net of reclassification adjustments   (6 )   (6 ) Foreign currency translation adjustments   232    216  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  $ (13,758 )  $ (11,877 )   ##TABLE_END Note 17  Derivative Financial Instruments Cash Flow Hedges Our cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, commodity swaps, and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage currency risk associated with certain transactions, specifically forecasted sales and purchases made in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency contracts hedge forecasted transactions principally occurring within five years in the future, with certain contracts hedging transactions up to 2021. We use commodity derivatives, such as swaps and fixed-price purchase commitments, to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. These include commitments to purchase electricity at fixed prices through 2016. Fair Value Hedges Interest rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt. The net change in fair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in Boeing Capital Corporation interest expense.  Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment We also hold certain derivative instruments, primarily foreign currency forward contracts, for risk management purposes but without electing any form of hedge accounting. Notional Amounts and Fair Values The notional amounts and fair values of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Notional amounts (1)   Other assets   Other accrued liabilities     2010   2009   2010   2009   2010   2009  Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:       Foreign exchange contracts  $ 2,001   $ 2,353   $ 266   $ 233   $ (15 )  $ (22 ) Interest rate contracts   875    1,475    24    32     (18 ) Commodity contracts   144    189      (113 )   (88 ) Derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment:       Foreign exchange contracts   646    693    8    32    (58 )   (99 ) Total derivatives   3,666    4,710    298    297    (186 )   (227 ) Netting arrangements           (71 )   (119 )   71    119  Net recorded balance    $ 227   $ 178   $ (115 )  $ (108 )   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Notional amounts represent the gross contract/notional amount of the derivatives outstanding. ##TABLE_END Gains/(losses) associated with our cash flow and undesignated hedging transactions and their effect on other comprehensive loss and Net earnings were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009  Effective portion recognized in other comprehensive loss, net of taxes:   Foreign exchange contracts  $ 67   $ 180  Commodity contracts   (30 )   (24 ) Undesignated derivatives recognized in Other income/(expense), net:   Foreign exchange contracts   (33 )   (9 )   ##TABLE_END For the year ended December 31, 2010, we reclassified a net gain of $14 (pre-tax) from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings. Based on our portfolio of cash flow hedges, we expect to reclassify gains of $22 (pre-tax) during the next 12 months. Ineffectiveness related to our hedges was insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. We have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. For foreign exchange contracts with original maturities of at least five years, our derivative counterparties could require settlement if we default on our five-year credit facility, expiring November 2012. For commodity contracts, our counterparties could require collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and commodity contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at December 31, 2010 was $78. At December 31, 2010, there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives.  Note 18  Significant Group Concentrations of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments involving potential credit risk are predominantly with commercial aircraft customers and the U.S. government. Of the $10,496 in gross accounts receivable and gross customer financing included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2010, $4,996 related to commercial aircraft customers ($570 of accounts receivable and $4,426 of customer financing) and $2,969 related to the U.S. government. Of the $5,033 in gross customer financing, $4,310 related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. AirTran Airways, American Airlines, Continental Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines were associated with 27%, 16%, 9% and 8%, respectively, of our financing portfolio. Financing for aircraft is collateralized by security in the related asset. As of December 31, 2010, there was $9,865 of financing commitments related to aircraft on order including options and proposed as part of sales campaigns described in Note 11, of which $8,490 related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work. Significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include AEWC, P-8I, KC-767 International Tanker and commercial and military satellites. The operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost and revenue estimates could also result in lower margins or a material charge for reach-forward losses in 2011. Commercial Airplane Development Programs Significant risks are inherent throughout the development of new commercial airplanes and new commercial airplane derivatives. Currently both the 787-8 and 747-8 freighter are in the demanding flight test and certification stages of program development. The 787-9 and 747-8 Intercontinental airplanes are also in development. These programs require substantial investments and research and development as well as investments in working capital and infrastructure. They also entail significant commitments to customers and suppliers and require substantial internal resources. Performance issues on these programs could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results and financial position in 2011. Other Risk As of December 31, 2010, approximately 36% of our total workforce was represented by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 1% of our total workforce was represented by agreements expiring during 2011.  Note 19  Fair Value Measurements The following tables present our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs. ##TABLE_START    December 31, 2010   December 31, 2009     Total   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Total   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3  Assets         Money market funds  $ 3,337   $ 3,337     $ 3,575   $ 3,575    Available-for-sale investments:         Debt  $ 5     $ 5    112    $ 107   $ 5  Equity   10    10      27    27    Derivatives   227       $ 227        178        178      Total assets  $ 3,579   $ 3,347   $ 227   $ 5   $ 3,892   $ 3,602   $ 285   $ 5    Liabilities         Derivatives  $ (115 )      $ (115 )      $ (108 )      $ (108 )     Total liabilities  $ (115 )   $ (115 )   $ (108 )   $ (108 )    ##TABLE_END Money market funds and equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Available-for-sale debt investments are primarily valued using a market approach based on benchmark yields, reported trades and broker/dealer quotes. Derivatives include foreign currency, commodity and interest rate contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve. Certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The table below presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended December 31, and the carrying value and asset classification of the related assets still held as of December 31: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009     Carrying Value   Total Losses   Carrying Value   Total Losses  Operating lease equipment  $ 247   $ (143 )  $ 199   $ (75 ) Property, plant and equipment    (4 )   13    (13 ) Receivables           1    (6)  Total  $ 247   $ (147 )  $ 213   $ (94 )   ##TABLE_END The operating lease equipment was valued using a market approach based on the fair value for the related aircraft. The property, plant and equipment was valued using an income approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying equipment.  Fair Value Disclosures The following table presents our financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values were as follows at December 31: ##TABLE_START    2010   2009     Carrying Amount   Fair Value   Carrying Amount   Fair Value  Assets     Accounts receivable, net  $ 5,422   $ 5,283   $ 5,785   $ 5,658  Notes receivable   480    501    1,045    1,072  Liabilities     Debt, excluding capital lease obligations   (12,234 )   (13,525 )   (12,848 )   (13,809 ) Accounts payable   (7,715 )   (7,704 )   (7,096 )   (7,063 ) Residual value, credit and other guarantees   (35 )   (15 )   (35 )   (20 ) Contingent repurchase commitments   (7 )   (84 )   (7 )   (63 )   ##TABLE_END The fair values of the Accounts receivable and Accounts payable are based on current market rates for loans of the same risk and maturities. The fair values of our variable rate notes receivable that reprice frequently approximate their carrying amounts. The fair values of fixed rate notes receivable are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt is based on current market yields for our debt traded in the secondary market. The fair values of the residual value guarantees and contingent repurchase commitments are determined using a Black Futures Options formula and include such assumptions as the expected value of the aircraft on the settlement date, volatility of aircraft prices, time until settlement and the risk free discount rate. The fair value of the credit guarantees is estimated based on the expected cash flows of those commitments, given the creditors probability of default, and discounted using the risk free rate. With regard to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of future financing commitments because the amount and timing of funding those commitments are uncertain. Note 20  Legal Proceedings Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts and other matters are pending against us. Potentially material contingencies are discussed below. We are subject to various U.S. government investigations, from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such government disputes and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, except as set forth below. Unless otherwise indicated below, a range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding set forth below cannot be estimated. A-12 Litigation In 1991, the Department of the Navy (the Navy) notified McDonnell Douglas Corporation (now merged into The Boeing Company) and General Dynamics Corporation (together, the Team) that it was terminating for default the Teams contract for development and initial production of the A-12 aircraft.  The Team had full responsibility for performance of the contract and both contractors are jointly and severally liable for any potential liabilities resulting from the termination. The Team filed a legal action to contest the Navys default termination, to assert its rights to convert the termination to one for the convenience of the government, and to obtain payment for work done and costs incurred on the A-12 contract but not paid to date. As of December 31, 2010, inventories included approximately $586 of recorded costs on the A-12 contract, against which we have established a loss provision of $350. The amount of the provision, which was established in 1990, was based on McDonnell Douglas Corporations belief, supported by an opinion of outside counsel, that the termination for default would be converted to a termination for convenience, and that the best estimate of possible loss on termination for convenience was $350. On August 31, 2001, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a decision after trial upholding the governments default termination of the A-12 contract. In 2003, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, finding that the trial court had applied the wrong legal standard, vacated the trial courts 2001 decision and ordered the case sent back to the trial court for further proceedings. On May 3, 2007, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a decision upholding the governments default termination of the A-12 contract. We filed a Notice of Appeal on May 4, 2007 with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On June 2, 2009, the Court of Appeals rendered an opinion affirming the trial courts 2007 decision sustaining the governments default termination. On August 14, 2009, we filed a Combined Petition for Panel Rehearing and for Rehearing En Banc in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On November 24, 2009, the Court denied our Combined Petition. On September 28, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court granted our request to review the decision of the Court of Appeals. Oral argument was held before the Supreme Court on January 18, 2011. We expect the U.S. Supreme Court to render a decision in the case in 2011. On December 29, 2009, the Navy sent letters to the Team requesting payment of $1,352 in unliquidated progress payments, plus applicable interest. On February 19, 2010, the Navy sent a letter confirming that it would not pursue payment from the Team pending the U.S. Supreme Courts review of this matter. We believe that the termination for default is contrary to law and fact and that the loss provision established by McDonnell Douglas Corporation in 1990, which was supported by an opinion from outside counsel, continues to provide adequately for the reasonably possible reduction in value of A-12 net contracts in process as of December 31, 2010. Final resolution of the A-12 litigation will depend on the outcome of further proceedings or possible negotiations with the U.S. government. If after reviewing the Court of Appeals decision, the U.S. Supreme Court determines, contrary to our belief, that a termination for default was appropriate, we could incur an additional loss of up to $275, consisting principally of $236 of remaining inventory costs. If the courts further hold that a money judgment should be entered against the Team, we could be required to pay the U.S. government up to one-half of the unliquidated progress payments of $1,350 plus statutory interest from February 1991 (currently totaling up to $1,530). In that event, our loss would total approximately $1,711 in pre-tax charges. Should, however, the March 31, 1998 judgment of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in favor of the Team be reinstated, we could be entitled to receive payment of approximately $1,163, including interest from June 26, 1991. Employment and Benefits Litigation We have been named as a defendant in two pending class action lawsuits filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, each related to the 2005 sale of our former Wichita facility to Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. (Spirit). The first action involves allegations that Spirits hiring decisions following the sale were tainted by age discrimination, violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), violated our collective bargaining agreements, and constituted retaliation. The case was brought in 2006 as a class action on behalf of individuals not hired by Spirit. During the second quarter of 2010, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Boeing and Spirit on all class action claims.  During the third quarter of 2010, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking reconsideration of the summary judgment decision. The second action, initiated in 2007, alleges collective bargaining agreement breaches and ERISA violations in connection with alleged failures to provide benefits to certain former employees of the Wichita facility. Discovery in the case is ongoing. Spirit has agreed to indemnify Boeing for any and all losses in the first action, with the exception of claims arising from employment actions prior to January 1, 2005. While Spirit has acknowledged a limited indemnification obligation in the second action, we believe that Spirit is obligated to indemnify Boeing for any and all losses in the second action. On October 13, 2006, we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. Plaintiffs, seeking to represent a class of similarly situated participants and beneficiaries in the Boeing Company Voluntary Investment Plan (the VIP), alleged that fees and expenses incurred by the VIP were and are unreasonable and excessive, not incurred solely for the benefit of the VIP and its participants, and were undisclosed to participants. The plaintiffs further alleged that defendants breached their fiduciary duties in violation of 502(a)(2) of ERISA, and sought injunctive and equitable relief pursuant to 502(a)(3) of ERISA. During the first quarter of 2010, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted a stay of trial proceedings in the district court pending resolution of an appeal made by Boeing in 2008 to the cases class certification order. On January 21, 2011, the Seventh Circuit reversed the district courts class certification order and decertified the class. The Seventh Circuit remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. BSSI/ICO Litigation On August 16, 2004, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. (BSSI) filed a complaint for declaratory relief against ICO Global Communications (Operations), Ltd. (ICO) in Los Angeles County Superior Court seeking a declaration that ICOs prior termination of two contracts for convenience extinguished all claims between the parties. On September 16, 2004, ICO filed a cross-complaint alleging breach of contract, economic duress, fraud, unfair competition, and other claims. ICO added The Boeing Company as a defendant in October 2005 to some of these claims and for interference with contract and misappropriation of trade secrets. On January 13, 2006, BSSI filed a cross-complaint against ICO, ICO Global Communications (Holdings) Limited (ICO Holdings), ICOs parent, and Eagle River Investments, LLC, parent of both ICO and ICO Holdings, alleging fraud and other claims. The trial commenced on June 19, 2008, with ICO seeking to recover approximately $2,000 in damages, including all monies paid to BSSI and Boeing Launch Services, plus punitive damages and other unspecified damages and relief. On October 21, 2008, the jury returned a verdict awarding ICO compensatory damages of $371 plus interest, based upon findings of contract breach, fraud and interference with contract. On October 31, 2008, the jury awarded ICO punitive damages of $236. On January 2, 2009, the court entered judgment for ICO in the amount of $631 which included $24 in prejudgment interest. On February 26, 2009 the trial court granted in part and denied in part post-trial motions we filed seeking to set aside the verdict. As a result, on March 3, 2009, the court entered an amended judgment for ICO in the amount of $604, which included $371 in compensatory damages, $207 in punitive damages and $26 in prejudgment interest. Post-judgment interest will accrue on the judgment at the rate of 10% per year (simple interest) from January 2, 2009. As of December 31, 2010, the amount of post-judgment interest totaled $121. We filed a notice of appeal and ICO filed a notice of cross-appeal in March 2009. As of November 1, 2010, the appeals were fully briefed. No date has been set by the court for argument. We believe that we have substantial arguments on appeal, which we intend to pursue vigorously.  BSSI/Telesat Canada On November 9, 2006, Telesat Canada (Telesat) and a group of its insurers served BSSI with an arbitration demand alleging breach of contract, gross negligence and willful misconduct in connection with the constructive total loss of Anik F1, a model 702 satellite manufactured by BSSI. Telesat and its insurers initially sought over $385 in damages and $10 in lost profits, but revised their demand to $263. BSSI has asserted a counterclaim against Telesat for $6 in unpaid performance incentive payments and also a $180 contingent counterclaim on the theory that any ultimate award to reimburse the insurers for their payments to Telesat could only result from Telesats breach of its contractual obligation to obtain a full waiver of subrogation rights barring recourse against BSSI. We believe that the claims asserted by Telesat and its insurers lack merit, but we have notified our insurance carriers of the demand. The arbitration was stayed pending an application by Telesat to the Ontario Superior Court on a preliminary issue. On July 16, 2010, the court denied Telesats request to exclude certain evidence, but granted its alternative request to remove the Chairperson from the arbitration panel. A new Chairperson was appointed on August 19, 2010, and the stay has been lifted. The arbitration hearing has been rescheduled for April 16, 2012. On April 26, 2007, a group of our insurers filed a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois asserting certain defenses to coverage and requesting a declaration of their obligation under our insurance and reinsurance policies relating to the Telesat Anik F1 arbitration. On June 12, 2008, the court granted the insurers motion for summary judgment, concluding that our insurance policy excluded the kinds of losses alleged by Telesat. On January 16, 2009, the court granted Boeings motion for reconsideration, ruling in favor of Boeing to require the insurers to provide insurance coverage to defend the claim. The case has been stayed pending completion of the underlying arbitration. Civil Securities Litigation On November 13, 2009, plaintiff shareholders filed a putative securities fraud class action against The Boeing Company and two of our senior executives in federal district court in Chicago. This lawsuit arises from our June 2009 announcement that the first flight of the 787 Dreamliner would be postponed due to a need to reinforce an area within the side-of-body section of the aircraft. Plaintiffs contend that we were aware before June 2009 that the first flight could not take place as scheduled due to issues with the side-of-body section of the aircraft, and that our determination not to announce this delay earlier resulted in an artificial inflation of our stock price for a multi-week period in May and June 2009. In March 2010, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cognizable claim, and, on May 26, 2010, the Court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint in its entirety. On June 22, 2010, the Court accepted the plaintiffs amended complaint, which we moved to dismiss. On August 10, 2010, the Court denied the motion and on August 30, 2010, we answered the amended complaint. On September 24, 2010, we moved to strike the portions of the amended complaint attributed to a confidential source and to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. On October 14, 2010, the Court denied our motions. On December 10, 2010, we moved for reconsideration of the Courts order denying our motion to dismiss. Discovery has commenced. In addition, plaintiff shareholders have filed three similar shareholder derivative lawsuits concerning the flight schedule for the 787 Dreamliner that closely track the allegations in the putative class action lawsuit. Two of the suits were filed in Illinois state court and have been consolidated. The remaining derivative suit was filed in federal district court in Chicago. No briefing or discovery has yet taken place in any of these lawsuits. We believe the allegations in all of these cases are without merit, and we intend to contest the cases vigorously.  Note 21  Segment Information We operate in five principal segments: Commercial Airplanes; Boeing Military Aircraft, Network  Space Systems, and Global Services  Support, collectively Boeing Defense, Space  Security; and Boeing Capital Corporation. All other activities fall within the Other segment or Unallocated items and eliminations. See page 55 for the Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Boeing Company Chicago, Illinois We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2. The financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 9, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. / S / D ELOITTE  T OUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois February 9, 2011  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Boeing Company Chicago, Illinois We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 of the Company and our report dated February 9, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule. / S / D ELOITTE  T OUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois February 9, 2011  ", "9A": " Item 9A.

Boeing Capital Corporation Segment BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Commercial Airplanes customers. In the space and defense markets, BCC primarily arranges and structures financing solutions for our BDS government customers. BCCs portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases, finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and investments. Financial and Other Business Information See page 54 for the Summary of Business Segment Data and Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information, including revenues and earnings from operations, for each of our business segments.  Intellectual Property We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. Non-U.S. Revenues See Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding non-U.S. revenues. Research and Development Research and development expenditures involve experimentation, design, development and related test activities for defense systems, new and derivative jet aircraft including both commercial and military, advanced space and other company-sponsored product development. These are expensed as incurred including amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on U.S. government contracts. Our total research and development expense amounted to $3.9 billion, $4.1 billion and $6.5 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Research and development expense in 2009 included $2.7 billion of production costs related to the first three flight test 787 aircraft that cannot be sold due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications that would be made to the aircraft. Research and development costs also include bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services, as well as costs incurred in excess of amounts estimated to be recoverable under cost-sharing research and development agreements. Bid and proposal costs were $332 million, $355 million and $343 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Research and development highlights for each of the major business segments are discussed in more detail in Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition on pages 23  38. Employees Total workforce level at December 31, 2011 was approximately 171,700.  As of December 31, 2011, our principal collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions: ##TABLE_START Union  Percent of our Employees Represented  Status of the Agreements with the Union The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM)  20%  We have two major agreements; one expiring in January of 2015 and one in September of 2016. The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA)  13%  We have two major agreements; one expiring in October of 2012 and one in December of 2013. The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW)  2%  We have two major agreements; one expiring in October of 2014 and one in February of 2015. ##TABLE_END Competition The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as Airbus, Embraer and Bombardier, and other entrants from Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with greater value products, services, and support. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity. BDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company and General Dynamics Corporation. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), the parent of Airbus, continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In addition, certain of our competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2012 with many international firms attempting to increase their U.S. presence. Regulatory Matters Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our international markets. Government Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default, based on our failure to meet specified performance measurements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and can require us  to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default. Commercial Aircraft. In the United States, our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Internationally, similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Joint Aviation Authorities. Environmental. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if more stringent clean-up standards are imposed, additional contamination is discovered and/or clean-up costs are higher than estimated. A Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site, the statutory framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. International. Our international sales are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, investment, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. International sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks. Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take one year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of companies. Suppliers We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could  adversely affect production schedules and program/contract profitability, thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. We are also dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices. Seasonality No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report.  Our Commercial Airplanes business depends heavily on commercial airlines, and is subject to unique risks. Market conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft. The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing (including the industrys ability to withstand the European sovereign debt crisis and other market developments), world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. Significant deterioration of the global economic environment or the financial health of the airline industry generally or of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period. We enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. In order to account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by an indexed price escalation formula. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us after our contract with the customer ends. In addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers. Our Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to develop new aircraft, achieve planned production rate increases across multiple programs and maintain a healthy production system. The design and production of airplanes is complex and requires exotic materials, highly skilled employees and extensive coordination and integration with suppliers. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy contractual performance requirements and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. In addition, we are continuing to increase production rates for the 737, 747, 777 and 787 programs. These risks are increased by our simultaneous development of derivative aircraft, such as the 787-9 and the 737 MAX, the completion of design changes identified during flight testing into already-manufactured 747 and 787 aircraft, and our recent incorporation of a second 787 final assembly line into our production system. If assembly line ramp-up efforts at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the rates necessary to achieve our planned rate increases, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and the financial performance of one or  more of our programs may suffer. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, the inability to efficiently and cost-effectively incorporate design changes into 787 and 747 production aircraft, and aircraft performance issues, could impact our ability to achieve our targeted production rates, and may result in aircraft delivery delays, higher production costs and/or lower program revenues. If we fail to deliver aircraft to our customers on time or meet contractual performance requirements, we could experience order cancellations or other significant financial exposures, or a reduction of the profitability of our Commercial Airplanes business. Our BDS business could be adversely affected by changing acquisition priorities of the U.S. government, particularly the Department of Defense, including an increased emphasis on affordability. The U.S. government participates in an increasingly wide variety of operations, including homeland defense, natural disasters, stabilization efforts, counterinsurgency and counterterrorism, that employ our products and services. The U.S. government, primarily operating through the U.S. DoD, continues to adjust its funding priorities in response to this changing threat environment. In addition, defense funding currently faces pressures due to the overall economic environment and competing budget priorities. Due to these pressures, the total U.S. DoD budget could decline. Any reduction in levels of U.S. DoD spending or cancellations or delays impacting existing contracts could have a significant impact on the operating results of our BDS business. We also expect that the U.S. DoD will continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. These initiatives will require us and our competitors to focus increasingly on long-term cost competitiveness and affordability when responding to proposals and/or pursuing development programs. If the priorities of the U.S. government change and/or we are unable to meet affordability targets, our BDS revenues and profitability could be negatively impacted. We depend heavily on U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks. In 2011, 38% of our revenues were derived from U.S. government contracts. In addition to normal business risks, our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique risks, some of which are beyond our control. The funding of U.S. government programs is subject to congressional appropriations . Many of the U.S. government programs in which we participate may last several years; however, initially these programs are normally funded yearly, with additional funds committed in later years as Congress makes additional appropriations. As a result, long-term government contracts and related orders are subject to modification, curtailment or termination, if appropriations for subsequent performance periods are not made, either due to changes in U.S. national security strategy and priorities or fiscal constraints. For example, the U.S. Army notified us of the termination for convenience of the BCTM System Development and Demonstration contract relating to Manned Ground Vehicles and associated systems and equipment. Similar further budgetary pressures could affect the funding for one or more of our existing programs. The termination or reduction of funding for U.S. government programs could result in a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and financial position. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate our contracts. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and at its convenience upon payment for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. In addition, if the U.S. government terminates a contract as a result of a default by us, we could be liable for additional costs, including reimbursement or damages. Modification, curtailment or termination of one or more of our major programs or contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Our contract costs are subject to audits by U.S. government agencies . U.S. government representatives may audit the costs we incur on our U.S. government contracts, including allocated indirect costs. Such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. We have recorded contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize upon final audit. However, we do not know the outcome of any future audits and adjustments and we may be required to reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. If any audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. Our business is subject to potential U.S. government inquiries and investigations. We are subject to certain U.S. government inquiries and investigations due to our participation in government contracts. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in fines, financial penalties, or suspension or debarment from future business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our sales to the U.S. government are also subject to specific procurement regulations and other requirements. U.S government procurement requirements are customary in U.S. government contracts, and generally result in increased performance and compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future, reducing our margins, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition. For example, in late 2011 the U.S. DoD published new regulations with stringent requirements and criteria to increase Government oversight of six key business systems of all prime contractors: accounting, earned value management, purchasing, material management and accounting, government property management and cost estimating. These new requirements and criteria may increase our compliance costs, and failure to comply with these regulations could result in the withholding of payments and harm our reputation and ability to secure future U.S. government contracts. Beginning in 2014, we also will be required to allocate higher pension costs to U.S. government contracts due to new requirements scheduled to be effective in 2012. These requirements could have a negative effect on our financial condition if we are unable to recoup these costs. We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns. Our BDS business generated approximately 60% of its 2011 revenues from fixed-price contracts. While firm fixed price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance. Fixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. If we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, our sales price could be reduced. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include AEWC, the USAF KC-46A Tanker, India P-8I and commercial and military satellites.  We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks. Our BDS business generated approximately 40% of its 2011 revenues from cost-type contracting arrangements. Some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Programs whose contracts are primarily cost-type include GMD, BCTM, P-8A Poseidon, Proprietary programs, JTRS, FAB-T and the EA-18G Growler Airborne Attack Electronic Aircraft. We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks. Contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit payments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite does not perform to specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance. The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees we ultimately expect to realize is recognized as revenue in the construction period. If the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criteria, customers will not be obligated to continue making in-orbit payments and/or we may be required to provide refunds to the customer and incur significant charges. Our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components. We rely on other companies including subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies, and production commodities and to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum, titanium or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the suppliers control or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs. We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results. Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. With respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling and other non-recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated  and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, escalation, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact these estimates. Any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under Managements Discussion and Analysis  Critical Accounting Policies  Contract Accounting/Program Accounting on pages 42  44 and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 55  56 of this Form 10-K. Competition within our markets may reduce our future contracts and sales. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasing competition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers and service providers in one or more of our market segments. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation and new priorities, including long-term cost competitiveness, of our U.S. DoD customer will intensify competition for many of our products and services. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not result in reduced revenues and market share. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries. In 2011, non-U.S. customers accounted for approximately 50% of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including: ##TABLE_START   changes in regulatory requirements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   domestic and international government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   fluctuations in international currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   volatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START   the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the U.S. Export-Import Bank; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   imposition of taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   economic and geopolitical developments and conditions. ##TABLE_END While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future. The outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could result in significant monetary payments and have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. We are involved in a number of litigation matters. These claims may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S government, the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our ownership of certain property. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could result in significant monetary payments (including possible environmental remediation costs) and have a material impact on our financial position and operating results. A significant portion of our and Boeing Capital Corporations customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers based in the United States, and in certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks. A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions, particularly in the United States. Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 aircraft. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position could be materially adversely affected. We may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. As of December 31, 2011, our airplane financing commitments totaled $15,866 million, as compared to $9,865 million as of December 31, 2010. If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the  global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance or outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures. As part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful. We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures. We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. While we maintain insurance for certain risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. government, insurance cannot be obtained to protect against all risks and liabilities. It is therefore possible that the amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft technologies, missile systems, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While many of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurance coverage we are able to maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims or liabilities. Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses. Our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. Any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of our data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse affect the reputation of Boeing and of our products and services.  Some of our and our suppliers workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages. Approximately 63,000 employees, which constitute 37% of our total workforce, are union represented as of December 31, 2011. We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BMA program production and we may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 12 U.S. labor organizations and 7 non-U.S. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions requirements without impacting our financial condition. The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations. Significant changes in discount rates, actual investment return on pension assets and other factors could reduce our earnings, equity, and increase pension contributions in future periods. The actuarial assumptions underlying the income or expense we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect assumptions relating to financial market and other economic conditions, such as the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and expected future medical inflation. Changes to these assumptions and differences between projected and actual performance can have a significant effect on our annual pension and other post retirement costs and/or result in a significant change to Shareholders equity. For U.S. government contracts, we must allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see Managements Discussion and AnalysisCritical Accounting PoliciesPostretirement Plans on pages 45  46 of this Form 10-K. Although GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or common stock we would contribute to our plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and discretionary contributions to improve the plans funded status. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or past manufacturing operations or the operations of companies we have acquired. In other cases, we may become subject to such costs due to an indemnification agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental liabilities. In addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation requirements could result in additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Unauthorized access to our or our customers information and systems could negatively impact our business. We face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems in order to address these threats. While these measures are  designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems, certain types of attacks could result in significant financial losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information technology systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we cannot prevent the unauthorized access, release and/or corruption of our customers confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or we could face financial losses.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in many countries and rely on an extensive network of international partners, key suppliers and subcontractors. Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses  Commercial Airplanes and Boeing Defense, Space  Security (BDS)  supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands and we price our products and services to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. Commercial Airplanes is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security and space to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets often offset. BCC delivers value by supporting our business units and managing overall financing exposure. Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Commercial Airplanes  $ 36,171   $ 31,834   $ 34,051  Boeing Defense, Space  Security   31,976    31,943    33,661  Boeing Capital Corporation   532    639    660  Other segment   138    138    165  Unallocated items and eliminations   (82 )   (248 )   (256 ) Total  $ 68,735   $ 64,306   $ 68,281   ##TABLE_END Revenues in 2011 increased by $4,429 million or 7% compared with 2010. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $4,337 million due to higher new airplane deliveries, including the impact of entry into service of the 787-8 and 747-8 Freighter, favorable new airplane delivery mix and higher commercial aviation services revenues. BDS revenues increased by $33 million primarily due to higher revenues in the Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA) and Global Services  Support (GSS) segments, partially offset by lower revenues in the Network  Space Systems (NSS) segment. Revenues in 2010 decreased by $3,975 million or 6% compared with 2009. Commercial Airplanes revenues decreased by $2,217 million due to lower 777 deliveries primarily resulting from a production rate change from 7 to 5 per month beginning in June 2010 and no deliveries on the 747 program due  to the transition from the 747-400 to the 747-8. These were partially offset by increases in commercial aviation services business. BDS revenues decreased by $1,718 million primarily due to lower revenues in the NSS segment. Earnings From Operations The following table summarizes our earnings/(loss) from operations: (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Commercial Airplanes  $ 3,495   $ 3,006   $ (583 ) Boeing Defense, Space  Security   3,158    2,875    3,298  Boeing Capital Corporation   125    152    126  Other segment   54    (327 )   (151 ) Unallocated items and eliminations   (988 )   (735 )   (594 ) Total  $ 5,844   $ 4,971   $ 2,096   ##TABLE_END Operating earnings in 2011 increased by $873 million compared with 2010. Commercial Airplanes earnings increased by $489 million, primarily due to higher revenues and a reduction in research and development costs, partially offset by increases in period costs associated with business growth. BDS earnings increased by $283 million compared with 2010 due to higher earnings in the BMA and GSS segments, partially offset by lower earnings in the NSS segment. Other segment earnings increased by $381 million primarily due to a $241 million reduction in the allowance for losses on receivables during 2011. Unallocated items and eliminations in 2011 reduced earnings by $253 million compared with 2010 primarily due to higher pension and postretirement costs. Operating earnings in 2010 increased by $2,875 million compared with 2009. Commercial Airplanes earnings increased by $3,589 million, primarily due to $2,693 million of costs related to the first three 787 flight test aircraft included in research and development expense in 2009 and the 2009 reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,352 million. BDS earnings decreased by $423 million compared with 2009 due to lower margins in the BMA segment and lower revenues in the NSS segment. Other segment earnings decreased by $176 million primarily due to $119 million in intercompany guarantees related to aircraft impairment charges and reduced aircraft collateral values. The most significant items included in Unallocated items and eliminations are shown in the following table: (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Share-based plans  $ (83 )  $ (136 )  $ (189 ) Deferred compensation   (61 )   (112 )   (158 ) Pension   (269 )   54    110  Postretirement   (248 )   (59 )   (93 ) Eliminations and other   (327 )   (482 )   (264 ) Total  $ (988 )  $ (735 )  $ (594 )  ##TABLE_END Share-based plans expense decreased by $53 million in both 2011 and 2010 primarily due to the expiration of the ShareValue trust at June 30, 2010. Deferred compensation expense decreased by $51 million and $46 million in 2011 and 2010. The year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price and broad stock market conditions.  Eliminations and other unallocated items expense decreased by $155 million in 2011 and increased by $218 million in 2010 primarily due to timing of intercompany expense allocations and elimination of profit on intercompany items. 2010 expense also includes a $55 million charitable contribution. Unallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for U.S. government contracting purposes. We recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of $3,127 million, $1,864 million and $1,816 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The increase in net periodic benefit costs related to pensions and other postretirement benefits is primarily due to higher amortization of actuarial losses and higher service costs driven by lower discount rates. Not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period. A portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense. The unallocated expense in 2011 includes $161 million of additional expense recorded during the third quarter due to an adjustment primarily related to prior years accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. See the discussion of the postretirement liabilities in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Earnings from operations included the following amounts allocated to business segments and Other unallocated items and eliminations. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Pension   Other Postretirement Benefits  Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009   2011   2010   2009  Allocated to business segments  $ (1,379 )  $ (1,155 )  $ (989 )  $ (444 )  $ (421 )  $ (522 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations   (269 )   54    110    (248 )   (59 )   (93 ) Total  $ (1,648 )  $ (1,101 )  $ (879 )  $ (692 )  $ (480 )  $ (615 )  ##TABLE_END Other Earnings Items (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Earnings from operations  $ 5,844   $ 4,971   $ 2,096  Other income/(expense), net   47    52    (26 ) Interest and debt expense   (498 )   (516 )   (339 ) Earnings before income taxes   5,393    4,507    1,731  Income tax expense   (1,382 )   (1,196 )   (396 ) Net earnings from continuing operations  $ 4,011   $ 3,311   $ 1,335   ##TABLE_END Other income decreased by $5 million in 2011 due to lower interest rates. The increase of $78 million in 2010 was driven by investment income on higher cash and investment balances. Interest and debt expense decreased by $18 million in 2011 due to the replacement of debt at lower interest rates. The increase of $177 million in 2010 was due to debt issued in 2009. Our effective income tax rate was 25.6%, 26.5% and 22.9% for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower in 2011 than in 2010 primarily due to an income tax charge of $150 million recorded during the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. During 2011, our effective tax rate was reduced by 7.4% due to a tax benefit of $397 million  recorded as a result of settling the 2004-2006 federal audit. We do not expect to settle any outstanding federal audits in 2012. Our effective tax rate was higher in 2010 than 2009, primarily because pre-tax book income in 2010 was higher than in 2009 and because of the income tax charge of $150 million recorded during the first quarter of 2010. This was partially offset by a tax benefit of $371 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of settling the 1998-2003 federal audit. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog Our backlog at December 31 was as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  2011   2010   2009  Contractual Backlog:    Commercial Airplanes  $ 293,303   $ 255,591   $ 250,476  Boeing Defense, Space  Security:    Boeing Military Aircraft   24,085    25,094    26,354  Network  Space Systems   9,056    9,586    7,746  Global Services  Support   13,213    13,684    11,924  Total Boeing Defense, Space  Security   46,354    48,364    46,024  Total contractual backlog  $ 339,657   $ 303,955   $ 296,500  Unobligated backlog  $ 15,775   $ 16,871   $ 19,058   ##TABLE_END Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog during 2011 and 2010 was due to commercial airplane orders in excess of deliveries and changes in projected revenue escalation for undelivered commercial airplanes. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The decrease in unobligated backlog during 2011 is due to decreases at BDS of $3,135 million compared with 2010 primarily due to funding of existing multi-year contracts and termination for convenience by the U.S. Army of the Brigade Combat Team Modernization (BCTM) program, partially offset by the U.S. Air Force (USAF) contract for the KC-46A Tanker and the Missile Defense Agency Development and Sustainment Contract. The decrease in unobligated backlog during 2010 is due to decreases at BDS of $1,993 million compared with 2009 primarily due to funding of existing multi-year contracts including the V-22, BCTM and Chinook programs, partially offset by multi-year procurement contract awards on the F/A-18 and International Space Station programs. Additional Considerations KC-46A Tanker On February 24, 2011, we were awarded a contract from the USAF to design, develop, manufacture and deliver 4 next generation aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Tanker will be a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. This contract is a fixed-price incentive firm contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs. Changes to our estimated cost to perform the work could result in a material charge. This contract contains production options. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. For segment reporting purposes, backlog, revenues and costs are recorded in the Commercial Airplanes and BMA segments.  Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment Political turmoil in the Middle East, the March 2011 natural disasters in Japan, the European sovereign debt crisis, deficit reduction challenges in the United States and high fuel prices continue to impact the global economy and airline traffic and costs. In the face of these challenges, passenger traffic has generally been more resilient than air cargo traffic. Air cargo traffic began contracting in May, and 2011 full year estimates indicate no growth over 2010. In contrast, 2011 passenger traffic year-over-year growth is expected to average around 6%, above the long-term average of 5%. However, there continues to be significant performance variation between regions and airline business models, with emerging markets and low cost carriers leading in the passenger markets. Despite relatively resilient passenger traffic, net profits for the global airline industry were impacted in 2011 by high oil prices, which were approximately 40% higher, on average, than 2010 prices. Net profits for the global airline industry are expected to be modest this year, totaling $7 billion in 2011, reduced from $16 billion in 2010. Airlines continue to focus on boosting revenue through alliances and partnerships and ancillary fees and services, while also cutting costs and renewing fleets to leverage more fuel efficient airplanes in a high-fuel-price environment. These airline strategies helped the airlines weather the global uncertainty in 2011. Current baseline forecasts for the economy and traffic suggest the outlook is for continued net profitability for the global airline industry in 2012, although expectations are that 2012 profits will be substantially lower than current estimates for 2011. Demand for commercial aircraft is also influenced by the availability of aircraft financing including export financing and other financing sources. Going into 2012 the European sovereign debt crisis remains a significant risk to the global economy and the airline industry. The long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast is for a long-term average growth rate of 5% - 6% per year for passenger and cargo traffic, based on a projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long-term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $4.0 trillion market for 33,500 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, and increased global environmental regulations. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia has enabled low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 15% of Commercial Airplanes contractual backlog, in dollar terms, is with U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. Airbus has  historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are likely to enter the 70 to 190 seat airplane market over the next few years. Many of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including launch aid, which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airplane development activities and enables airplanes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. Changes in value of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies impact competitors revenues and profits. Competitors routinely respond to a relatively weaker U.S. dollar by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer-term competitive posture. Airbus has announced such initiatives targeting overhead cost savings, a reduction in its development cycle and a significant increase in overall productivity through 2012. If the U.S. dollar strengthens, Airbus can use the improved efficiency to fund product development, gain market share through pricing and/or improve earnings. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Revenues  $ 36,171   $ 31,834   $ 34,051  % of Total company revenues   53 %   50 %   50 % Earnings/(loss) from operations  $ 3,495   $ 3,006   $ (583 ) Operating margins   9.7 %   9.4 %   -1.7 % Research and development  $ 2,715   $ 2,975   $ 5,383  Contractual backlog  $ 293,303   $ 255,591   $ 250,476  Unobligated backlog  $ 2,088   $ 49   $ 242   ##TABLE_END Revenues Year-over-year changes in Revenue are shown in the following table: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  2011 vs. 2010   2010 vs. 2009  New airplane sales  $ 3,766   $ (2,733 ) Commercial aviation services   594    569  Other   (23 )   (53 ) Total  $ 4,337   $ (2,217 )  ##TABLE_END  Revenues for 2011 increased by $4,337 million or 13.6% compared with 2010 due to higher new airplane deliveries, including the impact of entry into service of the 787-8 and 747-8 Freighter, favorable commercial airplane delivery model mix and higher commercial aviation services revenues. The increase in revenues from commercial aviation services was primarily due to increased sales of spares. Revenues for 2010 decreased by $2,217 million or 6.5% compared with 2009. The decrease in new airplane revenues primarily reflects lower 777 deliveries resulting from a production rate change from 7 to 5 per month beginning in June 2010 and no deliveries on the 747 program due to the transition from the 747-400 to the 747-8 derivative. The increase in revenues from commercial aviation services business was primarily due to increased sales of spares. Commercial airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    737   747   767   777   787   Total  2011       Cumulative Deliveries   3,878    1,427    1,014    983    3   Deliveries   372 (1)    9    20    73    3    477  2010       Cumulative Deliveries   3,506    1,418    994    910    Deliveries   376 (1)        12    74        462  2009       Cumulative Deliveries   3,130    1,418    982    836    Deliveries   372 (1)    8    13    88     481   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)   Includes intercompany deliveries of 7 737 airplanes in 2011, 5 737 airplanes in both 2010 and 2009. ##TABLE_END Earnings From Operations Earnings from operations for 2011 increased by $489 million compared with 2010. This increase reflects earnings of $376 million from higher revenues on new airplane deliveries, $180 million of higher earnings due to commercial aviation services volume and margins and $261 million of lower research and development expense, partially offset by increases of $328 million reflecting higher fleet support costs and other costs associated with business growth. Earnings from operations for 2010 increased by $3,589 million compared with 2009. The increase was primarily due to the 2009 reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of costs related to the first three 787 flight test airplanes, and the 2009 reach-forward losses on the 747 program. Costs of $2,693 million included in research and development expense in 2009 for the first three flight test 787 airplanes were a result of our determination that these airplanes could not be sold. The reach-forward loss on the 747 program of $1,352 million during 2009 was primarily due to increased production costs, reductions in projected delivery price increases associated with escalation and the difficult market conditions affecting the 747-8. The remaining net decrease in earnings for 2010 was primarily attributable to increased research and development expense of $285 million and lower new airplane deliveries. Backlog Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before Boeing and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their Board of Directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have  contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers. The increase in contractual backlog during 2011 and 2010 was due to orders in excess of deliveries and changes in projected revenue escalation, partially reduced by cancellations of orders. The increase in unobligated backlog in 2011 represents Commercial Airplanes share of the USAF contract for the KC-46A Tanker. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a programs life. Estimation of each programs accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. The table below provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet airplane deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. ##TABLE_START    Program     737   747   767   777   787  2011      Program accounting quantities   6,200    1,549    1,084    1,350    1,100  Undelivered units under firm orders   2,365    97    72    380    857  Cumulative firm orders   6,243    1,524    1,086    1,363    860  2010      Program accounting quantities   5,000    1,524    1,048    1,150    *  Undelivered units under firm orders   2,186    107    50    253    847  Cumulative firm orders   5,692    1,525    1,044    1,163    847  2009      Program accounting quantities   4,600    1,499    1,035    1,100    *  Undelivered units under firm orders   2,076    108    59    281    851  Cumulative firm orders   5,206    1,526    1,041    1,117    851   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START * The initial accounting quantity for the 787 program was established in the third quarter of 2011. ##TABLE_END 737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 1,200 units in 2011 due to the programs normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. During 2010, we announced plans to increase monthly production from 31.5 to 35 airplanes per month beginning in 2012 and a further increase to 38 airplanes per month beginning in 2013. On June 15, 2011, to address continued demand for delivery positions, we announced plans to increase production of the 737 to 42 airplanes per month beginning in 2014. On August 30, 2011, we announced the launch of the 737 MAX, the new engine variant of the 737. First delivery of the 737 MAX is expected in 2017.  747 Program The accounting quantity for the 747 program increased by 25 units in 2011. The 747-8 Freighter was certified during the third quarter and first delivery occurred in October 2011. First flight of the 747-8 Intercontinental passenger derivative occurred in March 2011 and type certification was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2011. During 2011, expected first delivery of the 747-8 Intercontinental was moved from the fourth quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2012 due to a delay in flight testing and the time required to incorporate all flight test driven engineering and design changes. We remain focused on incorporating these and other changes identified during flight testing into completed airplanes, achieving a planned production rate increase from 1.5 to 2 airplanes per month in mid-2012, reducing out-of-sequence work and improving supply chain efficiency. We are also continuing to monitor cargo market conditions. If risks associated with these areas cannot be mitigated, the program could be impacted by customer claims, lower orders, supplier assertions and/or the recognition of an additional reach-forward loss. We continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks. 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 36 units in 2011 due to the programs normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 200 units in 2011 due to the programs normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 777 programs first delivery at 7 airplanes per month from 5 per month occurred in June 2011. A further increase to 8.3 airplanes per month is planned for the first quarter of 2013. 787 Program We completed initial type certification flight testing activities and received design and production certifications for the 787-8 during the third quarter of 2011. We delivered the first 787-8 airplane in September 2011 and delivered two additional aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2011. We also completed the critical design review for the 787-9 derivative in 2011. In October 2011 we announced that the expected date of first delivery of the 787-9 had moved to early 2014 from late 2013. We continued to produce aircraft during flight testing and established a separate facility to incorporate engineering and other design changes identified during flight testing on already completed aircraft. We expect that aircraft completed in our Everett facility through mid-year 2012 will also require change incorporation. However, we expect that these later airplanes will require significantly less change incorporation than airplanes completed prior to 2012. We remain focused on achieving planned increases in 787 production rates while continuing to satisfy customer mission and performance requirements. We also continue to monitor and address challenges associated with aircraft assembly, including management of our extended global supply chain, incorporation of design changes into aircraft in various stages of assembly, completion and integration of traveled work as well as weight and systems integration. During 2011 we increased the production rate to 2.5 per month at our Everett final assembly line and started up the North Charleston final assembly line. We currently expect to increase the production rate of 787 aircraft to 10 aircraft per month in final assembly by the end of 2013 with first deliveries occurring at that rate in early 2014. Our efforts to achieve planned production rate targets include improving the production system, coordinating rate increases with suppliers, increasing production rates in both Everett and North Charleston, and establishing transitional surge capacity at Everett. In addition, we continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of prior schedule changes, including requests for contractual relief related to delivery delays and supplier assertions. During 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs associated with these airplanes were included in research and development expense. We believe that the other three 787 flight test aircraft are commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to those airplanes in program inventory at December 31, 2011. If we determine that one or more of the other aircraft cannot be sold, we may incur additional charges.  During the third quarter of 2011, we established an initial accounting quantity of 1,100 units, representing approximately 10 years of production at planned production rates. The cumulative impacts of production challenges, change incorporation, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts have created significant pressure on program profitability. As a result, we have recorded low margins on our 2011 deliveries. Future challenges, including not meeting one or more planned production rate increases going forward, or introducing the 787-9 derivative as scheduled, could result in additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions as well as result in further pressures on program profitability and/or a reach-forward loss. We continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks. Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. These costs are expected to continue to increase due to the 787 and 747-8 entry into service. Research and Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. Our Research and development expense decreased by $260 million in 2011. This was primarily due to certification of the 747-8 Freighter and 787-8. Our Research and development expense decreased by $2,408 million in 2010. This was primarily due to the reclassification to research and development expense of $2,693 million of production costs related to the three 787 flight test airplanes in 2009, partially offset by a $285 million increase of other research and development expense. Additional Considerations The 787 and 747-8 programs highlight the risks inherent in new airplane programs and new derivative airplanes, including, for example, development of the 787-9. In the third quarter of 2011 we launched a variant of the 737 that will feature new more fuel efficient engines  the 737 MAX. Costs related to development of new programs and derivative airplanes are expensed as incurred. Costs to produce new airplanes are included in inventory and accounted for using program accounting. Airplane programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated production costs exceed our estimated program revenues for the accounting quantity. Generally commercial airplanes are sold on a firm fixed-price basis with an indexed price escalation clause and are often sold several years before scheduled delivery. Each customer purchase agreement contains an escalation clause to account for the effects of economic fluctuations over the period of time from airplane sale to airplane delivery. A price escalation formula based on pre-defined factors is used to determine the final price of the airplane at the time of customer delivery. While firm fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. Many new airplanes and derivatives have highly  complex designs, utilize exotic materials and require extensive coordination and integration with supplier partners. As technical or quality issues arise, such as issues experienced on the 787 and 747-8 programs, we may experience schedule delays and higher costs to complete new programs and derivative airplanes. Additionally, price escalation factors may also impact margins by reducing the estimated price of airplanes delivered in the future. There are other factors that could also result in lower margins or a material charge if a program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses. These include: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for derivative airplanes and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Boeing Defense, Space  Security Business Environment and Trends U.S. Defense Environment Overview In August 2011, the Budget Control Act (the Act) reduced the DoD top line budget by approximately $490 billion over 10 years starting in fiscal year (FY) 2013. In addition, barring Congressional action, further budget cuts (or sequestration) as outlined in the Act will be implemented in FY13. Sequestration would lead to additional reductions of approximately $500 billion from the Pentagons top line budget over the next decade, resulting in aggregate reductions of about $1 trillion over 10 years. The U.S. DoD has taken the position that such reductions would generate significant operational risks and require the termination of certain procurement programs. Overseas Contingency Operations funding for Iraq and Afghanistan is also expected to decrease due to the reduction of U.S. forces in those countries. In January 2012, the DoD announced its Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG) partly in response to these budgetary challenges. In response to the proposed across the board budget cuts the DSG proposed that the DoD prioritize the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions, shrink ground forces, maintain nuclear deterrence, and reduce Cold War assets. The DSG also emphasizes the increasing importance of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Cyber; Space; Special Operations; and Unmanned Systems in implementing the DoDs strategic imperatives. Specific program allocations commensurate with this new guidance are expected to be announced in February 2012 as part of the Presidents FY13 budget request. While the DSGs proposals do incorporate some of the proposed funding reductions, they do not address the full impact that would be associated with sequestration pursuant to the Act. The budgetary pressures described above are expected to impact our other U.S. customers, including NASA, and the Intelligence community. To meet the needs of the DoD and other U.S. government customers in this challenging environment, BDS offers a balanced portfolio of platforms, services, and solutions that meet operational and fiscal requirements. However, these budgetary pressures are expected to place significant downward pressure on our revenues and margins in 2012. Target Market Environment Overview The DSG places strong emphasis on developing and acquiring specific capabilities for the U.S. Armed Forces. Capabilities expected to remain a focus of investment or increase per the DoD Strategic Guidance include: C4ISR; Cyber; Space; Special Operations; and Unmanned Systems. BDS has been anticipating this shift in DoD priorities and has aligned its strategy accordingly. As such, we have been making organic investments and pursuing targeted acquisitions to enhance our capabilities and better serve our customers and their emerging needs in these markets.  International Environment Overview The international market continues to be driven by rapidly evolving security challenges and the need for countries to modernize aging inventories. Western governments are pressured by new threats to security while at the same time dealing with constrained budgets. In Europe, the continuing financial crisis and the growing potential for a double dip recession are causing a contraction in the credit market and forcing governments to institute austerity measures that will negatively impact defense spending in the near term. The strongest opportunities for 2012 growth of the BDS portfolio will be in the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions where the relative financial strength of key countries coupled with a broad spectrum of evolving threats will result in procurement of defense and security systems. Similar to the domestic environment, BDS offers proven capability, predictable price, and near-term availability that are well suited to the enduring requirements in the international marketplace. BDS Realignment Effective January 1, 2011, 2010 and 2009, certain programs were realigned among BDS segments. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Revenues  $ 31,976   $ 31,943   $ 33,661  % of Total company revenues   47 %   50 %   49 % Earnings from operations  $ 3,158   $ 2,875   $ 3,298  Operating margins   9.9 %   9.0 %   9.8 % Research and development  $ 1,138   $ 1,136   $ 1,101  Contractual backlog  $ 46,354   $ 48,364   $ 46,024  Unobligated backlog  $ 13,687   $ 16,822   $ 18,815   ##TABLE_END Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues and earnings, may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Revenues BDS revenues increased by $33 million in 2011 compared with 2010, due to higher revenues in the BMA and the GSS segments, partially offset by lower revenues in the NSS segment. BDS revenues decreased by $1,718 million in 2010 compared with 2009, due to lower revenues in all three segments, with the largest decrease in the NSS segment. Operating Earnings BDS operating earnings in 2011 increased by $283 million compared with 2010 primarily due to higher earnings in the BMA and GSS segments, partially offset by lower earnings in the NSS segment. BDS operating earnings in 2010 decreased by $423 million compared with 2009 primarily due to lower margins in the BMA segment and lower revenues in the NSS segment.  Backlog Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. BDS total backlog decreased by 8% in 2011, from $65,186 million to $60,041 million, primarily due to funding of existing multi-year contracts and termination for convenience by the U.S. Army of the BCTM program, partially offset by new orders. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional Considerations Our business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished. Examples of these programs include Family of Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals, P-8A and Proprietary programs. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of our fixed-price development programs include Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEWC), India P-8I, USAF KC-46A Tanker and commercial and military satellites. Boeing Military Aircraft Operating Results (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Revenues  $ 14,947   $ 14,238   $ 14,304  % of Total company revenues   22 %   22 %   21 % Earnings from operations  $ 1,526   $ 1,250   $ 1,527  Operating margins   10.2 %   8.8 %   10.7 % Research and development  $ 541   $ 589   $ 582  Contractual backlog  $ 24,085   $ 25,094   $ 26,354  Unobligated backlog  $ 7,155   $ 8,297   $ 9,297   ##TABLE_END Revenues BMA revenues increased by 5% in 2011. The increase of $709 million in 2011 was primarily due to higher AEWC, C-17 and KC-767 International Tanker revenues. AEWC revenues increased by $780 million in 2011 due to delivery of the first two Peace Eye aircraft and higher Wedgetail milestone revenues. C-17 revenues increased by $273 million reflecting favorable mix, partially offset by fewer deliveries. International Tanker revenues increased by $235 million due to higher deliveries. In  addition, initial revenues on the USAF KC-46A Tanker were recognized in 2011. Lower volumes on the F-22, F/A-18 and Apache programs combined to reduce revenues by $613 million. Boeing production deliveries on the F-22 program ended in 2011. There were no new-build Apache deliveries in 2011, however, new-build deliveries are expected to resume in 2012. BMA revenues decreased by less than 1% in 2010 compared with 2009. Lower revenues in 2010 on the C-17, Apache and T-45 programs were nearly offset by higher Chinook, F/A-18 and AEWC revenues. Deliveries of new-build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  F/A-18 Models   49    50    49  F-15E Eagle   15    13    13  C-17 Globemaster   13    14    16  CH-47 Chinook   32    20    11  AEWC   3    4   KC-767 International Tanker   3    1    2  AH-64 Apache    13    23  T-45TS Goshawk           7  Total new-build production aircraft   115    115    121   ##TABLE_END Operating Earnings BMA operating earnings increased by $276 million in 2011 primarily due to $236 million of higher earnings on the AEWC program reflecting the initial Peace Eye deliveries and lower reach-forward loss provisions in 2011 on the AEWC Wedgetail and Peace Eagle contracts. Lower reach-forward losses of $49 million on KC-767 International Tanker program and lower research and development also contributed to the earnings improvements. BMA operating earnings decreased by $277 million in 2010 primarily due to lower deliveries of C-17 aircraft and less favorable pricing and mix on the C-17 program. Research and Development The BMA segment continues to focus research and development resources to leverage customer knowledge, technical expertise and system integration of manned and unmanned systems that provide innovative solutions to meet the warfighters enduring needs. Research and development expense decreased in 2011 primarily due to lower International Tanker development costs. Research and development activities utilize our capabilities in architectures, system-of-systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to better prepare us to meet customers needs in U.S. and international growth areas such as: military-commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, global strike, missiles and unmanned airborne systems, and surveillance and engagement systems. The products of our research and development support both new manned and unmanned systems as well as enhanced versions of existing fielded products. Investments support vertical integration of our product line in areas such as autonomous operation of unmanned systems, advanced sensors and electronic warfare. These efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness, interoperability, reliability and reducing the cost of ownership. Backlog BMA total backlog in 2011 decreased by 6% from 2010, primarily due to current year deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years partially offset by BMAs share of the USAF  contract awards for the KC-46A and low-rate initial production of the P-8A. Total backlog in 2010 decreased 6% from 2009, primarily due to deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years partially offset by a multi-year contract award on the F/A-18 program. Additional Considerations AEWC The AEWC development program, also known as Wedgetail in Australia, Peace Eagle in Turkey and Peace Eye in the Republic of Korea, consists of 737-700 aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems, some of which have never been installed on an airplane before. A total of five Wedgetail aircraft have been delivered to Australia with initial customer acceptance. Four were delivered in 2010 and one in September 2011. The final Wedgetail aircraft is scheduled for delivery with initial customer acceptance in the first quarter of 2012. Final customer acceptance for all six Wedgetail aircraft is also scheduled to be completed during the first half of 2012. In January 2011, the Peace Eagle program began the formal test phase which is scheduled to conclude in the second half of 2012. The first Peace Eye aircraft was delivered to the Republic of Korea in September 2011 and the second in December 2011. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded charges increasing the reach-forward losses on the AEWC programs in Australia and Turkey by $60 million, $174 million and $133 million, respectively. These are advanced and complex fixed-price development programs involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability. We believe that the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate; however, the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be delayed, either of which could result in lower margins or additional material charges. C-17 See the discussion of the C-17 program in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Network  Space Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Revenues  $ 8,673   $ 9,455   $ 10,877  % of Total company revenues   13 %   15 %   16 % Earnings from operations  $ 690   $ 711   $ 839  Operating margins   8.0 %   7.5 %   7.7 % Research and development  $ 476   $ 417   $ 397  Contractual backlog  $ 9,056   $ 9,586   $ 7,746  Unobligated backlog  $ 6,424   $ 8,435   $ 9,187   ##TABLE_END Revenues NSS revenues decreased 8% in 2011 and 13% in 2010. The decrease of $782 million in 2011 is primarily due to $577 million of lower revenues on the BCTM program which was terminated for convenience during 2011. Lower revenues on the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), SBInet and Joint Tactical Radio System programs reduced revenues by $150 million, $146 million and $93 million respectively, partially offset by $150 million of higher sales of Delta inventory to United Launch Alliance (ULA) and $250 million of higher commercial and civil satellite revenues. The decrease of $1,422 million in 2010 is primarily due to lower volume on the BCTM and GMD programs.  Delta launch and new-build satellite deliveries were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Delta II    1    1  Delta IV    1    1  Commercial and civil satellites   1    3    3  Military satellites   3    1    3   ##TABLE_END Operating Earnings NSS earnings decreased by $21 million in 2011 and $128 million in 2010 primarily due to lower revenues and higher research and development costs. NSS operating earnings include equity earnings of $194 million, $189 million and $164 million from the United Space Alliance joint venture and the ULA joint venture in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Research and Development The NSS research and development funding remains focused on the development of C4ISR that support a network-enabled architecture approach for our customers. Research and development expense increased in 2011 primarily due to higher expense associated with C4ISR prototypes. We are investing in capabilities to enhance connectivity between existing and new air/ground and maritime platforms, to increase communications availability, utility and bandwidth through more robust space systems, and to leverage innovative networking and ISR concepts. Investments were also made to develop concepts and capabilities related to cyber and security products, as well as the development of next-generation space and intelligence systems. Along with increased funding to support these network-enabled capabilities, we also maintained our investment levels in missile defense, directed energy and advanced exploration systems. Backlog NSS total backlog decreased 14% in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to termination for convenience by the U.S. Army of the BCTM program and revenues recognized on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by the contract award for the Missile Defense Agency Development and Sustainment Contract. Total backlog increased 6% in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to two commercial satellite contract awards, a multi-year contract award on the International Space Station program and GMD contract awards, partially offset by revenues recognized on the BCTM program. Additional Considerations Sea Launch See the discussion of the Sea Launch receivables in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Satellites See the discussions of Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The 2011 increase is primarily due to higher revenues on several Integrated Logistics (IL) programs and a Defense  Government services contract, partially offset by lower revenues from Maintenance, Modifications and Upgrades (MMU) due to the conclusion in 2010 of our KC-10 support program. The 2010 decrease is primarily due to lower revenues on several MMU programs partially offset by higher revenues on several IL programs. Operating Earnings GSS operating earnings increased by 3% in 2011 primarily due to higher earnings on several IL programs, partially offset by lower earnings on MMU programs. Operating earnings decreased 2% in 2010 primarily due to lower revenues. Research and Development GSS focused on its investment strategies in the following core businesses: IL, MMU, Training Systems  Services (TSS), and Defense  Government Services. Our investments also fund investigation into synergies between existing markets through our Advanced Services organization. This research continues the development and implementation of innovative tools, processes and systems which will deliver affordable readiness solutions to our customers. Backlog GSS total backlog decreased by 3% in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to revenues recognized on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years on several IL programs, partially offset by a TSS contract award on the P-8A program. Total backlog increased by 12% in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to the award of the UK LogNEC contract. Backlog also increased due to increases in several IL and MMU programs, partially offset by decreases in several TSS programs. Boeing Capital Corporation Business Environment and Trends BCCs customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2011 totaled $4,327 million. A substantial portion of BCCs portfolio is concentrated among certain U.S. commercial airline customers. BCCs portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types most notably out-of-production Boeing aircraft such as 717 aircraft.  BCC provided customer financing of $239 million and $72 million during 2011 and 2010. The European sovereign debt crisis poses a financing risk to airlines and may reduce overall levels of commercial aircraft financing. However, we expect the reduction in funding from European commercial banks to be largely offset by increased financing availability from other sources, such as capital markets, lessors, and banks from other regions of the world. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,000 western-built commercial jet aircraft (9.4% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2011, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 30% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2010 and 2009, 10.5% and 11.6% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. Summary Financial Information (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Revenues  $ 532   $ 639   $ 660  Earnings from operations  $ 125   $ 152   $ 126  Operating margins   23 %   24 %   19 %  ##TABLE_END Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease and interest from financing receivables and notes. BCCs revenues decreased $107 million in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to lower operating lease income from a smaller portfolio of equipment under operating leases as a result of aircraft returns and lower lease rates on re-leased aircraft and lower interest income on notes receivable resulting from a lower weighted average notes receivable balance and a decrease in the weighted average annual effective interest rate during 2011. The decrease in revenues in 2010 compared with 2009 of $21 million was primarily due to lower operating lease income from a smaller portfolio of equipment under operating leases as a result of aircraft returns and lower lease rates on re-leased aircraft. Earnings From Operations BCCs operating earnings are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Operating earnings decreased by $27 million in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to lower revenues and higher asset impairment expense partially offset by lower interest expense, lower depreciation expense and a reduction in the allowance for losses. The increase in operating earnings in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to lower asset impairment expense and a reduction in the allowance for losses. Financial Position The following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  2011   2010  BCC customer financing and investment portfolio  $ 4,327   $ 4,694  Valuation allowance as a % of total receivables   2.2 %   3.8 % Debt  $ 3,400   $ 3,446  Debt-to-equity ratio   6.2-to-1    5.0-to-1   ##TABLE_END  BCCs customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2011 decreased from December 31, 2010 due to normal portfolio run-off and asset sales, partially offset by the origination of notes receivable and purchase of equipment under operating lease. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, BCC had $521 million and $583 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease, of which $476 million and $28 million had either executed term sheets with deposits or firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $111 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2012. These aircraft are being remarketed or the leases are being extended and approximately $13 million of such aircraft had either executed term sheets with deposits or firm contracts as of December 31, 2011. BCC enters into certain transactions with the Other segment in the form of guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment. Bankruptcies On November 29, 2011, American Airlines, Inc. (American Airlines) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. American Airlines retains certain rights by operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, including the right to reject executory contracts, such as aircraft leases. At December 31, 2011 American Airlines accounted for $653 million of our customer financing portfolio, including $362 million recorded by BCC. American Airlines has not rejected any of the leases related to our aircraft. We believe that our customer financing receivables from American Airlines are sufficiently collateralized such that we do not expect to incur losses related to those receivables as a result of the bankruptcy. We continue to monitor the American Airlines bankruptcy for potential impacts on our business. Restructurings and Restructuring Requests From time to time, certain customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with BCC. As of December 31, 2011, BCC has not reached agreement on any restructuring requests that would have a material effect on our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. On May 2, 2011, Southwest Airlines Co. (Southwest) completed its acquisition of AirTran Holdings, Inc. AirTran Holdings successor entity (AirTran) and its subsidiaries represent approximately 26% of our gross customer financing portfolio carrying value, consisting principally of 717 aircraft. AirTran is the largest customer in terms of BCCs segment revenue and customer financing portfolio carrying value. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we revised the contractual terms of our leases with AirTran in conjunction with receiving a full guarantee from Southwest of those lease payment obligations. Revenue and earnings are expected to be approximately $30 million lower in 2012 due to these lease revisions. Other Segment (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Revenues  $ 138   $ 138   $ 165  Earnings/(loss) from operations   54    (327 )   (152 )  ##TABLE_END Other segment operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $381 million compared with 2010 primarily due to a $241 million reduction in the allowance for losses on AirTran receivables and $124 million of lower impairment charges related to our customer financing portfolio in 2011.  Other segment operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $175 million primarily due to $144 million of charges related to our customer financing portfolio and higher environmental remediation expenses of $36 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Summary (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Net earnings  $ 4,018   $ 3,307   $ 1,312  Non-cash items   2,140    2,679    2,381  Changes in working capital   (2,135 )   (3,034 )   1,910  Net cash provided by operating activities   4,023    2,952    5,603  Net cash provided/(used) by investing activities   2,369    (4,831 )   (3,794 ) Net cash (used)/provided by financing activities   (1,700 )   (1,962 )   4,094  Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents   (2 )   (15 )   44  Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents   4,690    (3,856 )   5,947  Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year   5,359    9,215    3,268  Cash and cash equivalents at end of year  $ 10,049   $ 5,359   $ 9,215   ##TABLE_END Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $1,071 million to $4,023 million during 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to higher earnings and lower working capital growth as the continued growth in inventory was partially offset by increases in advances from customers and accounts payable. Our investment in gross inventories increased to $56,499 million at December 31, 2011, up from $46,738 million at December 31, 2010 while advances and progress billings increased to $39,755 million at December 31, 2011 compared with $34,744 million at December 31, 2010. The increase in inventory was driven by higher investments in commercial airplane program inventory, specifically 787 inventory, while higher advances and progress payments reflect increased production rates and commercial airplane orders. We expect inventory to grow at a lower rate in 2012 as additional deliveries offset the ramp up of commercial airplane production and as design changes are incorporated into completed 747 and 787 airplanes. Cash contributions to our pension plans totaled $531 million and $35 million in 2011 and 2010. Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities totaled $2,369 million during 2011 compared with $4,831 million used during 2010, primarily due to lower investments in time deposits during 2011. In 2011, capital expenditures totaled $1,713 million up from $1,125 million in 2010. Capital spending in 2011 is higher than 2010 due to the construction of a 787 final assembly factory and related site buildings in North Charleston, South Carolina, higher spending to support commercial airplane production rate increases and capital improvements. We expect capital expenditures to be higher in 2012 due to continued investment to ramp up commercial production rates. Expenditures on acquisitions totaled $42 million, down from $932 million in 2010 which included the acquisition of Argon ST, Inc. for $782 million. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities totaled $1,700 million during 2011 compared with $1,962 million used during 2010 as proceeds from new borrowings of $799 million in 2011 more than offset $314 million of higher repayments of distribution rights financing and $241 million of higher debt repayments. In 2011, net proceeds from BCC borrowings amounted to $745 million and we repaid $930 million of debt, including repayments of $798 million of debt held at BCC. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the  recorded balance of debt was $12,371 million and $12,421 million, of which $2,353 million and $948 million were classified as short-term. This includes $3,400 million and $3,446 million of debt recorded at BCC, of which $879 million and $801 million were classified as short-term. In 2011 and 2010, we had 350,778 and 494,939 shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholding and did not repurchase any shares through our open market share repurchase program. During 2009, cash used in our open market share repurchase program totaled $50 million. Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We and BCC have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2011 and at December 31, 2011, neither we nor BCC had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $4,600 million ($1,500 million exclusively available for BCC) of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support possible commercial paper borrowings. Financing commitments totaled $15,866 million and $9,865 million as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, our pension plans were $16,600 million and $9,854 million underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an ERISA basis our plans were approximately 99% funded at December 31, 2011 with minimal required contributions in 2012. We expect to make discretionary contributions to our plans of approximately $1,500 million in 2012. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.  Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2011, and the estimated timing thereof. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Total   Less than 1 year   1-3 years   3-5 years   After 5 years  Long-term debt (including current portion)  $ 12,158   $ 2,257   $ 2,563   $ 1,864   $ 5,474  Interest on debt (1)   6,433    584    893    737    4,219  Pension and other postretirement cash requirements   27,778    612    4,503    8,827    13,836  Capital lease obligations   235    99    118    17    1  Operating lease obligations   1,311    202    333    180    596  Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position   106,235    36,589    37,591    21,749    10,306  Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position   14,153    13,432    699    4    18  Total contractual obligations  $ 168,303   $ 53,775   $ 46,700   $ 33,378   $ 34,450   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2011. Variable rate debt was approximately 1% of our total debt at December 31, 2011. ##TABLE_END Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Approximately 6% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts. Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.  Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation. Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2011, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2011, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $11.1 billion that extend through 2024. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Income Tax Obligations As of December 31, 2011, our net asset for income taxes receivable, including uncertain tax positions, was $179 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. Our income tax matters are excluded from the table above. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2011. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Total Amounts Committed/Maximum Amount of Loss   Less than 1 year   1-3 years   4-5 years   After 5 years  Standby letters of credit and surety bonds  $ 6,199   $ 4,693   $ 1,064   $ 304   $ 138  Commercial aircraft financing commitments   15,866    1,562    3,424    6,114    4,766  Total commercial commitments  $ 22,065   $ 6,255   $ 4,488   $ 6,418   $ 4,904   ##TABLE_END Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contingent Obligations We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our contesting the default termination of the A-12 aircraft, certain employment, labor and benefits litigation, litigation/arbitration involving Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. programs and civil securities litigation relating to disclosures concerning the 787 program.  Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $758 million at December 31, 2011. For additional information, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We have recorded a liability of $939 million at December 31, 2011 for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of these contingencies, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting We use contract accounting to determine revenue, cost of sales, and profit for almost all of our BDS business. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government. Generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contracts inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately as a charge to earnings. For the years ending December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all BDS contracts increased operating earnings by $229 million, $125 million and $29 million respectively. Significant adjustments recorded during the three years ended December 31, 2011 relate to reach-forward losses on the AEWC and the KC-767 International Tanker programs. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS for all of 2011 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $320 million. In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings.  Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates, consistent with typical sales contract terms. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower margins than established programs. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or other circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs, excluding the 747 and 787 programs, for all of 2011 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $276 million. The 747 program is in a reach-forward loss position having recorded a total of $2,037 million of reach-forward losses in 2009 and 2008. Absent changes in the estimated revenues or costs, subsequent deliveries are recorded at zero margin. Reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately. Any such increases could result in additional charges. The 787 program has a low single digit profit margin. The cumulative impacts of the production challenges, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts continue to place significant pressure  on revenues, costs and the profitability of the 787 program. The scale and duration of the 787 program is such that relatively minor changes in assumptions or variables could have a material effect on our reported results in any period if the program is determined to have a reach-forward loss. Aircraft Valuation Allowance for Losses on Customer Financing Receivables The allowance for losses on customer financing receivables (valuation provision) is used to provide for potential impairment of customer financing receivables in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the customer financing receivables portfolio. The estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including historical loss experience, collateral values, and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings, collateral values and default rates. If each customers credit rating were upgraded or downgraded by one major rating category at December 31, 2011, the allowance would have decreased by $41 million or increased by $107 million. If the collateral values were 20% higher or lower at December 31, 2011, the allowance would have decreased by $24 million or increased by $21 million. If the cumulative default rates used for each rating category increased or decreased 1%, the allowance would have increased or decreased by $7 million. Impairment Review for Assets Under Operating Leases and Held for Re-Lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than its carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Had future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been 10% lower, we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Residual Values Equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease. Estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease. If the estimated residual values declined 20% at December 31, 2011, we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, and a future cumulative pre-tax earnings reduction of approximately $106 million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods, of which approximately $11 million would be recognized in 2012. Our investment in sales-type/finance leases includes future minimum lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of leased assets less unearned income. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other than temporary are recognized in the period in which the decline occurs. If the estimated residual values declined 20% at December 31, 2011, we estimate that we would have reduced pre-tax income by $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.  Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. April 1 is our annual testing date. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any. We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2011 and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. A 10% decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our operations would have no impact on the carrying value of goodwill. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had $497 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and tradenames. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would reduce the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets by less than $1 million. Postretirement Plans The majority of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans. All nonunion and some union employees hired after December 31, 2008 are not covered by defined benefit plans. We also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend rate (rate of growth for medical costs). Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligations and Shareholders equity.  The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2011. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Change in discount rate Increase 25 bps   Change in discount rate Decrease 25 bps  Pension plans   Projected benefit obligation  $ (2,108 )  $ 2,684  Net periodic pension cost   (220 )   280  Other postretirement benefit plans   Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation   (173 )   203  Net periodic postretirement benefit cost   (13 )   15   ##TABLE_END Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2011 net periodic pension expense by $124 million. We expect 2012 net periodic pension cost to increase by approximately $700 million and the portion recognized in earnings for 2012 to increase by approximately $1.0 billion primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate from 5.3% at December 31, 2010 to 4.4% at December 31, 2011 and amortization of actuarial losses. Absent increases in interest rates, higher asset values and/or higher contributions, net periodic pension cost will increase further in future years. The assumed medical trend rates have a significant effect on the following years expense, recorded liabilities and Shareholders equity. The following table shows the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 100 basis point change as of December 31, 2011. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Change in medical trend rate Increase 100 bps   Change in medical trend rate Decrease 100 bps  Other postretirement benefit plans   Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation  $ 642   $ (572 ) Net periodic postretirement benefit cost   127    (111 )  ##TABLE_END  ", "7A": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Exposure to this risk is managed by generally matching the profile of BCCs liabilities with that of BCCs assets in relation to amount and terms such as expected maturities and fixed versus floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2011, the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained rise or fall in interest rates would be a $10 million increase or a $1 million decrease to BCCs pre-tax earnings. For purposes of the foregoing sensitivity analysis, we assume that the level of our floating rate assets and debt (including the impact of derivatives) remain unchanged from year-end 2011 and that they are all subject to immediate re-pricing. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our investments or customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. Based on the portfolio of other Boeing fixed-rate debt, the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2011, a 10% increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized gains by $220 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our unrealized gains by $248 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.  ", "8": " Item 8.

The Boeing Company and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as Boeing, the Company, we, us, or our). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Use of Estimates Management makes assumptions and estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Those assumptions and estimates directly affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant estimates for which changes in the near term are considered reasonably possible and that may have a material impact on the financial statements are disclosed in these notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Cycle For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year and could exceed three years. Revenue and Related Cost Recognition Contract Accounting Contract accounting is used for development and production activities predominantly by Boeing Defense, Space  Security (BDS). The majority of business conducted by BDS is performed under contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that extend over several years. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract resulting in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect to operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contracts percent complete. In 2011, 2010 and 2009 net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments increased operating earnings by $229, $125 and $29 respectively and EPS by $0.23, $0.12 and $0.03 respectively. Significant adjustments recorded during the three years ended December 31, 2011 relate to reach-forward losses on the AEWC and the KC-767 International Tanker programs. We combine contracts for accounting purposes when they are negotiated as a package with an overall profit margin objective. These essentially represent an agreement to do a single project for a single customer, involve interrelated construction activities with substantial common costs, and are performed concurrently or sequentially. When a group of contracts is combined, revenue and profit are earned uniformly over the performance of the combined contracts. Similarly, we may segment a single contract or group of contracts when a clear economic decision has been made during contract negotiations that would produce different rates of profitability for each element or phase of the contract.  Sales related to fixed-price contracts are recognized as deliveries are made, except for certain fixed-price contracts that require substantial performance over an extended period before deliveries begin, for which sales are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones. Sales related to contracts in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if specified targets are achieved. Incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated and are probable are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded. Program Accounting Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales related to its programs. Program accounting is applicable to products manufactured for delivery under production-type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contracts and years. Under program accounting, inventoriable production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced, and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. We recognize sales for commercial airplane deliveries as each unit is completed and accepted by the customer. Sales recognized represent the price negotiated with the customer, adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. The amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effects on program margins are recognized prospectively except in cases where the program is determined to have a reach-forward loss in which case the loss is recognized in the current period. Concession Sharing Arrangements We account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their purchase of products and services as a reduction to revenue when the related products and services are delivered. The sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendors products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products. Spare Parts Revenue We recognize sales of spare parts upon delivery and the amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost. Service Revenue Service revenue is recognized when the service is performed with the exception of U.S. government service agreements, which are accounted for using contract accounting. Service activities primarily include: support agreements associated with military aircraft and helicopter contracts, ongoing maintenance of International Space Station and Space Shuttle, commercial Delta launches and technical and flight operation services for commercial aircraft. Service revenue and associated cost of sales from pay-in-advance subscription fees are deferred and recognized as services are rendered.  Financial Services Revenue We record financial services revenue associated with sales-type/finance leases, operating leases, and notes receivable. Lease and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type/finance leases, we record an asset at lease inception. This asset is recorded at the aggregate future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized as Cost of services in the period in which the declines occur. For operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets, included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated residual value, using the straight-line method. We periodically review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense. For notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note. Reinsurance Revenue Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Astro Ltd., participates in a reinsurance pool for workers compensation. The member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $144, $139 and $122 during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were $142, $123 and $118 during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Revenues and costs are presented net in Cost of services in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fleet Support We provide assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation to the operators of all our commercial airplane models. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, and technical consulting support. This activity continues throughout the aircrafts operational life. Services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire models fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services. Research and Development Research and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design, testing, and bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers. Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with our contract accounting policy. We have certain research and development  arrangements that meet the requirement for best efforts research and development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expense rather than as contract revenues. We have established cost sharing arrangements with some suppliers for the 787 program. Our cost sharing arrangements state that the supplier contributions are for reimbursements of costs we incur for experimentation, basic design, and testing activities during the 787 development. In each arrangement, we retain substantial rights to the 787 part or component covered by the arrangement. The amounts received from these cost sharing arrangements are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses since we have no obligation to refund any amounts received per the arrangements regardless of the outcome of the development efforts. Specifically, under the terms of each agreement, payments received from suppliers for their share of the costs are typically based on milestones and are recognized as earned when we achieve the milestone events and no ongoing obligation on our part exists. In the event we receive a milestone payment prior to the completion of the milestone, the amount is classified in Accrued liabilities until earned. Share-Based Compensation We provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value net of estimated forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. Income Taxes Provisions for federal, state, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Earnings before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. Tax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of Income tax expense. Postretirement Plans The majority of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans. All nonunion and some union employees hired after December 31, 2008 are not covered by defined benefit plans. We also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employees annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset  return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). A portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and reflected in inventory at the end of a reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in Shareholders equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities we amortize them over the average future service period of employees. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Postemployment Plans We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated. Environmental Remediation We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations, and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup, and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be able to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable were $132 and $209 at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Inventories Inventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe benefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries and plant services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costs include amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one year. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering. Commercial aircraft programs inventory includes deferred production costs. Deferred production costs represent actual costs incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of  all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costs are experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor and other resources) than units produced later in a program because of volume efficiencies and the effects of learning. We expect that these deferred costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost of all units in the program. The determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision is recorded. The determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimate revenue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity. When estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. Used aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value. See Aircraft Valuation within this Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or market. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired inventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs. Included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the ability to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwise recoverable, it would be written off in the current period. We net advances and progress billings on long-term contracts against inventory in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Advances and progress billings in excess of related inventory are reported in Advances and billings in excess of related costs. Precontract Costs We may, from time to time, incur costs to begin fulfilling the statement of work under a specific anticipated contract that we are still negotiating with a customer. If we determine it is probable that we will be awarded the specific anticipated contract, then we capitalize the precontract costs we incur, excluding start-up costs which are expensed as incurred. Capitalized precontract costs are included in Inventories, net of advances and progress billings, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Should the contract not be awarded or otherwise determined to no longer be probable of award, the capitalized costs would be written off. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and equipment, from 3 to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements,  150% declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over five years. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition. Long-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Long-lived assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Asset Retirement Obligations We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material. We also have known conditional asset retirement obligations, such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liabilitys fair value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of brand and tradenames acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and tradenames. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology, from 4 to 14 years; product know-how, from 3 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 19 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 30 years; and other, from 1 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.  Investments Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost. The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between 20% and 50%. We classify investment income and loss on our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on whether the investment is operating or non-operating in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, including our share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from certain cost method investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic purposes. Earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on marketable securities, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in Other income/(expense), net. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them. We use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes in fair value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is to include in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For our cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported in Shareholders equity (as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss of a cash flow hedge is reported in earnings immediately. We also hold certain instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For these derivative instruments, the changes in their fair value are also recorded in earnings immediately. Aircraft Valuation Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments.  All trade-in commitments at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were solely attributable to Sale Aircraft and did not originate from contingent repurchase commitments. Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of: ##TABLE_START  (1)  adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recorded in Inventory and recognized upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  (2)  charges to cost of products for adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in Accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_END The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customers requirements; or the scrap market. Trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market. This quarterly valuation process yields results that are typically lower than residual value estimates by independent sources and tends to more accurately reflect results upon the actual placement of the aircraft. Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or market as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer financing. Assets under operating lease, assets held for sale or re-lease and collateral underlying receivables Customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivables, and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/finance leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary. We assess the fair value of the assets we own, including equipment under operating leases, assets held for sale or re-lease, and collateral underlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are less than the related assets carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fair values of sales-type/finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables. We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications. Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected  undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Allowance for losses on customer financing receivables We record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in our portfolio in a valuation account, the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivables portfolio. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to two components of receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables. We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the receivable agreement, without regard to any subsequent restructurings. Factors considered in assessing collectibility include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. We determine a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral we would expect to realize. We review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables (after excluding receivables subject to a specific impairment allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for each customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, for example, permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall. Each quarter we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables. Warranties In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material and design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a three  to four-year standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards under our authorization. These warranties are included in the programs estimate at completion. On occasion we have made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warranties issued by our BDS segments principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons hardware and are included in the contract cost estimates. These sales are generally accompanied by a six to twelve-month warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate. We provide guarantees to certain commercial airplane customers which include compensation provisions for failure to meet specified aircraft performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets, and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of the related aircraft. We have agreements that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to customers for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as a reduction in Cost of products at delivery of the related aircraft. These performance warranties and claims against suppliers are included in the programs estimate at completion. Supplier Penalties We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully anticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts. Guarantees We record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. For a residual value guarantee where we received a cash premium, the liability is equal to the cash premium received at the guarantees inception. For credit and performance guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditors default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable, for each future period the credit or performance guarantee will be outstanding. If at inception of a guarantee, we determine there is a probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value of the guarantee as described above or (b) the probable contingent loss amount. Note 2  Acquisitions Argon ST, Inc. On August 5, 2010, we acquired Argon ST, Inc. (Argon) for $782, net of cash acquired. Argon develops command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) and, combat systems. The acquisition was part of our strategy to expand our capabilities to address the C4ISR, cyber and intelligence markets. Argons results of operations from the acquisition  date are included in the Network  Space Systems (NSS) segment. Goodwill has been recorded in NSS, Global Services  Support (GSS) and Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA) segments. The final allocation of the purchase price is as follows: ##TABLE_START Accounts receivable  $ 66  Inventory   47  Property, plant and equipment   32  Goodwill   549  Finite-lived intangible assets (1)   216  Other assets   1  Accounts payable   (14 ) Accrued liabilities   (69 ) Advances and billings in excess of related costs   (8 ) Deferred income taxes   (38 ) Total net assets acquired   782   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)   Finite-lived intangible assets have a weighted average amortization period of 13 years and include $133 of Developed technology and $69 of Customer base. ##TABLE_END Vought Aircraft Industries Inc. On July 30, 2009, we acquired the business, assets and operations of Vought Aircraft Industries, Inc.s (Vought) 787 business conducted at North Charleston, South Carolina.

The gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization of our acquired finite-lived intangible assets were as follows at December 31: ##TABLE_START   2011   2010     Gross Carrying Amount   Accumulated Amortization   Gross Carrying Amount   Accumulated Amortization  Distribution rights  $ 1,915   $ 295   $ 1,661   $ 211  Product know-how   507    144    499    116  Customer base   606    253    603    208  Developed technology   833    684    834    653  Other   195    133    193    122  Total  $ 4,056   $ 1,509   $ 3,790   $ 1,310   ##TABLE_END Amortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $203 and $217. Estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding years is as follows: 2012  $209; 2013  $189; 2014  $183; 2015  $171 and 2016  $155. Non-cash investing and financing transactions related to acquired finite-lived intangibles during 2011 and 2010 were $256 and $62. Total acquired finite-lived intangibles of $335 and $529 remain unpaid as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.  Note 4  Earnings Per Share The weighted-average number of shares outstanding used to compute earnings per share are as follows: ##TABLE_START (Shares in millions) Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Weighted average shares outstanding   744.1    735.0    705.9  Participating securities   2.5    3.1    3.7  Basic weighted average shares outstanding   746.6    738.1    709.6  Dilutive potential common shares   6.5    6.2    3.8  Diluted weighted average shares outstanding   753.1    744.3    713.4   ##TABLE_END Basic earnings per share is calculated by the sum of (1) net earnings less declared dividends and dividend equivalents related to share-based compensation divided by the basic weighted average shares outstanding and (2) declared dividends and dividend equivalents related to share-based compensation divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. The weighted average number of shares outstanding, included in the table below, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the average market price did not exceed the exercise/threshold price. However, these shares may be dilutive potential common shares in the future. ##TABLE_START (Shares in millions) Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Stock options   21.1    14.9    16.8  Performance Awards   1.5    3.8    2.0  ShareValue Trust     13.2  Performance Shares     0.8  Stock Units     0.2   ##TABLE_END Note 5  Income Taxes The components of earnings before income taxes were: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  U.S.  $ 5,083   $ 4,310   $ 1,638  Non-U.S.   310    197    93  Total  $ 5,393   $ 4,507   $ 1,731   ##TABLE_END Income tax expense/(benefit) consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Current tax expense    U.S. federal  $ (605 )  $ 13   $ (132 ) Non-U.S.   93    80    69  U.S. state   (22 )   (137 )   145  Total current   (534 )   (44 )   82  Deferred tax expense    U.S. federal   1,856    969    457  Non-U.S.   (8 )   (13 )   (55 ) U.S. state   68    284    (88 ) Total deferred   1,916    1,240    314  Total income tax expense  $ 1,382   $ 1,196   $ 396   ##TABLE_END  Net income tax payments/(refunds) were $57, $360, and $(198) in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our effective income tax rate was 25.6%, 26.5%, and 22.9% for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our 2011 effective tax rate was lower than 2010, primarily due to an income tax charge of $150 recorded during the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Our 2010 effective tax rate was higher than 2009, primarily because pre-tax book income in 2010 was higher than in 2009 and because of the income tax charge of $150 recorded during the first quarter of 2010. This was partially offset by a tax benefit of $371 recorded during the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of settling the 1998-2003 federal audit. The following is a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% to our effective income tax rate: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  U.S. federal statutory tax   35.0 %   35.0 %   35.0 % Research and development credits   (2.7 )   (3.5 )   (10.1 ) Tax on international activities   (0.6 )   (1.2 )   (2.4 ) Tax deductible dividends   (0.8 )   (0.9 )   (2.2 ) State income tax provision, net of effect on U.S. federal tax   0.7    1.8    2.2  Medicare Part D law change    3.3   Federal audit settlement   (7.4 )   (8.2 )  Other provision adjustments   1.4    0.2    0.4  Effective income tax rate   25.6 %   26.5 %   22.9 %  ##TABLE_END During the fourth quarter of 2011, a tax benefit of $397 was recorded as a result of settling the 2004-2006 federal tax audit. During the fourth quarter we received an audit report for the 2007-2008 IRS examination for which we are filing an appeal. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2001-2011 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years. Significant components of our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010  Retiree health care accruals  $ 2,820   $ 3,061  Inventory and long-term contract methods of income recognition, fixed assets and other (net of valuation allowance of $27 and $27)   (5,189 )   (2,644 ) Partnerships and joint ventures   (228 )   (263 ) Other employee benefits accruals   1,352    1,272  In-process research and development related to acquisitions   51    65  Net operating loss, credit and capital loss carryovers (net of valuation allowance of $74 and $78)   488    300  Pension asset   5,315    3,443  Customer and commercial financing   (1,471 )   (1,645 ) Unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries   (66 )   (60 ) Other net unrealized losses   69    13  Net deferred tax assets (1)  $ 3,141   $ 3,542   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)   Of the deferred tax asset for net operating loss and credit carryovers, $336 expires in years ending from December 31, 2012 through December 31, 2031 and $152 may be carried over indefinitely. ##TABLE_END  Net deferred tax assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010  Deferred tax assets  $ 16,181   $ 14,383  Deferred tax liabilities   (12,939 )   (10,736 ) Valuation allowance   (101 )   (105 ) Net deferred tax assets  $ 3,141   $ 3,542   ##TABLE_END The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Included in the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2011 and 2010 are deferred tax assets in the amounts of $9,743 and $8,186 related to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We have provided for U.S. deferred income taxes and foreign withholding tax in the amount of $66 on undistributed earnings not considered permanently reinvested in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding tax on the remainder of undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested and it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that may be payable upon distribution. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position were as follows: interest of $48 and $170 and penalties of $10 and $12. The amounts of interest (benefit)/expense were ($94), ($105), and $45 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The interest benefits recorded during 2011 and 2010 were primarily related to the 2004-2006 and 1998-2003 federal audit settlements. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010   2009  Unrecognized tax benefits  January 1  $ 1,198   $ 1,787   $ 1,453  Gross increases  tax positions in prior periods   154    95    219  Gross decreases  tax positions in prior periods   (383 )   (465 )   (31 ) Gross increases  current-period tax positions   28    76    148  Gross decreases  current-period tax positions   (15 )   (40 )  Settlements   (42 )   (254 )  Lapse of statute of limitations   (1 )   (1 )   (2 ) Unrecognized tax benefits  December 31  $ 939   $ 1,198   $ 1,787   ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $939, $1,198, and $1,787 of which $838, $1,074, and $1,452 would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. As of December 31, 2011, these amounts are primarily associated with U.S. federal tax issues such as the amount of research and development tax credits claimed, the domestic production activities deductions claimed, and U.S. taxation of foreign earnings. Also included in these amounts are accruals for domestic state tax issues such as the allocation of income among various state tax jurisdictions and the amount of state tax credits claimed. The research and development credit expired on December 31, 2011. Members of Congress have introduced bills that would extend the credit. If the Research and Development credit is not extended there would be an unfavorable impact to our 2012 effective income tax rate. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Research and Development credit reduced our effective tax rate by 2.7%, 3.5%, and 10.1%, respectively.  Note 6  Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010  U.S. government contracts  $ 2,950   $ 2,969  Commercial customers   1,390    1,241  Reinsurance receivables   585    487  Non-U.S. military contracts   553    514  Other   368    253  Less valuation allowance   (53 )   (42 ) Total  $ 5,793   $ 5,422   ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes our accounts receivable under long-term contracts that were not billable or related to outstanding claims as of December 31: ##TABLE_START    Unbillable   Claims     2011   2010   2011   2010  Current  $ 1,174   $ 994   $ 49   $ 30  Expected to be collected after one year   498    507    209    194  Total  $ 1,672   $ 1,501   $ 258   $ 224   ##TABLE_END Under contract accounting unbillable receivables on long-term contracts arise when the sales or revenues based on performance attainment, though appropriately recognized, cannot be billed yet under terms of the contract as of the balance sheet date. Any adjustment for the credit quality of unbillable receivables, if required, would be recorded as a direct reduction of revenue. Factors considered in assessing the collectability of unbillable receivables include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. Unbillable receivables related to commercial customers expected to be collected after one year were $192 and $213 at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Accounts receivable related to claims are items that we believe are earned, but are subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate realization. Accounts receivable, other than those described above, expected to be collected after one year are not material. Note 7  Inventories Inventories at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010  Long-term contracts in progress  $ 13,587   $ 14,400  Commercial aircraft programs   35,080    26,550  Commercial spare parts, used aircraft, general stock materials and other   7,832    5,788  Inventory before advances and progress billings   56,499    46,738  Less advances and progress billings   (24,259 )   (22,421 ) Total  $ 32,240   $ 24,317   ##TABLE_END  Long-Term Contracts in Progress Long-term contracts in progress included Delta launch program inventory that will be sold at cost to United Launch Alliance (ULA) under an inventory supply agreement that terminates on March 31, 2021. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the inventory balance was $1,085 and $1,385. As of December 31, 2011, $739 of this inventory relates to yet unsold launches. ULA is continuing to assess the future of the Delta II program. In the event ULA is unable to sell additional Delta II inventory, our earnings could be reduced by up to $58. See Note 13. Inventory balances included $236 subject to claims or other uncertainties relating to the A-12 program as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. See Note 21. Capitalized precontract costs of $1,728 and $527 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, are included in long-term contracts in progress inventories. Commercial Aircraft Programs As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 787 program: $16,098 and $9,461 of work in process (including deferred production costs at December 31, 2011 of $10,753), $1,770 and $1,956 of supplier advances, and $1,914 and $1,447 of unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs. At December 31, 2011, $9,168 of 787 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and $3,499 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. Commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 747 program: $448 of deferred production costs at December 31, 2011, net of previously recorded reach-forward losses, and $852 and $879 of unamortized tooling costs at December 31, 2011 and 2010. During the third quarter of 2011, we reclassified $1,934 of previously recorded reach-forward losses on the 747 program from Accrued liabilities to Inventories, net of advances and progress billings. At December 31, 2011, $903 of 747 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and $397 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. Commercial aircraft program inventory included amounts credited in cash or other consideration (early issue sales consideration), to airline customers totaling $2,564 and $1,970 at December 31, 2011 and 2010. As a normal course of our Commercial Airplanes segment production process, our inventory may include a small quantity of airplanes that are completed but unsold. As of December 31, 2011, these aircraft were valued at $509. As of December 31, 2010 the value of completed but unsold aircraft in inventory was insignificant.  Note 8  Customer Financing Customer financing at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010  Financing receivables:   Investment in sales-type/finance leases  $ 2,037   $ 2,272  Notes   814    480  Operating lease equipment, at cost, less accumulated depreciation of $765 and $847   1,991    2,281  Gross customer financing   4,842    5,033  Less allowance for losses on receivables   (70 )   (353 ) Total  $ 4,772   $ 4,680   ##TABLE_END The components of investment in sales-type/finance leases at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010  Minimum lease payments receivable  $ 2,272   $ 2,879  Estimated residual value of leased assets   541    619  Unearned income   (776 )   (1,226 ) Total  $ 2,037   $ 2,272   ##TABLE_END Operating lease equipment primarily includes large commercial jet aircraft and regional jet aircraft. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, operating lease equipment included $521 and $583 of equipment available for sale or re-lease. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had firm lease commitments for $476 and $28 of this equipment. When our Commercial Airplanes segment is unable to immediately sell used aircraft, it may place the aircraft under an operating lease. It may also provide customer financing with a note receivable. The carrying amount of the Commercial Airplanes segment used aircraft under operating leases and notes receivable included as a component of customer financing totaled $357 and $167 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Financing receivable balances evaluated for impairment at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010  Individually evaluated for impairment  $ 854   $ 99  Collectively evaluated for impairment   1,997    2,653  Total financing receivables  $ 2,851   $ 2,752   ##TABLE_END Of the $854 and $99 of financing receivables individually evaluated for impairment as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, $485 and $0, were classified as impaired. We recorded no allowance for losses on these impaired receivables. The average recorded investment in impaired financing receivables for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, was $517, $88 and $162, respectively. Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Income is recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer. As of December 31, 2011, we had no interest income recognized on such receivables and $9 and $9 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The change in the allowance for losses on financing receivables for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010   2009  Beginning balance  January 1  $ (353 )  $ (302 )  $ (269 ) Customer financing valuation benefit/(provision)   269    (51 )   (45 ) Reduction in customer financing assets   14        12  Ending balance  December 31  $ (70 )  $ (353 )  $ (302 )  Individually evaluated for impairment    $ (2 ) Collectively evaluated for impairment  $ (70 )  $ (353 )   (300 )  ##TABLE_END We assign internal credit ratings for all customers and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We utilize these credit ratings as one of the factors in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for losses on receivables. Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies. The customer financing valuation benefit recorded in 2011 was primarily driven by changes in the internal credit rating categories assigned to our receivable balances from AirTran Holdings, LLC (AirTran). The following table details our financing receivable balances at December 31, by the internal credit rating category which was used as a factor in determining our allowance for losses on receivables. ##TABLE_START Rating categories  2011   2010  BBB  $ 1,316   BB   67   B   103   $ 207  CCC   512    2,432  D   653   Other   200    113  Total carrying value of financing receivables  $ 2,851   $ 2,752   ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2011, our allowance primarily related to receivables with ratings of BBB and CCC and we applied default rates that averaged 4% and 48% to exposure associated with those receivables. On May 2, 2011, Southwest Airlines Co. (Southwest) completed its acquisition of AirTran Holdings, Inc. and AirTran Holdings, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest. AirTran became the successor to AirTran Holdings, Inc. As a result, we took into account Southwests credit rating when we determined the allowance for losses on AirTran receivables during 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we revised the contractual terms of our leases with AirTran in conjunction with receiving a full guarantee from Southwest which guaranteed AirTrans obligations to BCC. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we assigned the internal rating categories of BBB and CCC to the receivables from AirTran for the purpose of assigning default rates discussed above. The improved rating in 2011 reduced the allowance for losses on receivables by $241 for the year ended December 31, 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2011, American Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. We believe that our customer financing receivables from American Airlines of $653 are sufficiently collateralized such that we do not expect to incur losses related to those receivables as a result of the bankruptcy. Declines in collateral values are also a significant driver of our allowance for losses. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have had greater percentages of collateral value declines than in-production aircraft. Our portfolio consists primarily of financing receivables for out-of-production aircraft.  As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no material receivables that were greater than 30 days past due. Customer Financing Exposure Customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance and may be subject to reduced valuation with market decline. Our customer financing portfolio has a concentration of various model aircraft. Customer financing carrying values related to major aircraft concentrations at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010  717 Aircraft ($480 and $561 accounted for as operating leases) (1)  $ 1,906   $ 2,070  757 Aircraft ($451 and $629 accounted for as operating leases) (1)   631    720  737 Aircraft ($242 and $317 accounted for as operating leases)   394    366  767 Aircraft ($103 and $115 accounted for as operating leases)   307    372  MD-11 Aircraft ($321 and $327 accounted for as operating leases) (1)   321    327   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)   Out of production aircraft ##TABLE_END Charges related to customer financing asset impairment for the years ended December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010   2009  Boeing Capital Corporation  $ 109   $ 85   $ 91  Other Boeing   (36 )   85    8  Total  $ 73   $ 170   $ 99   ##TABLE_END Scheduled receipts on customer financing are as follows: ##TABLE_START Year  2012   2013   2014   2015   2016   Beyond 2016  Principal payments on notes receivable  $ 243   $ 196   $ 105   $ 52   $ 37   $ 181  Sales-type/finance lease payments receivable   326    285    226    225    221    989  Operating lease equipment payments receivable   219    185    164    153    84    125   ##TABLE_END Customer financing assets leased under capital leases and subleased to others were not significant in 2011 and 2010. Note 9  Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010  Land  $ 526   $ 542  Buildings and land improvements   10,285    9,695  Machinery and equipment   11,353    11,002  Construction in progress   1,142    1,014  Gross property, plant and equipment   23,306    22,253  Less accumulated depreciation   (13,993 )   (13,322 ) Total  $ 9,313   $ 8,931   ##TABLE_END  Depreciation expense was $1,119, $1,096 and $1,066 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $57, $48 and $90, respectively. Rental expense for leased properties was $270, $269 and $273, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2011, minimum rental payments under capital leases aggregated $197. Minimum rental payments under operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more aggregated $1,311, net of sublease payments of $4, at December 31, 2011. Non-cancellable future rentals due from customers for equipment on operating leases aggregated $105 at December 31, 2011. Payments due under operating and capital leases net of sublease amounts, and non-cancellable future rentals during the next five years are as follows: ##TABLE_START    2012   2013   2014   2015   2016  Minimum operating lease payments, net of sublease amounts  $ 202   $ 180   $ 152   $ 100   $ 81  Future rentals due from customers for equipment on operating leases   15    14    13    13    10  Minimum capital lease payments, net of sublease amounts   91    73    25    6    1   ##TABLE_END Accounts payable related to purchases of property, plant and equipment were $200 and $265 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Note 10  Investments Our investments, which are recorded in Short-term and other investments or Investments, consisted of the following at December 31: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010  Time deposits  $ 1,134   $ 5,100  Pledged money market funds (1)   56    57  Available-for-sale investments   10    15  Equity method investments   1,003    1,072  Restricted Cash (2)   31   Other investments   32    25  Total  $ 2,266   $ 6,269   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)   Reflects amounts pledged in lieu of letters of credit as collateral in support of our workers compensation programs.

The $356 includes $147 related to a payment made by us under a bank guarantee on behalf of Sea Launch and $209 related to loans (partner loans) we made to Sea Launch. The net amounts owed to Boeing by each of the partners are as follows; S.P. Koroley Rocket and Space Corporation Energia of Russia  $223, PO Yuzhnoye Mashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukraine  $89 and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine  $44. Although each partner is contractually obligated to reimburse us for its share of the bank guarantee, the Russian and Ukrainian partners have raised defenses to enforcement and contested our claims. On October 19, 2009, we filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launch partners of the $147 bank guarantee payment. On October 7, 2010, the arbitrator ruled that the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter but did not resolve the merits of our claim. We filed a notice appealing the arbitrators ruling on January 11, 2011. No legal proceedings have commenced against the partners on the partner loans. We believe the partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and remedies. In the event we are unable to secure reimbursement of $147 related to our payment under the bank guarantee and $209 related to loans made to Sea Launch, we could incur additional pre-tax charges of up to $356. Note 12  Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010  Accrued Compensation and employee benefit costs  $ 5,546   $ 5,193  Environmental   758    721  Product warranties   1,046    1,076  Forward loss recognition (1)   501    2,743  Other   4,388    4,069  Total  $ 12,239   $ 13,802   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)   Forward loss recognition in 2011 relates primarily to the Airborne Early Warning and Control program (AEWC). $1,934 of loss related to the 747 Program included in the 2010 balance was reclassified to inventory during 2011. ##TABLE_END Environmental The following table summarizes environmental remediation during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. ##TABLE_START    2011   2010  Beginning balance  January 1  $ 721   $ 706  Reductions for payments made   (118 )   (93 ) Changes in estimates   155    108  Ending balance  December 31  $ 758   $ 721   ##TABLE_END  The liabilities recorded represent our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred to remediate sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and the discovery of additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios which include the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. There are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by $1,003 and $957. Product Warranties The following table summarizes product warranty activity recorded for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. ##TABLE_START    2011   2010  Beginning balance  January 1  $ 1,076   $ 999  Additions for current year deliveries   232    141  Reductions for payments made   (269 )   (234 ) Changes in estimates   7    170  Ending balance  December 31  $ 1,046   $ 1,076   ##TABLE_END Commercial Aircraft Commitments In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into specified-price trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. The total contractual trade-in value was $273 and $295 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. We anticipate that a significant portion of these commitments will not be exercised by customers. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and take into consideration the current economic environment. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer. The fair value of trade-in aircraft related to probable contractual trade-in commitments was $27 and $30 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Trade-in commitment agreements have expiration dates from 2012 through 2023.  Financing Commitments Financing commitments totaled $15,866 and $9,865 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. The estimated earliest potential funding dates for these commitments as of December 31, 2011 are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Total  2012  $ 1,562  2013   1,207  2014   2,217  2015   3,639  2016   2,475  Thereafter   4,766   $ 15,866   ##TABLE_END Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds We have entered into standby letters of credit agreements and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $6,199 and $7,599 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Commitments to ULA We and Lockheed have each committed to provide ULA with up to $352 of additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. See Note 7. C-17 At December 31, 2011, our backlog included 3 C-17 aircraft currently under contract with the U.S. Air Force (USAF) as well as international orders for 2 aircraft. The probable orders, not under contract at December 31, 2011, totaled 19 aircraft of which 13 were for international customers and 6 for the USAF. USAF orders included 5 aircraft for which a contract was received in January 2012 and 1 aircraft which was funded in the Fiscal Year 2012 Defense Appropriations Act. At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $940 of inventory expenditures and potential termination liabilities to suppliers associated with probable orders, of which $870 was related to the 5 USAF orders and 12 international orders received in January and February 2012. We completed the planned production rate decrease from 15 aircraft per year to 10 per year during the third quarter of 2011. The associated reduction in headcount resulted in pension curtailment charges of $34 in the first quarter of 2011. Should additional orders not materialize, it is reasonably possible that we will decide in 2012 to end production of the C-17 at a future date. We are still evaluating the full financial impact of a potential production shut-down, including additional pension curtailment charges, and any recovery that would be available from the U.S. government. Such recovery from the U.S. government would not include the costs incurred by us resulting from our direction to suppliers to begin working on aircraft beyond those currently under contract with the USAF. F-15 At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $2,275 of inventory expenditures and potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to the production of F-15 aircraft not currently under contract.  On December 29 th , 2011, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the U.S. government announced the signing of a letter of offer and acceptance for a foreign military sale for 84 new F-15SE Eagle fighters and associated products and services. We expect this order to be under contract in 2012. Company Owned Life Insurance McDonnell Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life insurance policies with a cash surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the cash surrender value was $397 and $381 and the total loans were $377 and $363. As we have the right to offset the loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Note 13  Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees. The following tables provide quantitative data regarding our third party guarantees. The maximum potential payments represent a worst-case scenario, and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset our payments under guarantees. The carrying amount of liabilities represents the amount included in Accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_START    Maximum Potential Payments   Estimated Proceeds from Collateral/ Recourse   Carrying Amount of Liabilities  December 31,  2011   2010   2011   2010   2011   2010  Contingent repurchase commitments  $ 3,290   $ 3,782   $ 3,290   $ 3,759   $ 7   $ 7  Indemnifications to ULA:       Contributed Delta program launch inventory   215    187      Contract pricing   261    261      7    7  Other Delta contracts   137    83      8    16  Other indemnifications   212    232      51    82  Credit guarantees   17    71    12    63    2    6  Residual value guarantees   29    29    21    21    6    6   ##TABLE_END Contingent Repurchase Commitments We have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers in conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft. Under these commitments, we agreed to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and the subsequent exercise by the customer of its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us. The repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase commitments is generally lower than the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated Proceeds from Collateral/Recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date. Indemnifications to ULA We agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 of Boeing Delta launch program inventory included in contributed assets plus $1,860 of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on  March 31, 2021. Since inception, ULA has consumed $1,211 of inventory that was contributed by us. ULA has made advance payments of $720 to us and we have recorded revenues and cost of sales of $483 under the inventory supply agreement through December 31, 2011. ULA is continuing to assess the future of the Delta II program beyond what is currently on contract. In the event ULA is unable to sell additional Delta II inventory, our earnings could be reduced by up to $58. In June 2011, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) notified ULA that it had determined that $271 of deferred support costs are not recoverable under government contracts. In December 2011, the DCMA notified ULA of the potential non-recoverability of an additional $114 of deferred production costs. The DCMA has not yet issued a final decision related to the recoverability of the $114. ULA and Boeing believe that all costs are recoverable and in November 2011, ULA filed a certified claim with the USAF for collection of deferred support and production costs. ULA has until June 2012 to file a suit with the Court of Federal Claims for collection of deferred support costs. If, contrary to our belief, it is determined that some or all of the deferred support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record pre-tax losses and make indemnification payments to ULA for up to $317 of the costs questioned by the DCMA. We agreed to indemnify ULA against potential losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the USAF for four satellite missions. We believe ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing. In December 2008, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value for two satellite missions. In March 2009, the USAF issued a denial of that claim. In June 2009, ULA filed a notice of appeal, and in October 2009, ULA filed a complaint before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) for a contract adjustment for the price of the two satellite missions. In September 2009, the USAF exercised its option for a third satellite mission. During the third quarter of 2010, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value of the third mission. The USAF did not exercise an option for a fourth mission prior to the expiration. In March 2011, ULA filed a notice of appeal before the ASBCA, seeking to re-price the third mission. A hearing before the ASBCA has been scheduled for May 6, 2013. If ULA is unsuccessful in obtaining additional pricing, we may be responsible for a portion of the shortfall and may record up to $279 in pre-tax losses associated with the three missions, representing up to $261 for the indemnification payment and up to $18 for our portion of additional contract losses incurred by ULA. Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees, principally to facilitate the sale and/or financing of commercial aircraft. Under these arrangements, we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that lease or loan payments are not made by the original lessee or debtor or certain specified services are not performed. A substantial portion of these guarantees has been extended on behalf of original lessees or debtors with less than investment-grade credit. Our commercial aircraft credit guarantees are collateralized by the underlying commercial aircraft and certain other assets. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire within the next nine years. Residual Value Guarantees We have issued various residual value guarantees principally to facilitate the sale and financing of certain commercial aircraft. Under these guarantees, we are obligated to make payments to the guaranteed party if the related aircraft or equipment fair values fall below a specified amount at a future time. These obligations are collateralized principally by the underlying commercial aircraft and expire within the next seven years. Other Indemnifications As part of the 2004 sale agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation related to the sale of Boeing Capital Corporations (BCC) Commercial Financial Services business, BCC is involved in a loss sharing arrangement for losses on transferred portfolio assets, such as asset sales, provisions for loss or asset impairment charges offset by gains from asset sales. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, our maximum future cash exposure to losses associated with the loss sharing arrangement was $212 and $232 and our accrued liability under the loss sharing arrangement was $51 and $82.  In conjunction with our sales of the Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and the sale of our Commercial Airplanes facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma in 2005, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental contamination and certain other items. As it is impossible to assess whether there will be damages in the future or the amounts thereof (if any), we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities. Therefore, no liability has been recorded. There have been no claims submitted to date. Industrial Revenue Bonds Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRBs) issued by the City of Wichita were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property at our Wichita site. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a ten-year property tax abatement and a sales tax exemption from the Kansas Department of Revenue. We record the property on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, along with a capital lease obligation to repay the proceeds of the IRB. We have also purchased the IRBs and therefore are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the property purchased with the IRB proceeds. The capital lease obligation and IRB asset are recorded net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the net assets associated with the City of Wichita IRBs were $783 and $822. Note 14  Debt On August 1, 2011, BCC issued notes totaling $750, which included $500 bearing an interest rate of 2.125% due August 15, 2016 and $250 bearing an interest rate of 2.90% due August 15, 2018. The net proceeds after deducting the discount, underwriting fees and issuance costs were $745. The notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of BCCs existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Total debt interest incurred, including amounts capitalized, was $683, $729 and $610 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest expense recorded by BCC is reflected as a separate line item on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and is included in Earnings from operations. Total Company interest payments were $626, $670 and $502 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We have $4,600 currently available under credit line agreements, of which $2,300 is a 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in November 2012 and $2,300 is a five-year credit facility expiring in November 2016. The 364-day credit facility has a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration date. We have given BCC exclusive access to $750 under the 364-day facility and $750 under the five-year facility. We continue to be in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt or credit facility agreements, including those at BCC. Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2011       2010         Consolidated Total   BCC Only   Consolidated Total   BCC Only  Unsecured debt securities  $ 2,186   $ 837   $ 785   $ 785  Non-recourse debt and notes   45    32    79    6  Capital lease obligations   97    10    62    10  Other notes   25        22      Total  $ 2,353   $ 879   $ 948   $ 801   ##TABLE_END  Debt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010  Boeing Capital Corporation debt:   Unsecured debt securities   1.78%  7.58% due through 2023  $ 3,308   $ 3,339  Non-recourse debt and notes   1.37%  5.79% notes due through 2013   49    55  Capital lease obligations   1.14% due through 2015   43    52  Boeing Capital Corporation debt subtotal  $ 3,400   $ 3,446   Other Boeing debt:   Unsecured debt securities   1.88%  5.00% due through 2020  $ 3,381   $ 3,376  5.13%  6.88% due through 2043   2,990    2,988  7.25%  9.75% due through 2043   1,991    1,991  Non-recourse debt and notes   Enhanced equipment trust   269    342  Capital lease obligations due through 2017   192    135  Other notes   148    143  Other Boeing debt subtotal  $ 8,971   $ 8,975  Total debt  $ 12,371   $ 12,421   ##TABLE_END Other Boeing debt includes $300 bearing an interest rate of 7.95% due August 15, 2024 that may be redeemed at the holders option on August 15, 2012 and is classified in Current liabilities. At December 31, 2011, $361 of debt (non-recourse debt and notes and capital lease obligations) was collateralized by customer financing assets totaling $592. Scheduled principal payments for debt and capital lease obligations for the next five years are as follows: ##TABLE_START    2012   2013   2014   2015   2016  Boeing Capital Corporation  $ 878   $ 653   $ 526   $ 16   $ 505  Other Boeing   1,478    705    798    824    536  Total  $ 2,356   $ 1,358   $ 1,324   $ 840   $ 1,041   ##TABLE_END Note 15  Postretirement Plans The majority of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans. All nonunion and some union employees hired after December 31, 2008 are not covered by defined benefit plans. We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans participants, and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for future benefit payments. We also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for approximately half those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered by most United Auto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage.  The funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). We have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Pension plan assets, net, and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in Accrued liabilities. The components of net periodic benefit cost are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Pension   Other Postretirement Plans  Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009   2011   2010   2009  Service cost  $ 1,406   $ 1,176   $ 1,090   $ 221   $ 121   $ 132  Interest cost   3,116    3,002    2,964    484    404    466  Expected return on plan assets   (3,741 )   (3,850 )   (3,738 )   (6 )   (6 )   (5 ) Amortization of prior service costs   244    248    242    (96 )   (78 )   (90 ) Recognized net actuarial loss   1,254    777    650    178    56    92  Settlement/curtailment/transfer loss   64    14    13    3          Net periodic benefit cost  $ 2,343   $ 1,367   $ 1,221   $ 784   $ 497   $ 595   Net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations  $ 1,648   $ 1,101   $ 879   $ 692   $ 480   $ 615   ##TABLE_END During the quarter ended September 30, 2011, we determined the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for certain other postretirement benefit plans was understated. As a result, we recognized an additional $294 of postretirement benefit obligations at September 30, 2011. This increased net periodic benefit cost during 2011 by $184, which includes service cost of $73, interest cost of $68 and recognized net actuarial loss of $43. Had the understatement been recorded at December 31, 2010, the postretirement benefit obligation would have increased by $274 from $8,546 to $8,820. Management believes that these understatements were not material to the current period or prior periods. Under our accounting policy, a portion of net periodic benefit cost is allocated to production as inventoried costs. Of the $184 increase in net periodic benefit cost described above, the associated cost included in Earnings from operations was $161 for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, with the remaining cost of $23 classified as inventory.  The following tables show changes in the benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status of both pensions and OPB for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Benefit obligation balances presented below reflect the PBO for our pension plans, and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations (APBO) for our OPB plans. ##TABLE_START    Pension   Other Postretirement Benefits     2011   2010   2011   2010  Change in benefit obligation     Beginning balance  $ 59,106   $ 52,166   $ 8,546   $ 7,576  Service cost   1,406    1,176    221    121  Interest cost   3,116    3,002    484    404  Plan participants contributions   9    9    Amendments   186    142    (719 )   (130 ) Actuarial (gain)/loss   6,586    5,243    (63 )   1,061  Settlement/curtailment/acquisitions/dispositions, net   (104 )   (93 )   3    32  Gross benefits paid   (2,644 )   (2,567 )   (503 )   (555 ) Medicare Part D subsidy     31    31  Exchange rate adjustment   (10 )   28    (3 )   6  Ending balance  $ 67,651   $ 59,106   $ 7,997   $ 8,546   Change in plan assets     Beginning balance at fair value  $ 49,252   $ 45,810   $ 98   $ 89  Actual return on plan assets   3,953    5,979    4    11  Company contribution   531    35    17    15  Plan participants contributions   9    9    3    2  Settlement/curtailment/acquisitions/dispositions, net   (104 )   (98 )   Benefits paid   (2,581 )   (2,507 )   (20 )   (19 ) Exchange rate adjustment   (9 )   24          Ending balance at fair value  $ 51,051   $ 49,252   $ 102   $ 98   Amounts recognized in Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at December 31 consist of:     Pension plan assets, net  $ 1   $ 6    Other accrued liabilities   (64 )   (60 )  $ (375 )  $ (423 ) Accrued retiree health care     (7,520 )   (8,025 ) Accrued pension plan liability, net   (16,537 )   (9,800 )         Net amount recognized  $ (16,600 )  $ (9,854 )  $ (7,895 )  $ (8,448 )  ##TABLE_END Amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Pension   Other Postretirement Benefits     2011   2010   2011   2010  Net actuarial loss  $ 24,448   $ 19,343   $ 1,885   $ 2,148  Prior service cost/(credit)   1,118    1,225    (1,008 )   (384 ) Total recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss  $ 25,566   $ 20,568   $ 877   $ 1,764   ##TABLE_END  The estimated amount that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during the year ended December 31, 2012 is as follows: ##TABLE_START    Pensions   Other Postretirement Benefits  Recognized net actuarial loss  $ 1,935   $ 123  Amortization of prior service costs/(credits)   226    (197 ) Total  $ 2,161   $ (74 )  ##TABLE_END The ABO for all pension plans was $61,902 and $53,513 at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Key information for our plans with ABO in excess of plan assets as of December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010  Projected benefit obligation  $ 67,418   $ 58,772  Accumulated benefit obligation   61,675    53,202  Fair value of plan assets   50,820    48,926   ##TABLE_END The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 increased our APBO by $300 at December 31, 2010. This includes the impact of the excise tax on high cost health plans scheduled to become payable beginning in 2018. This increase is recognized as an actuarial loss and is amortized over the expected future service of current employees. Assumptions The following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31 of each year and the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year. ##TABLE_START December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Discount rate:    Pension   4.40 %   5.30 %   5.80 % Other postretirement benefits   4.00 %   4.90 %   5.40 % Expected return on plan assets   7.75 %   7.75 %   8.00 % Rate of compensation increase   3.90 %   5.20 %   5.50 %  ##TABLE_END The discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high quality bonds that are rated as Aa or better by Moodys as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yields developed from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. A portfolio of about 400 bonds is used to construct the yield curve. Since corporate bond yields are generally not available at maturities beyond 30 years, it is assumed that spot rates will remain level beyond that 30-year point. The present value of each plans benefits is calculated by applying the spot/discount rates to projected benefit cash flows. All bonds are U.S. issues, with a minimum outstanding of $50. The pension funds expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns,  the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the upcoming plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five-year moving average of plan assets. As of December 31, 2011, the MRVA is approximately $790 less than the fair market value of assets. Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows: ##TABLE_START December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Health care cost trend rate assumed next year   7.50 %   7.50 %   7.00 % Ultimate trend rate   5.00 %   5.00 %   5.00 % Year that trend reached ultimate rate   2018    2018    2014   ##TABLE_END Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. To determine the health care cost trend rates we look at a combination of information including ongoing claims cost monitoring, annual statistical analyses of claims data, reconciliation of forecast claims against actual claims, review of trend assumptions of other plan sponsors and national health trends, and adjustments for plan design changes, workforce changes, and changes in plan participant behavior. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect: ##TABLE_START    Increase   Decrease  Effect on total of service and interest cost  $ 63   $ (54 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation   642    (572 )  ##TABLE_END Plan Assets Investment Strategy The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive, total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified. We periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investment benchmarks for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions (such as private equity and real estate), and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced on a monthly basis.  The actual allocations for the pension assets at December 31 and target allocations by asset class, are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Percentage of Plan Assets   Target Allocations  Asset Class  2011   2010   2011   2010  Fixed income   53 %   49 %   49 %   45 % Global equity   26    33    30    28  Private equity   6    5    6    6  Real estate and real assets   6    5    6    10  Global strategies   4    4    4    5  Hedge funds   5    4    5    6  Total   100 %   100 %   100 %   100 %  ##TABLE_END Fixed income securities are invested broadly and primarily in long duration instruments. Global equity securities are invested broadly in U.S. and non-U.S. companies which are in various industries and countries and through a range of market capitalizations. Real estate and real assets include global private investments and publicly traded investments (such as REITs in the case of real estate). Real estate includes but is not limited to investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include but are not limited to investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber), commodities and infrastructure. Private equity investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) and fund-of-funds that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies. Global strategies seek to capitalize on inefficiencies identified across different asset classes or markets, primarily using long-short positions in derivatives and physical securities. Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to event driven, relative value, long-short and market neutral. A well-diversified number of hedge funds are held. Investment managers are retained for explicit investment roles specified by contractual investment guidelines. Certain investment managers are authorized to invest in derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve the desired market exposure of a security or an index, transfer value-added performance between asset classes, achieve the desired currency exposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation. As a percentage of total plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were 3.9% and 9.8% for fixed income, including to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and 3.5% and negative 0.2% for global equity and currency overlay at December 31, 2011 and 2010. In November 2009, the Company elected to contribute $1,500 of our common stock to the pension fund. An independent fiduciary was retained to manage and liquidate the stock over time at its discretion. The liquidation of the common stock holdings was completed during 2011. Risk Management In managing the plan assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability management and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach and are integral to the overall investment strategy. Further, asset classes are constructed to achieve diversification by investment strategy, by investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored regularly through the custodian. Credit parameters for counterparties have been established for managers permitted to trade over-the-counter derivatives.  Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs. ##TABLE_START    December 31, 2011   December 31, 2010     Total   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Total   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3  Fixed income securities:         Corporate  $ 13,921    $ 13,910   $ 11   $ 13,038    $ 13,034   $ 4  U.S. government and agencies   4,500     4,500     3,734     3,734   Mortgage backed and asset backed   714     703    11    880     847    33  Other   4,352   $ 215    4,134    3    3,469   $ 19    3,450   Derivatives:         Assets   25     25     18     18   Liabilities   (41 )    (41 )    (20 )    (20 )  Cash equivalents and other short-term investments   3,187    2,634    553     2,781    2,342    439   Currency overlay derivatives:         Assets   89     89     106     106   Liabilities   (94 )    (94 )    (121 )    (121 )  Equity securities:         U.S. common and preferred stock   4,837    4,837      4,925    4,925    Non-U.S. common and preferred stock   6,258    6,257    1     6,414    6,367    47   Boeing company stock       1,498    1,498    Common/collective/ pooled funds   2,235    27    2,208     3,097    105    2,992   Derivatives:         Assets   4    4      21     21   Liabilities   (5 )   (5 )     (11 )    (11 )  Private equity   2,869    10     2,859    2,636    10     2,626  Real estate and real assets   3,110    714    29    2,367    2,488    665    5    1,818  Global strategies   2,202     2,127    75    2,015    443    1,503    69  Hedge funds   2,451            2,451    1,918            1,918  Total  $ 50,614   $ 14,693   $ 28,144   $ 7,777   $ 48,886   $ 16,374   $ 26,044   $ 6,468   Cash  $ 206      $ 79     Receivables   503       393     Payables   (272 )               (106 )             Total  $ 51,051      $ 49,252      ##TABLE_END Fixed income securities are primarily valued using a market approach with inputs that include broker quotes, benchmark yields, base spreads and reported trades. Cash equivalents and other short-term investments, which are used to pay benefits, are primarily held in registered money market funds which are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Other cash equivalent and short-term investments are valued daily by the fund using a market approach with inputs that include quoted market prices for similar instruments.  Common and preferred stock equity securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Common/collective/pooled funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their net asset values (NAVs) that are calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Active currency managers, through an overlay program, invest in a broad set of currency derivatives. Derivatives leveled in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued using an income approach with inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates. Exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Private equity valuations are reported by the fund manager and are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. Real estate and real asset fund values are primarily reported by the fund manager and are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. Publically traded REITs and infrastructure stocks are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Global strategies are primarily limited liability company (LLC) or mutual fund structures. The LLCs are primarily valued using a market approach based on NAVs calculated by the fund and have monthly liquidity. Global strategies mutual funds are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Hedge funds consist of fund-of-fund LLC or commingled fund structures and direct hedge funds. The LLCs are primarily valued using a market approach based on NAVs calculated by the fund and are not publicly available. Liquidity for the LLCs is monthly and is subject to liquidity of the underlying hedge funds. The commingled fund NAV is calculated by the manager on a daily basis and has monthly liquidity. Direct hedge funds are primarily valued by each funds third party administrator based on valuation of the underlying securities and instruments and primarily applying a market or income valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument, equity, fixed income, currency or derivative, held. Direct hedge fund NAVs based on valuation of the underlying holdings are not publicly available and have monthly liquidity. Some of our assets, primarily our private equity, real estate and real assets, hedge funds and global strategies, do not have readily determinable market values given the specific investment structures involved and the nature of the underlying investments. For the December 31, 2011 and 2010 plan asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used where possible. For assets without readily determinable values, estimates were derived from investment manager discussions focusing on underlying fundamentals and significant events. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) we use net asset values, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events.  The following tables present a reconciliation of Level 3 assets held during the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Transfers into and out of Level 3 are treated as beginning of year values. ##TABLE_START    January 1, 2011 Balance   Net Realized and Unrealized Gains/(Losses)   Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements   Net Transfers Into/(Out of) Level 3   December 31, 2011 Balance  Fixed income securities:      Corporate  $ 4    $ 6   $ 1   $ 11  Mortgage backed and asset backed   33   $ 2    (25 )   1    11  Other     3     3  Private equity   2,626    327    (94 )    2,859  Real estate and real assets   1,818    246    303     2,367  Global strategies   69    6      75  Hedge funds   1,918    (52 )   585        2,451  Total  $ 6,468   $ 529   $ 778   $ 2   $ 7,777   ##TABLE_END For the year ended December 31, 2011, the change in unrealized gain/(loss) for Level 3 assets still held at December 31, 2011 were $234 for private equity, $287 for real estate and real assets and $(46) for hedge funds. ##TABLE_START    January 1, 2010 Balance   Net Realized and Unrealized Gains/(Losses)   Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements   Net Transfers Into/(Out of) Level 3   December 31, 2010 Balance  Fixed income securities:      Corporate  $ 5    $ (1 )   $ 4  Mortgage backed and asset backed   23   $ (1 )   15    (4 )   33  Private equity   2,291    379    (44 )    2,626  Real estate and real assets   1,337    157    324     1,818  Global strategies    (1 )   70     69  Hedge funds   1,011    92    815        1,918  Total  $ 4,667   $ 626   $ 1,179   $ (4 )  $ 6,468   ##TABLE_END For the year ended December 31, 2010, the change in unrealized gain for Level 3 assets still held at December 31, 2010 were $397 for private equity, $136 for real estate and real assets and $92 for hedge funds. OPB Plan Assets The majority of OPB plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised of approximately 60% equities and 40% debt securities. The index fund is valued using a market approach based on the quoted market price of an identical instrument (Level 1). The expected rate of return on these assets does not have a material effect on the net periodic benefit cost. Cash Flows Contributions Required pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) as well as rules governing funding of our non-U.S. pension plans, are expected to be minimal in 2012. We expect to make discretionary contributions to our plans of approximately $1,500 in 2012. We expect to contribute approximately $15 to our OPB plans in 2012.  Estimated Future Benefit Payments The table below reflects the total pension benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants share of the cost, which is funded by participant contributions. OPB payments reflect our portion only. ##TABLE_START Year(s)  2012   2013   2014   2015   2016   20172021  Pensions  $ 2,829   $ 2,979   $ 3,140   $ 3,313   $ 3,448   $ 19,501  Other postretirement benefits:       Gross benefits paid   498    520    545    570    599    3,351  Medicare Part D subsidy   (21 )   (22 )   (23 )   (24 )   (24 )   (126 ) Net other postretirement benefits  $ 477   $ 498   $ 522   $ 546   $ 575   $ 3,225   ##TABLE_END Termination Provisions Certain of the pension plans provide that, in the event there is a change in control of the Company which is not approved by the Board of Directors and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required by ERISA, and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits in our group insurance benefit programs. We have an agreement with the U.S. government with respect to certain pension plans. Under the agreement, should we terminate any of the plans under conditions in which the plans assets exceed that plans obligations, the U.S. government will be entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plans assets based on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts. Defined Contribution Plans We provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expense for these defined contribution plans was $658, $614 and $591 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Note 16  Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements Share-Based Compensation Our 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated effective February 21, 2011, permits awards of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, stock units, performance shares, performance units and other incentives to our employees, officers, consultants and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock available for issuance under the amended plan will not exceed 80,000,000 and no more than an aggregate of 16,000,000 shares are available for issuance as restricted stock awards. Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to meet any requirements to issue shares during 2012.  Share-based plans expense is primarily included in General and administrative expense since it is incentive compensation issued primarily to our executives. The share-based plans expense and related income tax benefit follow: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Stock options  $ 88   $ 96   $ 111  Restricted stock units and other awards   98    83    56  ShareValue Trust       36    71  Share-based plans expense  $ 186   $ 215   $ 238   Income tax benefit  $ 73   $ 83   $ 89   ##TABLE_END Stock Options In February 2011, 2010 and 2009, we granted to our executives 5,426,910, 5,932,806 and 7,423,242 options, respectively. The options have been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. The stock options granted after 2005 vest over a period of three years, with 34% vesting after the first year, 33% vesting after the second year and the remaining 33% vesting after the third year. If an executive terminates employment for any reason, the non-vested portion of the stock option will not vest and all rights to the non-vested portion will terminate completely. Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2011 is as follows: ##TABLE_START    Shares   Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share   Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years)   Aggregate Intrinsic Value  Number of shares under option:     Outstanding at beginning of year   28,975,442   $ 65.96    Granted   5,658,705    71.29    Exercised   (2,447,099 )   46.88    Forfeited   (665,482 )   61.11    Expired   (90,171 )   61.88          Outstanding at end of year   31,431,395   $ 68.52    6.58   $ 290  Exercisable at end of year   20,488,535   $ 71.77    5.51   $ 170   ##TABLE_END The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $67, $59 and $2 during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cash received from options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $114, $87 and $10 with a related tax benefit of $23, $20 and $1, respectively, derived from the compensation deductions resulting from these option exercises. At December 31, 2011, there was $89 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the Stock Option plan which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. The grant date fair value of stock options vested during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $92, $103 and $114, respectively.  The fair values of options were estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: ##TABLE_START Grant Year  Grant Date   Expected Life   Expected Volatility   Dividend Yield   Risk Free Interest Rate   Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share  2011   2/22/2011    6 years    29.8 %   2.3 %   2.5 %  $ 17.96  2010   2/22/2010    6 years    31.5 %   3.0 %   2.9 %  $ 15.70  2009   2/23/2009    6 years    39.0 %   2.4 %   2.0 %  $ 11.12   ##TABLE_END The expected volatility of the stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock volatility and the volatility levels implied on the grant date by actively traded option contracts on our common stock. We determined the expected term of the stock option grants to be six years, calculated using the simplified method in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 110. We use the simplified method since we changed the vesting terms, tax treatment and the recipients of our stock options beginning in 2006 such that we believe our historical data no longer provides a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term and we do not have enough option exercise data from our grants issued subsequent to 2006 to support our own estimate. Restricted Stock Units In February 2011, 2010 and 2009, we granted to our executives 1,364,440, 1,459,256 and 2,144,501 restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of $71.44, $63.83 and $35.57 per share, respectively. The RSUs vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will immediately vest on a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate completely. In addition to RSUs awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant RSUs to certain executives and employees to encourage retention or to reward various achievements. These RSUs are labeled other restricted stock units in the table below. The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average stock price on the date of grant. Stock units settle in common stock on a one-for-one basis and are not contingent upon stock price. Stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2011 is as follows: ##TABLE_START    Incentive Program Restricted Stock Units   Other Restricted Stock Units  Number of units:   Outstanding at beginning of year   3,425,800    1,701,951  Granted   1,421,906    197,526  Dividends   104,895    37,848  Forfeited   (152,608 )   (32,721 ) Distributed   (112,759 )   (410,436 ) Outstanding at end of year   4,687,234    1,494,168  Unrecognized compensation cost  $ 98   $ 23  Weighted average remaining contractual life (years)   1.8    1.9   ##TABLE_END  Other Compensation Arrangements Performance Awards Performance Awards are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a three-year period. Each unit has an initial value of $100 dollars per unit. The amount payable at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars per unit, depending on the Companys performance against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to pay these awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on the estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we granted Performance Awards to our executives with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals for each three-year period following the grant date. The minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out for the 2011, 2010 and 2009 Performance Awards is $265, $246 and $285, respectively. The 2009 grant is expected to be paid out in cash in March 2012. Deferred Compensation The Company has a deferred compensation plan which permits executives to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus, and certain other incentive awards. Participants can diversify deferred compensation among 19 investment funds including a Boeing stock unit account. Total expense related to deferred compensation was $59, $112 and $158 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred compensation liability which is being marked to market was $1,093 and $1,149. ShareValue Trust The ShareValue Trust, established July 1, 1996, was a 14-year irrevocable trust that held shares of our common stock, received dividends, and distributed to employees the appreciation in value above a 3% per annum threshold rate of return at the end of each period. The trust was terminated effective July 1, 2010 with the 29,948,920 undistributed shares returned to the Company. Note 17  Shareholders Equity On October 29, 2007, the Board approved the repurchase of up to $7,000 of common stock (the Program). Unless terminated earlier by a Board resolution, the Program will expire when we have used all authorized funds for repurchase. At December 31, 2011, $3,610 in shares may still be purchased under the Program. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were 1,200,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. No preferred stock has been issued.  Changes in Share Balances The following table shows changes in each class of shares: ##TABLE_START    Common Stock   Treasury Stock   ShareValue Trust  Balance January 1, 2009   1,012,261,159    285,661,944    28,460,769  Issued    (30,428,387 )  Acquired       1,173,152    1,102,555  Balance December 31, 2009   1,012,261,159    256,406,709    29,563,324  Issued    (9,353,570 )  Acquired     385,596  ShareValue Trust termination       29,948,920    (29,948,920 ) Balance December 31, 2010   1,012,261,159    277,002,059      Issued    (9,445,671 )  Acquired             Balance December 31, 2011   1,012,261,159    267,556,388    ##TABLE_END Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The components of Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010  Pension and postretirement adjustments  $ (16,755 )  $ (14,079 ) Unrealized gains on derivative instruments, net of reclassification adjustments   66    95  Unrealized losses on certain investments, net of reclassification adjustments   (8 )   (6 ) Foreign currency translation adjustments   197    232  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  $ (16,500 )  $ (13,758 )  ##TABLE_END Note 18  Derivative Financial Instruments Cash Flow Hedges Our cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, commodity swaps, and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage currency risk associated with certain transactions, specifically forecasted sales and purchases made in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency contracts hedge forecasted transactions principally occurring within five years in the future, with certain contracts hedging transactions up to 2021. We use commodity derivatives, such as swaps and fixed-price purchase commitments, to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. These include commitments to purchase electricity at fixed prices through 2016. Fair Value Hedges Interest rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt. The net change in fair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in BCC interest expense. Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment We also hold certain derivative instruments, primarily foreign currency forward contracts, for risk management purposes but without electing any form of hedge accounting.  Notional Amounts and Fair Values The notional amounts and fair values of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Notional amounts (1)   Other assets   Accrued liabilities     2011   2010   2011   2010   2011   2010  Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:       Foreign exchange contracts  $ 2,536   $ 2,001   $ 185   $ 266   $ (33 )  $ (15 ) Interest rate contracts   388    875    29    24    Commodity contracts   102    144      (112 )   (113 ) Derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment:       Foreign exchange contracts   605    646    2    8    (47 )   (58 ) Total derivatives   3,631    3,666    216    298    (192 )   (186 ) Netting arrangements           (61 )   (71 )   61    71  Net recorded balance    $ 155   $ 227   $ (131 )  $ (115 )  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)   Notional amounts represent the gross contract/notional amount of the derivatives outstanding. ##TABLE_END Gains/(losses) associated with our cash flow and undesignated hedging transactions and their effect on other comprehensive loss and Net earnings were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010  Effective portion recognized in other comprehensive loss, net of taxes:   Foreign exchange contracts  $ 12   $ 67  Commodity contracts   (25 )   (30 ) Effective portion reclassified out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings, net of taxes:   Foreign exchange contracts   42    25  Commodity contracts   (26 )   (16 ) Forward points recognized in Other income/(expense), net:   Foreign exchange contracts   37    (3 ) Undesignated derivatives recognized in Other income/(expense), net:   Foreign exchange contracts  $ (21 )  $ (33 )  ##TABLE_END Based on our portfolio of cash flow hedges, we expect to reclassify gains of $4 (pre-tax) out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings during the next 12 months. Ineffectiveness related to our hedges was insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. We have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. For foreign exchange contracts with original maturities of at least five years, our derivative counterparties could require settlement if we default on our five-year credit facility, expiring November 2016. For commodity contracts, our counterparties could require collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and commodity contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at December 31, 2011 was $39. At December 31, 2011, there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives.  Note 19  Significant Group Concentrations of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments involving potential credit risk are predominantly with commercial aircraft customers and the U.S. government. Of the $10,688 in gross accounts receivable and gross customer financing included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2011, $4,968 related predominantly to commercial aircraft customers ($660 of accounts receivable and $4,308 of customer financing) and $2,950 related to the U.S. government. Of the $4,842 in gross customer financing, $2,817 related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit including American Airlines, United/Continental Airlines, and Hawaiian Airlines who were associated with 14%, 9% and 8%, respectively, of our financing portfolio. Financing for aircraft is collateralized by security in the related asset and in some instances security in other assets as well. As of December 31, 2011, there was $15,866 of financing commitments related to aircraft on order including options and proposed as part of sales campaigns described in Note 12, of which $14,697 related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work. Significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEWC), India P-8I, USAF KC-46A Tanker and commercial and military satellites. The operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost and revenue estimates could also result in lower margins or a material charge for reach-forward losses in 2012. Commercial Airplane Development Programs The development and initial production of new commercial airplanes and new commercial airplane derivatives entail significant commitments to customers and suppliers as well as substantial investments in working capital, infrastructure and research and development. Performance issues or cost overruns on these programs, which currently include the 787 and 747-8, could have a material impact on our consolidated results and financial position in 2012. Other Risk As of December 31, 2011, approximately 37% of our total workforce was represented by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 13% of our total workforce was represented by agreements expiring during 2012.  Note 20  Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs. ##TABLE_START    December 31, 2011   December 31, 2010     Total   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Total   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3  Assets         Money market funds  $ 3,104   $ 3,104     $ 3,337   $ 3,337    Available-for-sale investments   10    5    $ 5    15    10    $ 5  Derivatives   155       $ 155        227       $ 227      Total assets  $ 3,269   $ 3,109   $ 155   $ 5   $ 3,579   $ 3,347   $ 227   $ 5   Liabilities         Derivatives  $ (131 )      $ (131 )      $ (115 )      $ (115 )     Total liabilities  $ (131 )   $ (131 )   $ (115 )   $ (115 )   ##TABLE_END Money market funds and available-for-sale equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Available-for-sale debt investments are primarily valued using an income approach based on benchmark yields, reported trades and broker/dealer quotes. Derivatives include foreign currency, commodity and interest rate contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve. Certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following table presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended December 31, and the carrying value and asset classification of the related assets as of December 31: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010     Carrying Value   Total Losses   Carrying Value   Total Losses  Operating lease equipment  $ 72   $ (64 )  $ 247   $ (143 ) Property, plant and equipment   3    (35 )    (4 ) Other assets, Acquired intangible assets, Cost investment   20    (11 )         Total  $ 95   $ (110 )  $ 247   $ (147 )  ##TABLE_END The operating lease equipment was valued using a market approach based on the fair value of the related aircraft. Property, plant and equipment, Other assets, and Acquired intangible assets were valued using an income approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. The cost investment was valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices for related investments.  Fair Value Disclosures The fair values and related carrying values of financial instruments that are not required to be remeasured at fair value on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    2011   2010     Carrying Amount   Fair Value   Carrying Amount   Fair Value  Assets     Accounts receivable, net  $ 5,793   $ 5,690   $ 5,422   $ 5,283  Notes receivable, net   792    836    480    501  Liabilities     Debt, excluding capital lease obligations   (12,136 )   (14,099 )   (12,234 )   (13,525 ) Accounts payable   (8,406 )   (8,396 )   (7,715 )   (7,704 ) Residual value and credit guarantees   (8 )   (9 )   (12 )   (11 ) Contingent repurchase commitments   (7 )   (4 )   (7 )   (84 )  ##TABLE_END The fair values of the Accounts receivable and Accounts payable are based on current market rates for loans of the same risk and maturities. The fair values of our variable rate notes receivable that reprice frequently approximate their carrying amounts. The fair values of fixed rate notes receivable are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt is based on current market yields for our debt traded in the secondary market. The fair values of the residual value guarantees and contingent repurchase commitments are determined using a Black Futures Options formula and include such assumptions as the expected value of the aircraft on the settlement date, volatility of aircraft prices, time until settlement and the risk free discount rate. The fair value of the credit guarantees is estimated based on the expected cash flows of those commitments, given the creditors probability of default, and discounted using the risk free rate. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain. Items not included in the above disclosures include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper and long-term payables. The carrying values of those items, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Note 21  Legal Proceedings Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts and other matters are pending against us. Potentially material contingencies are discussed below. We are subject to various U.S. government investigations, from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such government disputes and investigations will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, except as set forth below. Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we have disclosed either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.  A-12 Litigation In 1991, the Department of the Navy (the Navy) notified McDonnell Douglas Corporation (now merged into The Boeing Company) and General Dynamics Corporation (together, the Team) that it was terminating for default the Teams contract for development and initial production of the A-12 aircraft. The Team had full responsibility for performance of the contract and both contractors are jointly and severally liable for any potential liabilities resulting from the termination. The Team filed a legal action to contest the Navys default termination, to assert its rights to convert the termination to one for the convenience of the government, and to obtain payment for work done and costs incurred on the A-12 contract but not paid to date. As of December 31, 2011, inventories included approximately $586 of recorded costs on the A-12 contract, against which we have established a loss provision of $350. The amount of the provision, which was established in 1990, was based on McDonnell Douglas Corporations belief, supported by an opinion of outside counsel, that the termination for default would be converted to a termination for convenience, and that the best estimate of possible loss on termination for convenience was $350. On August 31, 2001, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a decision after trial upholding the governments default termination of the A-12 contract. In 2003, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, finding that the trial court had applied the wrong legal standard, vacated the trial courts 2001 decision and ordered the case sent back to the trial court for further proceedings. On May 3, 2007, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a decision upholding the governments default termination of the A-12 contract. We filed a Notice of Appeal on May 4, 2007 with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On June 2, 2009, the Court of Appeals rendered an opinion affirming the trial courts 2007 decision sustaining the governments default termination. On May 23, 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Court of Appeals upholding the default termination, and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals. On July 7, 2011, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the trial court for additional factual determinations. On December 29, 2009, the Navy sent letters to the Team requesting payment of $1,352 in unliquidated progress payments, plus applicable interest. On November 15, 2011, the Navy sent a letter confirming that it would not pursue payment from the Team pending all trial court and appellate proceedings adjudicating the issues remanded by the Supreme Court. We believe that the termination for default is contrary to law and fact and that the loss provision established by McDonnell Douglas Corporation in 1990, which was supported by an opinion from outside counsel, continues to provide adequately for the reasonably possible reduction in value of A-12 net contracts in process as of December 31, 2011. Final resolution of the A-12 litigation will depend on the outcome of further proceedings or possible negotiations with the U.S. government. If after all legal proceedings are concluded, the court determines, contrary to our belief, that a termination for default was appropriate, we could incur an additional loss of up to $275, consisting principally of $236 of remaining inventory costs. If the courts further hold that a money judgment should be entered against the Team, we could be required to pay the U.S. government up to one-half of the unliquidated progress payments of $1,350 plus statutory interest from February 1991 (currently totaling up to $1,565). In that event, our loss would total approximately $1,728 in pre-tax charges. Should, however, the March 31, 1998 judgment of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in favor of the Team be reinstated, we could be entitled to receive payment of approximately $1,177, including interest from June 26, 1991. Employment, Labor and Benefits Litigation We have been named as a defendant in two pending class action lawsuits filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, each related to the 2005 sale of our former Wichita facility to Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. (Spirit). The first action involves allegations that Spirits hiring decisions following the sale were tainted by age discrimination, violated ERISA, violated our collective bargaining  agreements, and constituted retaliation. The case was brought in 2006 as a class action on behalf of individuals not hired by Spirit. During the second quarter of 2010, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Boeing and Spirit on all class action claims. Following certain procedural motions, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals on August 10, 2011, and are seeking to stay all remaining individual claims in the district court pending resolution of the appeal. Plaintiffs appellate brief was filed on November 14, 2011. Boeings appellate brief was filed on January 20, 2012. The second action, initiated in 2007, alleges collective bargaining agreement breaches and ERISA violations in connection with alleged failures to provide benefits to certain former employees of the Wichita facility. Written discovery closed by joint stipulation of the parties on June 6, 2011. Depositions concluded on August 18, 2011. Plaintiffs partial motion for summary judgment was filed on December 9, 2011. Boeings opposition and dispositive motions are due on February 10, 2012. Spirit has agreed to indemnify Boeing for any and all losses in the first action, with the exception of claims arising from employment actions prior to January 1, 2005. While Spirit has acknowledged a limited indemnification obligation in the second action, we believe that Spirit is obligated to indemnify Boeing for any and all losses in the second action. On October 13, 2006, we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. Plaintiffs, seeking to represent a class of similarly situated participants and beneficiaries in The Boeing Company Voluntary Investment Plan (the VIP), alleged that fees and expenses incurred by the VIP were and are unreasonable and excessive, not incurred solely for the benefit of the VIP and its participants, and were undisclosed to participants. The plaintiffs further alleged that defendants breached their fiduciary duties in violation of 502(a)(2) of ERISA, and sought injunctive and equitable relief pursuant to 502(a)(3) of ERISA. During the first quarter of 2010, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted a stay of trial proceedings in the district court pending resolution of an appeal made by Boeing in 2008 to the cases class certification order. On January 21, 2011, the Seventh Circuit reversed the district courts class certification order and decertified the class. The Seventh Circuit remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. On March 2, 2011, plaintiffs filed an amended motion for class certification and a supplemental motion on August 7, 2011. Boeings opposition to class certification was filed on September 6, 2011. Plaintiffs reply brief in support of class certification was filed on September 27, 2011. This issue is fully briefed and awaits district court determination. Boeings motions for summary judgment based on ERISAs statute of repose and for summary judgment on the merits were both filed on December 21, 2011. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter given the current procedural status of the litigation. BSSI/ICO Litigation On August 16, 2004, our wholly owned subsidiary, Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. (BSSI) filed a complaint for declaratory relief against ICO Global Communications (Operations), Ltd. (ICO) in Los Angeles County Superior Court seeking a declaration that ICOs prior termination of two contracts for convenience extinguished all claims between the parties. On September 16, 2004, ICO filed a cross-complaint alleging breach of contract, economic duress, fraud, unfair competition, and other claims. ICO added The Boeing Company as a defendant in October 2005 to some of these claims and for interference with contract and misappropriation of trade secrets. On January 13, 2006, BSSI filed a cross-complaint against ICO, ICO Global Communications (Holdings) Limited (ICO Holdings), ICOs parent, and Eagle River Investments, LLC, parent of both ICO and ICO Holdings, alleging fraud and other claims. The trial commenced on June 19, 2008, with ICO seeking to recover approximately $2,000 in damages, including all monies paid to BSSI and Boeing Launch Services, plus punitive damages and other unspecified damages and relief.  On October 21, 2008, the jury returned a verdict awarding ICO compensatory damages of $371 plus interest, based upon findings of contract breach, fraud and interference with contract. On October 31, 2008, the jury awarded ICO punitive damages of $236. On January 2, 2009, the court entered judgment for ICO in the amount of $631 which included $24 in prejudgment interest. On February 26, 2009 the trial court granted in part and denied in part post-trial motions we filed seeking to set aside the verdict. As a result, on March 3, 2009, the court entered an amended judgment for ICO in the amount of $604, which included $371 in compensatory damages, $207 in punitive damages and $26 in prejudgment interest. Post-judgment interest will accrue on the judgment at the rate of 10% per year (simple interest) from January 2, 2009. As of December 31, 2011, the amount of post-judgment interest totaled $181. We filed a notice of appeal and ICO filed a notice of cross-appeal in March 2009. We believe that we have substantial arguments on appeal, which we are pursuing vigorously. Oral argument took place on January 25, 2012, and a decision could be issued during the first quarter of 2012. Following this decision, either of the parties may seek discretionary review in the California Supreme Court. BSSI/Telesat Canada On November 9, 2006, Telesat Canada (Telesat) and a group of its insurers served BSSI with an arbitration demand alleging breach of contract, gross negligence and willful misconduct in connection with the constructive total loss of Anik F1, a model 702 satellite manufactured by BSSI. Telesat and its insurers initially sought over $385 in damages and $10 in lost profits, but revised their total demand to $263. BSSI has asserted a counterclaim against Telesat for $13.1 in unpaid performance incentive payments plus late charges. BSSI also asserted a $180 contingent counterclaim on the theory that any ultimate award to reimburse the insurers for their payments to Telesat could only result from Telesats breach of its contractual obligation to obtain a full waiver of subrogation rights barring recourse against BSSI. We believe that the claims asserted by Telesat and its insurers lack merit, but we have notified our insurance carriers of the demand. The arbitration was stayed pending an application by Telesat to the Ontario Superior Court on a preliminary issue. On July 16, 2010, the court denied Telesats request to exclude certain evidence, but granted its alternative request to remove the Chairperson from the arbitration panel. A new Chairperson was appointed on August 19, 2010, and the stay has been lifted. The arbitration hearing is currently scheduled for November 12, 2012. On April 26, 2007, a group of our insurers filed a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois asserting certain defenses to coverage and requesting a declaration of their obligation under our insurance and reinsurance policies relating to the Telesat Anik F1 arbitration. On June 12, 2008, the court granted the insurers motion for summary judgment, concluding that our insurance policy excluded the kinds of losses alleged by Telesat. On January 16, 2009, the court granted Boeings motion for reconsideration, ruling in favor of Boeing to require the insurers to provide insurance coverage to defend the claim. The case has been stayed pending completion of the underlying arbitration. Civil Securities Litigation On November 13, 2009, plaintiff shareholders filed a putative securities fraud class action against The Boeing Company and two of our senior executives in federal district court in Chicago. This lawsuit arose from our June 2009 announcement that the first flight of the 787 Dreamliner would be postponed due to a need to reinforce an area within the side-of-body section of the aircraft. Plaintiffs contended that we were aware before June 2009 that the first flight could not take place as scheduled due to issues with the side-of-body section of the aircraft, and that our determination not to announce this  delay earlier resulted in an artificial inflation of our stock price for a multi-week period in May and June 2009. On March 7, 2011, the Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice. On April 4, 2011, plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration. In addition, plaintiff shareholders have filed three similar shareholder derivative lawsuits concerning the flight schedule for the 787 Dreamliner that closely track the allegations in the putative class action lawsuit. Two of the suits were filed in Illinois state court and have been consolidated. The remaining derivative suit was filed in federal district court in Chicago. No briefing or discovery has yet taken place in any of these lawsuits. We believe the allegations in all of these cases are without merit, and we intend to contest the cases vigorously. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter given the current procedural status of the litigation.

For segment reporting purposes, we record Commercial Airplanes segment revenues and cost of sales for airplanes transferred to other segments. Such transfers may include airplanes accounted for as operating leases and considered transferred to the BCC segment and airplanes transferred to the BDS segment for further modification prior to delivery to the customer. The revenues and cost of sales for these transfers are eliminated in the Unallocated items and eliminations caption. For segment reporting purposes, we record BDS revenues and cost of sales for the modification performed on airplanes received from Commercial Airplanes when the airplane is delivered to the customer or at the attainment of performance milestones. Intersegment revenues, eliminated in Unallocated items and eliminations, are shown in the following table. ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Commercial Airplanes  $ 701   $ 604   $ 740  Boeing Capital Corporation   66    92    80  Total  $ 767   $ 696   $ 820   ##TABLE_END  Unallocated Items and Eliminations Unallocated items and eliminations includes costs not attributable to business segments as well as intercompany profit eliminations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Boeing Company Chicago, Illinois We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2. The financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 9, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. / S / D ELOITTE  T OUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois February 9, 2012  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Boeing Company Chicago, Illinois We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011 of the Company and our report dated February 9, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule. / S / D ELOITTE  T OUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois February 9, 2012  ", "9A": " Item 9A.

Financial and Other Business Information See the Summary of Business Segment Data and Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information, including revenues and earnings from operations, for each of our business segments. Intellectual Property We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. Non-U.S. Revenues See Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding non-U.S. revenues. Research and Development Research and development expenditures involve experimentation, design, development and related test activities for defense systems, new and derivative jet aircraft including both commercial and military, advanced space and other company-sponsored product development. These are expensed as incurred including amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on U.S. government contracts. Our total research and development expense amounted to $3.3 billion , $3.9 billion and $4.1 billion in 2012, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Research and development costs also include bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services, as well as costs incurred in excess of amounts estimated to be recoverable under cost-sharing research and development agreements. Bid and proposal costs were $326 million , $332 million and $355 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Employees Total workforce level at December 31, 2012 was approximately 174,400 . As of December 31, 2012 , our principal collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions: ##TABLE_START Union Percent of our Employees Represented Status of the Agreements with the Union The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) 21% We have two major agreements; one expiring in January of 2015 and one in September of 2016. The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) 13% We have one major agreement which expired in October of 2012 that is currently being renegotiated. The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) 2% We have two major agreements; one expiring in October of 2014 and one in February of 2015. ##TABLE_ENDCompetition The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as Airbus, Embraer and Bombardier, and other entrants from Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with greater value products, services, and support. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which span the life cycle of the airplane: aircraft acquisition, readying for service, maintenance and engineering, enhancing and upgrading, and transitioning to the next model - as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. BDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company and General Dynamics Corporation. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), the parent of Airbus, continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In addition, certain of our competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2013 with many international firms attempting to increase their U.S. presence. Regulatory Matters Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our international markets. Government Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default, based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and can require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default. Commercial Aircraft. In the United States, our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Internationally, similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Joint Aviation Authorities. Environmental. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations. A Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site for which we were originally assigned a partial share, the statutory framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. International. Our international sales are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, investment, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. International sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks. Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take one year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of companies. Suppliers We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and program/contract profitability, thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. We are also dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices. Seasonality No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report. Our Commercial Airplanes business depends heavily on commercial airlines, and is subject to unique risks. Market conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft. The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally, or in the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period. We enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. In order to account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by an indexed price escalation formula. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers. Our Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards. The commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers, highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft derivatives, such as the 787-9 and 737 MAX, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy regulatory and customer requirements, and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. We must meet planned production rate targets in order to satisfy customer demand and maintain our profitability. We continue to increase production rates for the 737, 777 and 787 programs, while at the same time engaging in significant ongoing development of the 787-9 and 737 MAX derivative aircraft. If production rate ramp-up efforts at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the rates necessary to achieve our planned rate increases, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer. Operational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins. Our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory certifications, could result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support costs. Further, if we cannot efficiently and cost-effectively incorporate design changes into already-completed 787 and 747-8 production aircraft, we may face further profitability pressures on these programs. If our commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly and technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues. Changes in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the U.S. DoD . Levels of U.S. defense spending in future periods are very difficult to predict and subject to significant risks. In addition, significant budgetary constraints may result in further reductions to projected spending levels. In particular, U.S. government expenditures are subject to the potential for automatic reductions, generally referred to as sequestration. Sequestration may occur during 2013, resulting in significant additional reductions to spending by the U.S. DoD on both existing and new contracts as well as disruption of ongoing programs. We expect that sequestration would have similar impacts on other U.S government customers, such as NASA and various intelligence agencies. Even if sequestration does not occur, we expect that budgetary constraints and ongoing concerns regarding the U.S. national debt will continue to place downward pressure on U.S. DoD spending levels. Due to these and other factors, overall U.S. government defense spending could decline, which could result in significant reductions to revenue, cash flow, profit and backlog primarily in our BDS business. In addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both U.S. defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment, we expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. If we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition priorities and/or fail to meet affordability targets set by the U.S. DoD customer, our revenues and market share would be further impacted. We conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks. In 2012 , 33% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign military sales through the U.S. government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks. Our sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs. New procurement regulations, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our compliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS business. For example, in 2012 the U.S. DoD issued a final rule implementing regulations that increased levels of U.S. government oversight with respect to several key business systems of U.S. government prime contractors. These requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could be subject to additional costs in the form of withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply with these requirements in the future. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. For example, in 2011, the U.S. Army terminated for convenience the entire BCTM program. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as continuing resolutions rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position. We are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S. government contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, routinely audit government contractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false. We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns. Our BDS business generated approximately 70% of its 2012 revenues from fixed-price contracts. While firm fixed price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance. Fixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include AEWC , FAB-T , India P-8I, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, and commercial and military satellites. We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks. Our BDS business generated approximately 30% of its 2012 revenues from cost-type contracting arrangements. Some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Programs whose contracts are primarily cost-type include GMD , Proprietary and SLS programs. We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks. Contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit payments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite does not perform to specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance. The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees we ultimately expect to realize is recognized as revenue in the construction period. If the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criteria, customers will not be obligated to continue making in-orbit payments and/or we may be required to provide refunds to the customer and incur significant charges. Our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components. We rely on other companies including subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies, and production commodities and to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers or incur additional costs. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum, titanium or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the suppliers control or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs. We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results. Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. With respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling and other non-recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, escalation, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact these estimates. Any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under Managements Discussion and Analysis  Critical Accounting Policies  Contract Accounting/Program Accounting on pages 42  44 and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 55  65 of this Form 10-K. Competition within our markets may reduce our future contracts and sales. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasing competition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers and service providers in one or more of our market segments. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation and new priorities, including long-term cost competitiveness, of our U.S. DoD customer will intensify competition for many of our products and services. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not result in reduced revenues and market share. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries. In 2012 , non-U.S. customers accounted for approximately 54% of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including: ##TABLE_START  changes in regulatory requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  domestic and international government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  fluctuations in international currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  volatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the U.S. Export-Import Bank; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  imposition of taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  economic and geopolitical developments and conditions. ##TABLE_END While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future. The outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. We are involved in a number of litigation matters. These claims may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S government, the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our ownership of certain property. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material impact on our financial position and operating results. A significant portion of our and Boeing Capitals customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers based in the United States, and in certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks. A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions, particularly in the United States. Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 aircraft. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position could be materially adversely affected. We may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , our airplane financing commitments totaled $18,083 million and $15,866 million . If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures. As part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful. We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures. We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. While we maintain insurance for certain risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. government, insurance cannot be obtained to protect against all risks and liabilities. It is therefore possible that the amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft technologies, missile systems, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurance coverage we are able to maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims or liabilities. Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses. Our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. Any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of our data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse affect the reputation of Boeing and of our products and services. Some of our and our suppliers workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages. Approximately 68,000 employees, which constitute 39% of our total workforce, are union represented as of December 31, 2012 . We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BMA program production and we may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 12 U.S. labor organizations and 6 non-U.S. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions requirements without impacting our financial condition. The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations. We have substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders ' equity and cash flows from operations and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods. We have qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover the majority of our employees. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and discretionary contributions to improve the plans ' funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions  could have a significant effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to Shareholders ' equity. For U.S. government contracts, we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. We also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the level of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see  Management ' s Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Plans  on page 46 of this Form 10-K. Although GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or past manufacturing operations or the operations of companies we have acquired. In other cases, we may become subject to such costs due to an indemnification agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental liabilities. In addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation requirements could result in additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Unauthorized access to our or our customers information and systems could negatively impact our business. We face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems in order to address these threats. While these measures are designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems, certain types of attacks could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information technology systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we cannot prevent the unauthorized access, release and/or corruption of our customers confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or we could face financial losses.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in many countries and rely on an extensive network of international partners, key suppliers and subcontractors. Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses  Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space  Security (BDS)  supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands and we price our products and services to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. Commercial Airplanes is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security and space to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets often offset. BCC delivers value by supporting our business units and managing overall financing exposure.

Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $12,956 million primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries across all programs. BDS revenues increased by $631 million due to higher revenues in the Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA) and Global Service   Support (GSS) segments partially offset by lower revenues in the Network   Space Systems (NSS) segment. Unallocated items and eliminations reduced revenues by $610 million in 2012 compared with $82 million in 2011 reflecting higher intercompany deliveries of P-8 and commercial aircraft in 2012. Revenues in 2011 increased by $4,429 million or 7% compared with 2010. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $4,337 million due to higher new airplane deliveries, including the impact of entry into service of the 787-8 and 747-8 Freighter, favorable new airplane delivery mix and higher commercial aviation services revenues. BDS revenues increased by $33 million primarily due to higher revenues in the BMA and GSS segments, partially offset by lower revenues in the NSS segment.

Commercial Airplanes earnings increased by $1,216 million reflecting higher new airplane deliveries and lower research and development expense partially offset by higher fleet support costs, increased operating costs associated with business growth, other period costs and decreased earnings from commercial aviation services. BDS earnings decreased by $90 million due to lower earnings in the NSS segment, partially offset by higher earnings in the GSS and BMA segments. Other segment losses increased by $225 million primarily due to a reduction in the allowance for losses on receivables in 2011. Unallocated items and eliminations in 2012 reduced earnings by $403 million compared with 2011 primarily due to higher pension costs. Operating earnings in 2011 increased by $873 million compared with 2010. Commercial Airplanes earnings increased by $489 million, primarily due to higher revenues and a reduction in research and development costs, partially offset by increases in period costs associated with business growth. BDS earnings increased by $283 million compared with 2010 due to higher earnings in the BMA and GSS segments, partially offset by lower earnings in the NSS segment. Other segment earnings increased by $393 million primarily due to a $241 million reduction in the allowance for losses on receivables during 2011. Unallocated items and eliminations in 2011 reduced earnings by $253 million compared with 2010 primarily due to higher pension and postretirement costs. The following table summarizes our research and development expense: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Commercial Airplanes $2,049  $2,715  $2,975 Defense, Space  Security 1,189  1,138  1,136 Other   Total $3,298  $3,918  $4,121 ##TABLE_ENDOur Research and development expense decreased by $620 million and $203 million in 2012 and 2011 . These decreases were primarily due to lower spending at BCA on the 747-8 and 787-8 programs. The most significant items included in Unallocated items and eliminations are shown in the following table: (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Share-based plans ($81 )  ($83 )  ($136 ) Deferred compensation (75 )  (61 )  (112 ) Pension (787 )  (269 )  Postretirement (112 )  (248 )  (59 ) Eliminations and other (336 )  (327 )  (482 ) Total ($1,391 )  ($988 )  ($735 ) ##TABLE_ENDShare-based plans expense decreased by $53 million in 2011 primarily due to the expiration of the ShareValue trust at June 30, 2010. Deferred compensation expense increased by $14 million in 2012 and decreased by $51 million in 2011. The year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price and broad stock market conditions. Eliminations and other unallocated items expense increased by $9 million in 2012 and decreased by $155 million in 2011 . The fluctuations in 2012 and 2011 were due to the timing of intercompany expense allocations and elimination of profit on intercompany items. The 2012 expense includes a $121 million benefit related to a favorable court judgment on satellite litigation and the 2010 expense includes a $55 million charitable contribution. Unallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for U.S. government contracting purposes. We recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of $3,383 million , $3,127 million and $1,864 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The increase in net periodic benefit costs related to pensions and other postretirement benefits is primarily due to higher amortization of actuarial losses and higher service costs driven by lower discount rates. Not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period. A portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense. The unallocated expense in 2011 includes $161 million of additional expense recorded during the third quarter due to an adjustment primarily related to prior years accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. See the discussion of the postretirement liabilities in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Earnings from operations included the following amounts allocated to business segments and Other unallocated items and eliminations. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits Years ended December 31,      Allocated to business segments ($1,620 )  ($1,379 )  ($1,155 )  ($431 )  ($444 )  ($421 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations (787 )  (269 )   (112 )  (248 )  (59 ) Total ($2,407 )  ($1,648 )  ($1,101 )  ($543 )  ($692 )  ($480 ) ##TABLE_ENDOther Earnings Items (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Earnings from operations $6,311  $5,844  $4,971 Other income, net   Interest and debt expense (463 )  (498 )  (516 ) Earnings before income taxes 5,910  5,393  4,507 Income tax expense (2,007 )  (1,382 )  (1,196 ) Net earnings from continuing operations $3,903  $4,011  $3,311 ##TABLE_ENDInterest and debt expense decreased by $35 million in 2012 and $18 million in 2011 as a result of lower weighted average interest rates and debt balances. Our effective income tax rates were 34.0% , 25.6% and 26.5% for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Our 2012 effective tax rate was higher than prior years, primarily due to tax benefits of $397 million and $371 million recorded in 2011 and 2010 as a result of federal income tax audit settlements. Federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2007. The absence of research and development tax credits also contributed to the higher tax rate in 2012. Our 2011 effective tax rate was lower than 2010, primarily due to an income tax charge of $150 million recorded during the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. The research and development credit expired on December 31, 2011. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 that retroactively renews the research and development credit for 2012 and extends the credit through December 31, 2013. As tax law changes are recognized in the period in which new legislation is enacted, the 2012 RD credit of approximately $150 million will be reflected as a discrete item in our income tax rate for the first quarter of 2013. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog Our backlog at December 31 was as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)   Contractual Backlog:      Commercial Airplanes $317,287  $293,303  $255,591 Defense, Space  Security:      Boeing Military Aircraft 29,674  24,085  25,094 Network and Space Systems 9,692  9,024  9,567 Global Services and Support 15,702  13,245  13,703 Total Defense, Space  Security 55,068  46,354  48,364 Total contractual backlog $372,355  $339,657  $303,955 Unobligated backlog $17,873  $15,775  $16,871 ##TABLE_ENDContractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog during 2012 was due to commercial aircraft orders in excess of deliveries, partially reduced by cancellations of commercial airplane orders and changes in projected revenue escalation. The increase in contractual backlog during 2011 was due to commercial airplane orders in excess of deliveries and changes in projected revenue escalation for undelivered commercial airplanes. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The increase in unobligated backlog during 2012 is due to increases at BDS of $2,720 million compared with 2011 primarily due to F-15 orders and the contract award for the Space Launch System program received in 2012. The decrease in unobligated backlog during 2011 is due to decreases at BDS of $3,135 million compared with 2010 primarily due to funding of existing multi-year contracts and termination for convenience by the U.S. Army of the Brigade Combat Team Modernization (BCTM) program, partially offset by the U.S. Air Force (USAF) contract for the KC-46A Tanker and the Missile Defense Agency Development and Sustainment Contract. Additional Considerations KC-46A Tanker In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the USAF to design, develop, manufacture and deliver 4 next generation aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Tanker will be a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. This contract is a fixed-price incentive firm contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs. Changes to our estimated cost to perform the work could result in a material charge. This contract contains production options. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. For segment reporting purposes, backlog, revenues and costs are recorded in the Commercial Airplanes and BMA segments. Collective Bargaining Agreement Our collective bargaining agreement with The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), which covers 23,600 employees, expired in October, 2012. SPEEA-represented employees continue to work under the terms of that contract. The parties continue contract negotiations and on January 17, 2013, Boeing presented a contract offer to SPEEA. Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment Global economic growth and global trade, which are the primary drivers of air travel and air cargo growth, remained weak in 2012. Despite this, passenger traffic grew by approximately 6% in 2011 and 2012 and is forecast to continue at or near the long-term trend of 5% in 2013. There continues to be significant variation between regions and airline business models, with airlines operating in emerging economies and low-cost-carriers leading growth. Estimates indicate a modest decline in air cargo traffic in 2012 with continued softness in 2013. The relative weakness of the air cargo market has impacted near-term demand for new freighter aircraft and freighter conversions, and we continue to monitor the impact of this trend on our business. Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also relentlessly focusing on reducing costs by renewing fleets to leverage more fuel efficient airplanes and by employing efficiency generating service offerings in a high-fuel-price environment. Net profits for the global airline industry are estimated to total $7 billion in 2012 and the forecast shows some improvement in 2013. These profit levels reflect low profit margins for the industry, and risk remains due to ongoing economic and political uncertainty. The long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast is for a long-term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger and cargo traffic, based on a projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long-term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $4.5 trillion market for 34,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, and increased global environmental regulations. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia has enabled low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines have increased the pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 15% of Commercial Airplanes contractual backlog, in dollar terms, is with U.S. airlines, including cargo carriers. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft in the market above 90 seats. Many of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including launch aid, which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airplane development activities and enables airplanes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. Changes in value of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies impact competitors revenues and profits. Competitors routinely respond to a relatively weaker U.S. dollar by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer-term competitive posture. If the U.S. dollar strengthens, competitors can use the improved efficiency to fund product development, gain market share through pricing and/or improve earnings. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively.

Revenues for 2011 increased by $4,337 million or 13.6% compared with 2010 due to higher new airplane deliveries, including the impact of entry into service of the 787-8 and 747-8 Freighter, favorable commercial airplane delivery model mix and higher commercial aviation services revenues. The increase in revenues from commercial aviation services was primarily due to increased sales of spares. Commercial airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START       Total            Cumulative deliveries 4,293  1,458  1,040  1,066    Deliveries (1)     (2)  2011            Cumulative deliveries 3,878  1,427  1,014     Deliveries (1)      2010            Cumulative deliveries 3,506  1,418      Deliveries (1)      ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Includes intercompany deliveries of nine aircraft in 2012, seven in 2011 and five in 2010. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Includes three aircraft accounted for as revenues by BCA and as operating leases in consolidation. ##TABLE_END Earnings From Operations Earnings from operations for 2012  increased by $1,216 million compared with 2011 . This was primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries, which drove an increase in earnings of $1,292 million, and lower research and development expense of $666 million primarily due to lower spending on the 747-8 and 787-8 programs. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings of $742 million driven by higher fleet support costs, increased operating costs associated with business growth, other period costs and decreased earnings from commercial aviation services. The decrease in operating margins from 9.7% in 2011 to 9.6% in 2012 was primarily due to the dilutive effect of the 787 and 747-8 deliveries. Earnings from operations for 2011 increased by $489 million compared with 2010. This increase reflects earnings of $376 million from higher revenues on new airplane deliveries, $180 million of higher earnings due to commercial aviation services volume and margins and $261 million of lower research and development expense, partially offset by increases of $328 million reflecting higher fleet support costs and other costs associated with business growth. Backlog Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their Board of Directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers. The increase in contractual backlog during 2012 was due to orders in excess of deliveries, partially reduced by cancellations of orders and changes in projected revenue escalation. The decrease in unobligated backlog in 2012 was due to incremental funding of the existing multi-year contract for Commercial Airplanes share of the USAF contract for the KC-46A Tanker. The increase in contractual backlog during 2011 was due to orders in excess of deliveries and changes in projected revenue escalation, partially reduced by cancellations of orders. The increase in unobligated backlog in 2011 represents Commercial Airplanes share of the USAF contract for the KC-46A Tanker. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a programs life. Estimation of each programs accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. ##TABLE_START Program     2012          Program accounting quantities 6,600  1,574  1,103  1,450  1,100 Undelivered units under firm orders 3,074     Cumulative firm orders 7,367  1,525  1,108  1,431  2011          Program accounting quantities 6,200  1,549  1,084  1,350  1,100 Undelivered units under firm orders 2,365     Cumulative firm orders 6,243  1,524  1,086  1,363  2010          Program accounting quantities 5,000  1,524  1,048  1,150  * Undelivered units under firm orders 2,186     Cumulative firm orders 5,692  1,525  1,044  1,163  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * The initial accounting quantity for the 787 program was established in the third quarter of 2011. ##TABLE_END737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 400 units during 2012 due to the program  s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. As planned, production increased from 31.5 to 35 airplanes per month during 2012. We continue to expect to increase production from 35 to 38 airplanes per month beginning in 2013 and a further increase to 42 airplanes per month beginning in 2014. The majority of the 737 orders during 2012 related to the 737 MAX, the new engine variant of the 737. The accounting quantity for the 737 program includes NG and MAX units. First delivery of the 737 MAX is expected in 2017. 747 Program The accounting quantity for the 747 program increased by 25 units in 2012, reflecting the normal process of estimating planned production under existing and anticipated contracts. We continue to incorporate changes identified during flight testing into previously completed airplanes. First delivery of the 747-8 Intercontinental occurred in February 2012. The production rate increased from 1.5 to 2 airplanes per month in May 2012. Ongoing weakness in the air cargo market and lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger aircraft have resulted in pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated in 2012. We have a number of unsold Freighter and Intercontinental production positions beyond 2013. If we are unable to obtain orders for multiple Freighter aircraft in 2013 consistent with our near-term production plans, we may be required to take actions including reducing the number of airplanes produced and/or building airplanes for which we have not received firm orders. We also remain focused on reducing out-of-sequence work, improving supply chain efficiency and implementing cost-reduction efforts. If market and production risks cannot be mitigated, the program could face an additional reach-forward loss that may be material. 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 19 units during 2012 reflecting the normal process of estimating planned production under existing and anticipated contracts. As we reconfigure the 767 assembly line to include the USAF KC-46A Tanker, we plan to decrease our production rate from 2 to 1 airplanes per month in late 2013. We then expect to increase the rate to 1.5 per month in 2014 and back to 2 per month in 2016. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 100 units during 2012 due to the program  s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. As previously announced, we plan to increase our production rate from 7 per month to 8.3 per month in 2013. 787 Program We delivered 46 787 aircraft in 2012 bringing cumulative deliveries to 49. We continued to incorporate engineering and other design changes identified during flight testing into already completed aircraft. Beginning in June 2012, airplanes coming out of final assembly have not required change incorporation at our Everett modification center. During the second quarter of 2012 we achieved a production rate of 3.5 per month in final assembly and in the fourth quarter of 2012, we achieved a program production rate of 5 airplanes per month in final assembly. We also activated the temporary surge line in Everett in the third quarter. We remain focused on achieving further planned increases in 787 production rates while continuing to satisfy customer mission and performance requirements. We also continue to monitor and address challenges associated with aircraft production and assembly, including management of our manufacturing operations and extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work, as well as introduction of the 787-9 derivative into the manufacturing process. We continue to expect to increase the production rate of 787 aircraft to 10 per month in final assembly by the end of 2013 with first deliveries occurring at that rate in early 2014. Our efforts to achieve planned production rate targets include improving the production system, coordinating rate increases with suppliers and increasing production rates in both Everett and North Charleston final assembly. We continue to expect first delivery of the 787-9 to occur in early 2014. In addition, we continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of prior schedule changes, including requests for contractual relief related to delivery delays and supplier assertions. During 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs associated with these airplanes were included in research and development expense. During the fourth quarter of 2012 we finalized an order for one of the three remaining flight test aircraft. We continue to believe that the other two 787 flight-test aircraft are commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to those airplanes in program inventory at December 31, 2012. If we determine that either of the remaining aircraft cannot be sold, we may incur additional charges. The accounting quantity of 1,100 units remains unchanged and represents approximately 10 years of production at planned production rates. The cumulative impacts of production challenges, change incorporation, schedule delays from prior periods and customer and supplier impacts have created significant pressure on program profitability. If risks related to this program, including risks associated with change incorporation, planned production rate increases, or introducing the 787-9 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions, as well as further pressures on program profitability and/or a reach-forward loss. We continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks. A battery-related failure occurred on a 787 aircraft on January 7, 2013. On January 15, 2013 a second 787 aircraft had a battery incident. On January 16, 2013, the Federal Aviation Administration issued an airworthiness directive to address potential battery risk on the 787 and required U.S. aircraft operators to suspend operations of all 787 aircraft. International government regulators also issued directives to the same effect. We are working with the government regulators and 787 aircraft operators to investigate both incidents. While production continues on the 787, we have suspended deliveries until appropriate clearance is granted by the regulatory agencies. We are unable to reasonably estimate a loss or a range of loss at this time because such estimates are dependent on the ultimate finding as to cause and the timing and conditions surrounding a resolution and return to flight. Any such resolution could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. Research and Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. Our Research and development expense decreased by $666 million and $260 million in 2012 and 2011 . These decreases were primarily due to lower spending on the 747-8 and 787-8 programs. Additional Considerations The development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft derivatives, such as the 787-9 and 737 MAX, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors in aircraft purchase contracts, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for derivative airplanes and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Defense, Space  Security Business Environment and Trends U.S. Defense Environment Overview In August 2011, the Budget Control Act reduced the United States Department of Defense ( U.S. DoD ) top line budget by approximately $490 billion through 2021. In addition, U.S. government expenditures are subject to the potential for further reductions, generally referred to as  sequestration  . Sequestration would result in additional reductions of approximately $500 billion from the defense top line budget through 2021. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has estimated that sequestration would reduce non-exempt defense discretionary accounts during U.S. government fiscal year 2013 by approximately 9.4% (excluding military personnel accounts). The OMB has further stated that the budget for Overseas Contingency Operations and any unobligate d balances in prior year funds would be included in aggregate reductions but has otherwise indicated that it cannot yet assess the impact of sequestration at the program, project and activity level. The U.S. DoD has indicated that such reductions might require the termination of certain, as yet undetermined, procurement programs, and other U.S. government customers, such as NASA and various intelligence agencies, may be required to take comparable actions. Any such impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows. With the aforementioned fiscal challenges as a backdrop, the U.S. DoD announced a significant revision to the defense strategy in January 2012. This new strategy prioritized the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions, reduced the number of ground forces, maintained nuclear deterrence and reduced Cold War assets. Additionally, it emphasized the increasing importance of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Cyber Security; Space; Special Operations; and Unmanned Systems in implementing the nation's security posture. We anticipated this shift in U.S. DoD priorities and aligned our strategy accordingly. As such, we have been developing organic and inorganic capabilities to better serve our customers and their emerging needs in these markets, including the acquisition over the last five years of targeted capabilities with expertise in these priority markets. International Environment Overview The international market continues to be driven by rapidly evolving security challenges and the need for countries to modernize aging inventories. Western governments are pressured by new threats to security while at the same time dealing with constrained budgets. In Europe, the continuing financial challenges are forcing governments to institute austerity measures negatively impacting defense spending in the near term. The strongest opportunities for BDS growth in 2013 will be the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions where the relative financial strength of these economies, coupled with a broad spectrum of evolving threats, will result in procurement of defense and security systems. BDS Realignment Effective January 1, 2012, 2011 and 2010 , certain programs were realigned among BDS segments. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Revenues $32,607  $31,976  $31,943 % of total company revenues %  %  % Earnings from operations $3,068  $3,158  $2,875 Operating margins 9.4 %  9.9 %  9.0 % Contractual backlog $55,068  $46,354  $48,364 Unobligated backlog $16,407  $13,687  $16,822 ##TABLE_ENDSince our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues and earnings, may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Revenues BDS revenues increased by $631 million in 2012 compared with 2011 , due to higher revenues of $1,437 million in the BMA segment and $264 million in the GSS segment, partially offset by lower revenues of $1,070 million in the NSS segment. BDS revenues increased by $33 million in 2011 compared with 2010, due to higher revenues in the BMA and the GSS segments, partially offset by lower revenues in the NSS segment. Operating Earnings BDS operating earnings in 2012  decreased by $90 million compared with 2011 due to lower earnings of $201 million in the NSS segment, partially offset by higher earnings of $56 million and $55 million in the GSS and BMA segments. Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $150 million higher in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily reflecting higher favorable adjustments in the BMA segment. BDS operating earnings in 2011 increased by $283 million compared with 2010 primarily due to higher earnings of $276 million and $33 million in the BMA and GSS segments, partially offset by lower earnings of $26 million in the NSS segment. Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments which were $104 million higher in 2011 compared with 2010. Backlog Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. BDS total backlog increased by 19% in 2012 , from $60,041 million to $71,475 million , primarily due to F-15 and C-17 orders and the contract award for the Space Launch System program received in 2012. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional Considerations Our BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense ( GMD ), Proprietary and Space Launch Systems programs. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Airborne Early Warning and Control ( AEWC ), Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals ( FAB-T ), India P-8I, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, and commercial and military satellites. Boeing Military Aircraft Operating Results (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Revenues $16,384  $14,947  $14,238 % of total company revenues %  %  % Earnings from operations $1,581  $1,526  $1,250 Operating margins 9.6 %  10.2 %  8.8 % Contractual backlog $29,674  $24,085  $25,094 Unobligated backlog $9,286  $7,155  $8,297 ##TABLE_ENDRevenues BMA revenues increased by 10% in 2012 compared with 2011. The increase of $1,437 million in 2012 was primarily due to higher deliveries on the P-8A and Apache programs of $1,050 million and higher milestone revenue of $426 million on the KC-46A Tanker program. In addition, F-15 program revenues were $450 million higher reflecting initial revenues on the contract for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia partially offset by lower F-15 deliveries. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $723 million related to fewer deliveries of C-17 aircraft in 2012 and the conclusion of the KC-767 International Tanker program in 2011. BMA revenues increased by 5% in 2011 compared with 2010. The increase of $709 million in 2011 was primarily due to higher AEWC , C-17 and KC-767 International Tanker revenues. AEWC revenues increased by $780 million in 2011 due to delivery of the first two Peace Eye aircraft and higher Wedgetail milestone revenues. C-17 revenues increased by $273 million reflecting favorable mix, partially offset by fewer deliveries. International Tanker revenues increased by $235 million due to higher deliveries. In addition, initial revenues on the USAF KC-46A Tanker were recognized in 2011. Lower volumes on the F-22, F/A-18 and Apache programs combined to reduce revenues by $613 million. Boeing production deliveries on the F-22 program ended in 2011. There were no new-build Apache deliveries in 2011, however, new-build deliveries resumed in 2012. Deliveries of new-build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   F/A-18 Models   F-15E Eagle   C-17 Globemaster III   CH-47 Chinook   AH-64 Apache   AEWC   P-8A Poseidon   KC-767 International Tanker   Total new-build production aircraft   ##TABLE_ENDOperating Earnings BMA operating earnings increased by $55 million in 2012 primarily due to higher aircraft deliveries on the P-8A and Apache programs and reach-forward loss provisions in 2011 on the KC-767 International Tanker program. These increases were partially offset by fewer aircraft deliveries on the C-17 program and higher research and development costs. The increase in earnings includes net favorable cumulative catch-up contract adjustments which were $139 million higher in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily reflecting favorable adjustments on the F-15 and Chinook programs. Operating earnings increased by $276 million in 2011 primarily due to $236 million of higher earnings on the AEWC program reflecting the initial Peace Eye deliveries and lower reach-forward loss provisions in 2011 on the AEWC Wedgetail and Peace Eagle contracts. Lower reach-forward losses of $49 million on the KC-767 International Tanker program and lower research and development costs also contributed to the earnings improvements. Backlog BMA total backlog in 2012  increased by 25% from 2011 , primarily due to F-15 and C-17 orders. Total backlog in 2011 decreased by 6% from 2010, primarily due to 2011 deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years partially offset by BMAs share of the USAF contract awards for the KC-46A and low-rate initial production of the P-8A. Additional Considerations C-17 See the discussion of the C-17 program in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The decrease of $1,070 million in 2012 was primarily due to $835 million of lower revenues on the Brigade Combat Team Modernization ( BCTM ) program, which was terminated for convenience during 2011. In addition, customer funding constraints on the GMD program and conclusion of the Space Shuttle program in 2011 reduced revenues by a total of $251 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher Space  Intelligence Systems revenues of $178 million due to larger volume of deliveries in 2012. The decrease of $795 million in 2011 was primarily due to $577 million of lower revenues on the BCTM program, which was terminated for convenience during 2011. Lower revenues on the GMD , SBInet and Joint Tactical Radio System programs of $150 million, $146 million and $93 million, respectively, were more than offset by $150 million of higher sales of Delta inventory to United Launch Alliance ( ULA ) and $250 million of higher commercial and civil satellite revenues. Delta launch and new-build satellite deliveries were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Delta II    Delta IV    Commercial and civil satellites   Military satellites   ##TABLE_ENDOperating Earnings NSS earnings decreased by $201 million in 2012 primarily due to lower revenues on the BCTM program and a $42 million charge related to a contract restructure of an electronic and mission system program. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $56 million lower in 2012 than in 2011 primarily reflecting the $42 million charge described above. Operating earnings decreased by $26 million in 2011 primarily due to lower revenues and higher research and development costs. NSS operating earnings include equity earnings of $180 million , $194 million and $189 million from the United Space Alliance ( USA ) joint venture and the ULA joint venture in 2012, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Operating earnings in 2012 include a $39 million gain related to the termination and settlement of USA s defined benefit pension plans. Backlog NSS total backlog increased by 8% in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to the contract award for the Space Launch System program, partially offset by current year deliveries and sales on contracts awarded in prior years. Total backlog decreased 14% in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to termination for convenience by the U.S. Army of the BCTM program and revenues recognized on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by the contract award for the Missile Defense Agency Development and Sustainment Contract.

The 2012  increase of $264 million is primarily due to higher volume in several Integrated Logistics (IL) programs, including contracts to support Chinook and C-17 aircraft, and higher Training Systems  Government Services (TSGS) revenues primarily related to the P-8A program. The 2011 increase of $119 million is primarily due to higher revenues on several IL programs, partially offset by lower revenues from Maintenance, Modifications and Upgrades (MMU) due to the conclusion in 2010 of our KC-10 support program. Operating Earnings GSS operating earnings increased by 6% in 2012 primarily due to improved performance on several MMU programs and higher revenues on several IL programs. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $67 million higher in 2012 than in 2011. Operating earnings increased by 4% in 2011 primarily due to higher earnings on several IL programs, partially offset by lower earnings on MMU programs. Backlog GSS total backlog increased by 19% in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to the award of F-15 support contracts. Total backlog decreased by 3% in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to revenues recognized on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years on several IL programs, partially offset by a TSGS contract award on the P-8A program. Boeing Capital Business Environment and Trends BCCs customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2012 totaled $4,066 million . A substantial portion of BCCs portfolio is concentrated among certain U.S. commercial airline customers. BCCs portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types most notably out-of-production Boeing aircraft such as 717 aircraft. BCC provided customer financing of $364 million and $239 million during 2012 and 2011 . While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2013, we expect financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,200 western-built commercial jet aircraft ( 10% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2012 , including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 25% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2011 and 2010 , 9.4% and 10.5% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. Summary Financial Information (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Revenues $441  $520  $639 Earnings from operations $82  $113  $152 Operating margins %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDRevenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease and interest from financing receivables and notes. BCCs revenues decreased  $79 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to lower operating and finance lease income. Operating lease income decreased as a result of the return of aircraft and lower lease rates on re-leased aircraft. In addition, lower finance lease income reflects the revised contractual terms of BCC  s leases with AirTran Airways Inc.(Airtran), a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest Airlines Co. (Southwest), negotiated in conjunction with receiving a full guarantee from Southwest of those lease payment obligations in the fourth quarter of 2011. The decrease in revenues in 2011 compared with 2010 of $119 million was primarily due to lower operating lease income from a smaller portfolio of equipment under operating leases as a result of aircraft returns and lower lease rates on re-leased aircraft and lower interest income on notes receivable resulting from a lower weighted average notes receivable balance and a decrease in the weighted average annual effective interest rate during 2011. Earnings From Operations BCCs operating earnings are presented net of interest expense, recovery of losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Operating earnings decreased by $31 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to lower revenues partially offset by lower interest and asset impairment expense. Operating earnings decreased by $39 million in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to lower revenues and higher asset impairment expense partially offset by lower interest expense, lower depreciation expense and a reduction in the allowance for losses. Financial Position The following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  BCC customer financing and investment portfolio $4,066  $4,315 Valuation allowance as a % of total receivables 2.0 %  2.3 % Debt $2,511  $3,400 Debt-to-equity ratio 5.0-to-1  6.3-to-1 ##TABLE_ENDBCCs customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2012  decreased from December 31, 2011 primarily due to normal portfolio run-off and asset sales, partially offset by the origination of notes receivable. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , BCC had $354 million and $521 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease, of which $266 million and $476 million had either executed term sheets with deposits or firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $78 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2013. These aircraft are being remarketed or the leases are being extended and approximately $33 million of such aircraft had either executed term sheets with deposits or firm contracts as of December 31, 2012 . For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , AirTran accounted for 18% and 21% of BCC revenue. On July 8, 2012, BCC, Boeing, Southwest and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Delta) reached agreement whereby 78 BCC 717 aircraft on lease to AirTran will be subleased from AirTran to Delta on a phased-in basis beginning in 2013, with the sublease scheduled for the duration of the lease term between BCC and AirTran. Delta has committed to lease these 717 aircraft from BCC for an additional seven-year period following the expiration of the sublease. BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in the Other segment, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment. Bankruptcies In 2011, American Airlines, Inc. (American Airlines) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. American Airlines retains certain rights by operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, including the right to reject executory contracts, such as aircraft leases. American Airlines has not rejected any of the leases related to our aircraft. At December 31, 2012 , American Airlines accounted for $524 million of our customer financing portfolio, of which $399 million represents collateral for $231 million of non-recourse debt. We believe that our customer financing receivables from American Airlines are sufficiently collateralized such that we do not expect to incur losses related to those receivables as a result of the bankruptcy. We continue to monitor the American Airlines bankruptcy for potential impacts on our business. Restructurings and Restructuring Requests From time to time, certain customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with BCC. During 2012, BCC did not reach agreement on any restructuring requests that would have a material effect on our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. Other Segment (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Revenues $133  $150  $138 Earnings/(Loss) from operations (159 )   (327 ) ##TABLE_ENDOther segment operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by $225 million compared with 2011 primarily due to a $241 million reduction in the allowance for losses on AirTran receivables in 2011. Lower environmental expense of $82 million in 2012 compared with 2011 was largely offset by higher costs related to BCC guarantees and increases in other costs. Other segment operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $393 million compared with 2010 primarily due to a $241 million reduction in the allowance for losses on AirTran receivables and $124 million of lower impairment charges related to our customer financing portfolio in 2011. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Summary (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Net earnings $3,900  $4,018  $3,307 Non-cash items 2,728  2,140  2,679 Changes in working capital  (2,135 )  (3,034 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 7,508  4,023  2,952 Net cash (used)/provided by investing activities (3,757 )  2,369  (4,831 ) Net cash used by financing activities (3,477 )  (1,700 )  (1,962 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents  (2 )  (15 ) Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents  4,690  (3,856 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 10,049  5,359  9,215 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $10,341  $10,049  $5,359 ##TABLE_ENDOperating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.5 billion during 2012 , an increase of $3.5 billion compared with 2011 primarily due to lower inventory growth in 2012 , which was partially offset by $1.6 billion of contributions to our pension plans in 2012 compared with $0.5 billion in 2011 and $35 million in 2010. Our investment in gross inventories increased by $6.2 billion in 2012, and by $9.8 billion in 2011, driven by higher investments in commercial airplane program inventory, primarily 787 inventory. Advances and progress billings increased to $41.6 billion at December 31, 2012 compared with $39.8 billion at December 31, 2011 and $34.7 billion at December 31, 2010. Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities totaled $3.8 billion during 2012 compared with $2.4 billion provided during 2011 , largely due to higher contributions to investments in time deposits. Net contributions to investments were $2 billion in 2012 compared with net proceeds from investments of $4 billion in 2011. In 2012 , capital expenditures totaled $1.7 billion , consistent with the prior year. We expect capital expenditures to be higher in 2013 due to continued investment to support growth. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $3.5 billion during 2012 , an increase of $1.8 billion compared with 2011 as a result of higher debt repayments of $1.1 billion and lower new borrowings of $0.7 billion. In 2012 , we repaid $2.1 billion of debt, including repayments of $0.9 billion of debt held at BCC. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the recorded balance of debt was $10.4 billion and $12.4 billion , of which $1.4 billion and $2.4 billion were classified as short-term. This includes $2.5 billion and $3.4 billion of debt recorded at BCC, of which $0.6 billion and $0.9 billion were classified as short-term. In 2012 and 2011 , we had 1,007,706 and 350,778 shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholding and did not repurchase any shares through our open market share repurchase program. In December 2012, we announced the resumption of this program with repurchases expected to total between $1.5 and $2 billion in 2013. Capital Resources We have substantial borrowi ng capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that continues to serve as a significant potential source of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2012 and at December 31, 2012 , we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $4.6 billion of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. Financing commitments totaled $18.1 billion and $15.9 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 . We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take adv antage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , our pension plans were $19.7 billion and $16.6 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an ERISA basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2012 with minimal required contributions in 2013 . We expect to make discretionary contributions to our plans of approximately $1.5 billion in 2013 . We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years. As of December 31, 2012 , we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and lea seback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2012 , and the estimated timing thereof. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Total  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  3-5 years  After 5 years Long-term debt (including current portion) $10,251  $1,340  $2,147  $1,095  $5,669 Interest on debt (1) 6,177     4,054 Pension and other postretirement cash requirements 25,558   1,244  7,025  16,710 Capital lease obligations     Operating lease obligations 1,405     Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position 118,002  44,472  41,838  18,956  12,736 Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position 15,981  14,664  1,307   Total contractual obligations $177,558  $61,885  $47,812  $28,039  $39,822 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2012 . Variable rate debt was less than 1% of our total debt at December 31, 2012 . ##TABLE_END Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Approximately 5% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts. Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation. Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2012 , we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2012 , we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $16.2 billion that extend through 2026 . Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Income Tax Obligations As of December 31, 2012 , our net liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions, was $111 million . We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. Our income tax matters are excluded from the table above. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2012 . ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Total Amounts Committed/Maximum Amount of Loss  Less than 1 year 1-3 years  4-5 years  After 5 years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $4,545  $2,791 $1,332  $292  $130 Commercial aircraft financing commitments 18,083  1,341 6,588  6,253  3,901 Total commercial commitments $22,628  $4,132 $7,920  $6,545  $4,031 ##TABLE_ENDCommercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contingent Obligations We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our contesting the default termination of the contract for A-12 aircraft, certain employment, labor and benefits litigation and civil securities litigation relating to disclosures concerning the 787 program. Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $710 million at December 31, 2012 . For additional information, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We have recorded a liability of $1,055 million at December 31, 2012 for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting We use contract accounting to determine revenue, cost of sales, and profit for almost all of our BDS business. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contracts inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ending December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all BDS contracts increased operating earnings by $379 million , $229 million and $125 million , respectively. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS for all of 2012 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $326 million . In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower margins than established programs. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or other circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs for all of 2012 had been estimated to be lower by 1%, it would have increased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $420 million. If the combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs for all of 2012 (excluding the 747 and 787 programs which have gross margins that are breakeven or near breakeven at December 31, 2012) had been estimated to be higher by 1%, it would have decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $324 million . If we are unable to mitigate risks associated with the 747 and 787 programs, or if we are required to change one or more of our pricing, cost or other assumptions related to these programs, we could be required to record reach forward losses which could have a material effect on our reported results. Aircraft Valuation Allowance for Losses on Customer Financing Receivables The allowance for losses on customer financing receivables (valuation provision) is used to provide for potential impairment of customer financing receivables in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the customer financing receivables portfolio. The estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including historical loss experience, collateral values, and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings, collateral values and default rates. If each customers credit rating were upgraded or downgraded by one major rating category at December 31, 2012 , the allowance would have decreased by $35 million or increased by $90 million . If the collateral values were 20% higher or lower at December 31, 2012 , the allowance would have decreased by $21 million or increased by $20 million . If the cumulative default rates used for each rating category increased or decreased 1%, the allowance would have increased or decreased by $6 million . Impairment Review for Assets Under Operating Leases and Held for Re-Lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than its carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Had future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been 10% lower, we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . Residual Values Equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease. Estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease. If the estimated residual values declined 20% at December 31, 2012 , we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , and a future cumulative pre-tax earnings reduction of approximately $82 million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods, of which approximately $16 million would be recognized in 2013 . Our investment in sales-type/finance leases includes future minimum lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of leased assets less unearned income. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other than temporary are recognized in the period in which the decline occurs. If the estimated residual values declined 20% at December 31, 2012 , we estimate that we would have reduced pre-tax income by $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. April 1 is our annual testing date. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any. We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2012 and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. A 10% decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our operations would have no impact on the carrying value of goodwill. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we had $497 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would reduce the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets by less than $1 million . Postretirement Plans The majority of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans. All nonunion and some union employees hired after December 31, 2008 are not covered by defined benefit plans. We also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend rate (rate of growth for medical costs). Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligations and Shareholders equity. The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2012 . ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Change in discount rate Increase 25 bps  Change in discount rate Decrease 25 bps Pension plans    Projected benefit obligation ($2,444 )  $3,112 Net periodic pension cost (250 )  Other postretirement benefit plans    Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (175 )  Net periodic postretirement benefit cost (12 )  ##TABLE_ENDPension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2012 net periodic pension expense by $126 million . We expect 2013 net periodic pension cost to increase by approximately $400 million and the portion recognized in earnings for 2013 to increase by approximately $800 million primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate from 4.4% at December 31, 2011 to 3.8% at December 31, 2012 and amortization of actuarial losses. The assumed medical trend rates have a significant effect on the following years expense, recorded liabilities and Shareholders equity. The following table shows the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 100 basis point change as of December 31, 2012 . ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Change in medical trend rate Increase 100 bps  Change in medical trend rate Decrease 100 bps Other postretirement benefit plans    Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation $827  ($700 ) Net periodic postretirement benefit cost  (110 ) ##TABLE_END", "7A": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2012, the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2012 , a 10% increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized gains by $194 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our unrealized gains by $221 million . Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. ", "8": " Item 8.

The Boeing Company and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010  (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as Boeing, the Company, we, us, or our). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Our financial statements include the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as required by new accounting guidance, which we retrospectively adopted during 2012. Use of Estimates Management makes assumptions and estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Those assumptions and estimates directly affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant estimates for which changes in the near term are considered reasonably possible and that may have a material impact on the financial statements are disclosed in these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Cycle For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year and could exceed three years . Revenue and Related Cost Recognition Contract Accounting Contract accounting is used for development and production activities predominantly by Defense, Space  Security (BDS). The majority of business conducted by BDS is performed under contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that extend over several years. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract resulting in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. When the current estimates of total sales and costs for a contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contracts percent complete. In 2012 , 2011 and 2010 net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments increased operating earnings by $379 , $229 and $125 , respectively and EPS by $0.33 , $0.23 and $0.12 , respectively. We combine contracts for accounting purposes when they are negotiated as a package with an overall profit margin objective. These essentially represent an agreement to do a single project for a single customer, involve interrelated construction activities with substantial common costs, and are performed concurrently or sequentially. When a group of contracts is combined, revenue and profit are earned uniformly over the performance of the combined contracts. Similarly, we may segment a single contract or group of contracts when a clear economic decision has been made during contract negotiations that would produce different rates of profitability for each element or phase of the contract. Sales related to fixed-price contracts are recognized as deliveries are made, except for certain fixed-price contracts that require substantial performance over an extended period before deliveries begin, for which sales are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones. Sales related to contracts in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if specified targets are achieved. Incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated and are probable are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded. Program Accounting Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales related to its programs. Program accounting is applicable to products manufactured for delivery under production-type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contracts and years. Under program accounting, inventoriable production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced, and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. We recognize sales for commercial airplane deliveries as each unit is completed and accepted by the customer. Sales recognized represent the price negotiated with the customer, adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. The amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effects on program margins are recognized prospectively except in cases where the program is determined to have a reach-forward loss in which case the loss is recognized in the current period. See Note 19. Concession Sharing Arrangements We account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their purchase of products and services as a reduction to revenue when the related products and services are delivered. The sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendors products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products. Spare Parts Revenue We recognize sales of spare parts upon delivery and the amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost. Service Revenue Service revenue is recognized when the service is performed with the exception of U.S. government service agreements, which are accounted for using contract accounting. Service activities primarily include: support agreements associated with military aircraft and helicopter contracts, ongoing maintenance of International Space Station, commercial Delta launches and technical and flight operation services for commercial aircraft. Service revenue and associated cost of sales from pay-in-advance subscription fees are deferred and recognized as services are rendered. Financial Services Revenue We record financial services revenue associated with sales-type/finance leases, operating leases, and notes receivable. Lease and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type/finance leases, we record an asset at lease inception. This asset is recorded at the aggregate future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized as Cost of services in the period in which the declines occur. For operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets, included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated residual value, using the straight-line method. We periodically review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense. For notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note. Reinsurance Revenue Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Astro Ltd., participates in a reinsurance pool for workers compensation. The member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $129 , $144 and $139 during 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were $128 , $142 and $123 during 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Revenues and costs are presented net in Cost of services in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fleet Support We provide assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation to the operators of all our commercial airplane models. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, and technical consulting support. This activity continues throughout the aircrafts operational life. Services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire models fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services. Research and Development Research and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design, testing, and bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers. Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with our contract accounting policy. We have certain research and development arrangements that meet the requirement for best efforts research and development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expense rather than as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of $326 , $332 and $355 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We have established cost sharing arrangements with some suppliers for the 787 program. Our cost sharing arrangements state that the supplier contributions are for reimbursements of costs we incur for experimentation, basic design, and testing activities during the 787 development. In each arrangement, we retain substantial rights to the 787 part or component covered by the arrangement. The amounts received from these cost sharing arrangements are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses since we have no obligation to refund any amounts received per the arrangements regardless of the outcome of the development efforts. Specifically, under the terms of each agreement, payments received from suppliers for their share of the costs are typically based on milestones and are recognized as earned when we achieve the milestone events and no ongoing obligation on our part exists. In the event we receive a milestone payment prior to the completion of the milestone, the amount is classified in Accrued liabilities until earned. Share-Based Compensation We provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value net of estimated forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. Income Taxes Provisions for federal, state, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Earnings before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. Tax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of Income tax expense. Postretirement Plans The majority of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans. All nonunion and some union employees hired after December 31, 2008 are not covered by defined benefit plans. We also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employees annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). A portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and reflected in inventory at the end of a reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in Shareholders equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities we amortize them over the average future service period of employees. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Postemployment Plans We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated. Environmental Remediation We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations, and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup, and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be able to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable were $159 and $132 at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Inventories Inventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe benefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries and plant services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costs include amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one year. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering. Commercial aircraft programs inventory includes deferred production costs. Deferred production costs represent actual costs incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costs are experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor and other resources) than units produced later in a program because of volume efficiencies and the effects of learning. We expect that these deferred costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost of all units in the program. The determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision is recorded. The determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimate revenue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity. When estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. Used aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value. See Aircraft Valuation within this Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or market. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired inventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs. Included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the ability to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwise recoverable, it would be written off in the current period. We net advances and progress billings on long-term contracts against inventory in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Advances and progress billings in excess of related inventory are reported in Advances and billings in excess of related costs. Precontract Costs We may, from time to time, incur costs to begin fulfilling the statement of work under a specific anticipated contract that we are still negotiating with a customer. If we determine it is probable we will be awarded the specific anticipated contract, then we capitalize the precontract costs we incur, excluding start-up costs which are expensed as incurred. Capitalized precontract costs are included in Inventories, net of advances and progress billings, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Should the contract not be awarded or otherwise determined to no longer be probable of award, the capitalized costs would be written off. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and equipment, from 3 to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over 5 years. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition. Long-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Long-lived assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Asset Retirement Obligations We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material. We also have known conditional asset retirement obligations, such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liabilitys fair value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology, from 5 to 14 years; product know-how, from 3 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 19 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 30 years; and other, from 5 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Investments Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost. The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between 20% and 50% . We classify investment income and loss on our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on whether the investment is operating or non-operating in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, including our share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from certain cost method investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic purposes. Earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on marketable securities, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in Other income/(expense), net. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them. We use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes in fair value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is to include in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For our cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss of a cash flow hedge is reported in earnings immediately. We also hold certain instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For these derivative instruments, the changes in their fair value are also recorded in earnings immediately. Aircraft Valuation Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer subsequently exercises its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments. Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of: ##TABLE_START (1) adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recorded in Inventory and recognized upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) charges to cost of products for adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in Accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_END The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customers requirements; or the scrap market. Trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market. This quarterly valuation process yields results that are typically lower than residual value estimates by independent sources and tends to more accurately reflect results upon the actual placement of the aircraft. Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or market as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer financing. Customer financing Customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivables, and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/finance leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary. We assess the fair value of the assets we own, including equipment under operating leases, assets held for sale or re-lease, and collateral underlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are less than the related assets carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fair values of sales-type/finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables. We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications. Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Allowance for losses on customer financing receivables We record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in a valuation account, the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to two components of receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables. We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the receivable agreement, without regard to any subsequent restructurings. Factors considered in assessing collectibility include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. We determine a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral we would expect to realize. We review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables (after excluding receivables subject to a specific impairment allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for each customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, for example, permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall. Each quarter we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables. Warranties In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material and design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a three to four -year standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards under our authorization. These warranties are included in the programs estimate at completion. On occasion we have made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warranties issued by our BDS segments principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons hardware and are included in the contract cost estimates. These sales are generally accompanied by a six to twelve -month warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate. We provide guarantees to certain commercial airplane customers which include compensation provisions for failure to meet specified aircraft performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets, and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of the related aircraft. We have agreements that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to customers for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as a reduction in Cost of products at delivery of the related aircraft. These performance warranties and claims against suppliers are included in the programs estimate at completion. Supplier Penalties We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully anticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts. Guarantees We record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. For a residual value guarantee where we received a cash premium, the liability is equal to the cash premium received at the guarantees inception. For credit guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditors default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable, for each future period the credit guarantee will be outstanding. If at inception of a guarantee, we determine there is a probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value of the guarantee as described above or (b) the probable contingent loss amount. Note 2  Acquisitions On August 5, 2010, we acquired Argon ST, Inc. (Argon) for $782 , net of cash acquired. Argon develops command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) and, combat systems. The acquisition was part of our strategy to expand our capabilities to address the C4ISR, cyber and intelligence markets. Argons results of operations from the acquisition date are included in the Network  Space Systems (NSS) segment. Goodwill has been recorded in NSS, Global Services  Support (GSS) and Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA) segments. The final allocation of the purchase price is as follows: ##TABLE_START Accounts receivable $66 Inventory Property, plant and equipment Goodwill Finite-lived intangible assets (1) Other assets Accounts payable (14 ) Accrued liabilities (69 ) Advances and billings in excess of related costs (8 ) Deferred income taxes (38 ) Total net assets acquired $782 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Finite-lived intangible assets have a weighted average amortization period of 13 years and include $133 of Developed technology and $69 of Customer base. ##TABLE_END Note 3  Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Commercial Airplanes  Boeing Military Aircraft  Network  Space Systems  Global Services  Support  Total Balance at January 1, 2010 $2,083  $848  $1,102  $286  $4,319 Argon acquisition      Other acquisitions      Goodwill adjustments       Balance at December 31, 2010 $2,110  $1,041  $1,461  $325  $4,937 Acquisitions        Goodwill adjustments (4 )    (4 )    (8 ) Balance at December 31, 2011 $2,106  $1,041  $1,473  $325  $4,945 Acquisitions     Goodwill adjustments  (1 )  Balance at December 31, 2012 $2,125  $1,041 $1,472 $397 $5,035 ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we had indefinite-lived intangible assets with carrying amounts of $497 relating to trade names. The gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization of our acquired finite-lived intangible assets were as follows at December 31: ##TABLE_START   Gross Carrying Amount  Accumulated Amortization  Gross Carrying Amount  Accumulated Amortization Distribution rights $2,132  $388  $1,915  $295 Product know-how    Customer base    Developed technology    Other    Total $4,335  $1,721  $4,056  $1,509 ##TABLE_ENDAmortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $213 and $203 . Estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding years is as follows: 2013  $191 ; 2014  $185 ; 2015  $176 ; 2016  $160 ; and 2017  $152 . During 2012 and 2011 we acquired $277 and $269 of finite-lived intangible assets, of which $213 and $256 related to non-cash investing and financing transactions. Total acquired finite-lived intangibles of $352 and $335 remain unpaid as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Note 4  Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earnings per share for common shares and participating securities. The undistributed earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed earnings. Basic earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. The elements used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows: (In millions - except per share amounts) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Net earnings $3,900  $4,018  $3,307 Less: earnings available to participating securities   Net earnings available to common shareholders $3,892  $4,009  $3,298 Basic      Basic weighted average shares outstanding 758.0  746.6  738.1 Less: participating securities 2.3  2.5  3.1 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 755.7  744.1  735.0 Diluted      Basic weighted average shares outstanding 758.0  746.6  738.1 Dilutive potential common shares (1) 5.8  6.5  6.2 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 763.8  753.1  744.3 Less: participating securities 2.3  2.5  3.1 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 761.5  750.6  741.2 Net earnings per share:      Basic $5.15  $5.39  $4.49 Diluted 5.11  5.34  4.45 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Diluted EPS includes any dilutive impact of stock options, restricted stock units and Performance Awards. ##TABLE_END The shares included in the following table were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect was antidilutive.

Our effective income tax rates were 34.0% , 25.6% and 26.5% for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Our 2012 effective tax rate was higher than prior years, primarily due to tax benefits of $397 and $371 recorded in 2011 and 2010 as a result of federal income tax audit settlements. The absence of research and development tax credits also contributed to the higher tax rate in 2012. Our 2011 effective tax rate was lower than 2010 , primarily due to an income tax charge of $150 recorded during the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. The research and development credit expired on December 31, 2011. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 that retroactively renews the research and development credit for 2012 and extends the credit through December 31, 2013. As tax law changes are recognized in the period in which new legislation is enacted, the 2012 RD credit of approximately $150 will be reflected as a discrete item in our income tax rate for the first quarter of 2013. The following is a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% to our effective income tax rate: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   U.S. federal statutory tax 35.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % Research and development credits 0.8  (2.7 )  (3.5 ) Tax on international activities (1.2 )  (0.6 )  (1.2 ) Tax deductible dividends (0.7 )  (0.8 )  (0.9 ) State income tax provision, net of effect on U.S. federal tax 0.8  0.7  1.8 Medicare Part D law change     3.3 Federal audit settlement  (7.4 )  (8.2 ) Other provision adjustments (0.7 )  1.4  0.2 Effective income tax rate 34.0 %  25.6 %  26.5 % ##TABLE_ENDFederal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2007. During the first quarter of 2012 we filed an appeal with the IRS for the 2007-2008 tax years. The 2009-2010 IRS audit began in the second quarter of 2012. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2001-2012 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years. Significant components of our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Retiree health care accruals $2,867  $2,820 Inventory and long-term contract methods of income recognition, fixed assets and other (net of valuation allowance of $27 and $27) (7,151 )  (5,189 ) Partnerships and joint ventures (162 )  (228 ) Other employee benefits accruals 1,427  1,352 In-process research and development related to acquisitions  Net operating loss, credit and capital loss carryovers (net of valuation allowance of $94 and $74)  Pension asset 6,232  5,315 Customer and commercial financing (1,078 )  (1,471 ) Unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries (49 )  (66 ) Other net unrealized losses (17 )  Net deferred tax assets (1) $2,413  $3,141 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Of the deferred tax asset for net operating loss and credit carryovers, $201 expires in years ending from December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2032 and $106 may be carried over indefinitely. ##TABLE_END Net deferred tax assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Deferred tax assets $16,580  $16,181 Deferred tax liabilities (14,046 )  (12,939 ) Valuation allowance (121 )  (101 ) Net deferred tax assets $2,413  $3,141 ##TABLE_ENDThe measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Included in the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2012 and 2011 are deferred tax assets in the amounts of $10,210 and $9,743 related to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We have provided for U.S. deferred income taxes and foreign withholding tax in the amount of $49 on undistributed earnings not considered permanently reinvested in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding tax on the remainder of undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested and it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that may be payable upon distribution. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position were as follows: interest of $11 and $48 and penalties of $11 and $10 . The amounts of interest benefit were $43 , $94 , and $105 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The interest benefit recorded during 2012 was primarily related to the settlement of non-US audits. The interest benefits recorded during 2011 and 2010 were primarily related to the 2004-2006 and 1998-2003 federal audit settlements, respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: ##TABLE_START    Unrecognized tax benefits  January 1 $939  $1,198  $1,787 Gross increases  tax positions in prior periods   Gross decreases  tax positions in prior periods (20 )  (383 )  (465 ) Gross increases  current-period tax positions   Gross decreases  current-period tax positions (1 )  (15 )  (40 ) Settlements (1 )  (42 )  (254 ) Lapse of statute of limitations  (1 )  (1 ) Unrecognized tax benefits  December 31 $1,055  $939  $1,198 ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1,055 , $939 , and $1,198 of which $945 , $838 , and $1,074 would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. As of December 31, 2011, these amounts are primarily associated with U.S. federal tax issues such as the amount of research and development tax credits claimed, the domestic production activities deductions claimed, and U.S. taxation of foreign earnings. Also included in these amounts are accruals for domestic state tax issues such as the allocation of income among various state tax jurisdictions and the amount of state tax credits claimed. Note 6  Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   U.S. government contracts $2,788  $2,950 Defense, Space  Security customers (1) 1,196  1,100 Commercial Airplanes customers  Reinsurance receivables  Other  Less valuation allowance (82 )  (53 ) Total $5,608  $5,793 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Excludes U.S. government contracts ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes our accounts receivable under long-term contracts that were not billable or related to outstanding claims as of December 31 : ##TABLE_START Unbillable  Claims      Current $1,316  $1,174  $26  $49 Expected to be collected after one year    Total $2,046  $1,672  $89  $258 ##TABLE_ENDUnder contract accounting unbillable receivables on long-term contracts arise when the sales or revenues based on performance attainment, though appropriately recognized, cannot be billed yet under terms of the contract as of the balance sheet date. Any adjustment for the credit quality of unbillable receivables, if required, would be recorded as a direct reduction of revenue. Factors considered in assessing the collectability of unbillable receivables include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. Unbillable receivables related to commercial customers expected to be collected after one year were  $230 and $192 at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Accounts receivable related to claims are items that we believe are earned, but are subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate realization. Accounts receivable as of December 31, 2012 , includes $112 of unbillable receivables on a long-term contract with LightSquared, LLC (LightSquared) related to the construction of two commercial satellites. One of the satellites has been delivered, and the other is substantially complete but remains in Boeings possession. On May 14, 2012, LightSquared filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. We believe that our rights in the second satellite and related ground-segment assets are sufficient to protect the value of our rec eivables in the event LightSquared fails to make payments as contractually required or rejects its contract with us. As a result, we do not expect to incur any losses related to these receivables in connection with the LightSquared bankruptcy. Accounts receivable, other than those described above, expected to be collected after one year are not material. Note 7  Inventories Inventories at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Long-term contracts in progress $15,130  $13,587 Commercial aircraft programs 40,389  35,080 Commercial spare parts, used aircraft, general stock materials and other 7,206  7,832 Inventory before advances and progress billings 62,725  56,499 Less advances and progress billings (24,974 )  (24,259 ) Total $37,751  $32,240 ##TABLE_ENDLong-Term Contracts in Progress Long-term contracts in progress included Delta launch program inventory that is being sold at cost to United Launch Alliance (ULA) under an inventory supply agreement that terminates on March 31, 2021. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the inventory balance, net of advances, was $725 and $1,085 . At December 31, 2012 , $534 of this inventory related to unsold launches. ULA is continuing to assess the future of the Delta II program. In the event ULA is unable to sell additional Delta II inventory, our earnings could be reduced by up to $35 . See Note 13 . Inventory balances included $237 and $236 subject to claims or other uncertainties relating to the A-12 program at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . See Note 21 . Capitalized precontract costs of $238 and $1,728 at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , are included in inventories. Commercial Aircraft Programs At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 787 program: $21,289 and $16,098 of work in process (including deferred production costs at December 31, 2012 of $15,929 and $10,753 ), $1,908 and $1,770 of supplier advances, and $2,339 and $1,914 of unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs. At December 31, 2012 , $12,810 of 787 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and $5,458 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 747 program: $1,292 and $448 of deferred production costs, net of previously recorded reach-forward losses, and $683 and $852 of unamortized tooling costs. At December 31, 2012 , $1,048 of 747 deferred production costs and unamortized tooling are expected to be recovere d from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and $927 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. Commercial aircraft programs inventory included amounts credited in cash or other consideration (early issue sales consideration) to airline customers totaling $2,989 and $2,564 at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Note 8  Customer Financing Customer financing at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Financing receivables:    Investment in sales-type/finance leases $1,850  $2,037 Notes  Operating lease equipment, at cost, less accumulated depreciation of $628 and $765 2,038  1,991 Gross customer financing 4,480  4,842 Less allowance for losses on receivables (60 )  (70 ) Total $4,420  $4,772 ##TABLE_ENDThe components of investment in sales-type/finance leases at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Minimum lease payments receivable $1,987  $2,272 Estimated residual value of leased assets  Unearned income (681 )  (776 ) Total $1,850  $2,037 ##TABLE_ENDOperating lease equipment primarily includes large commercial jet aircraft and regional jet aircraft. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , operating lease equipment included $354 and $521 of equipment available for sale or re-lease. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we had firm lease commitments for $266 and $476 of this equipment. When our Commercial Airplanes segment is unable to immediately sell used aircraft, it may place the aircraft under an operating lease. It may also provide customer financing with a note receivable. The carrying amount of the Commercial Airplanes segment used aircraft under operating leases and notes receivable included as a component of customer financing totaled $223 and $357 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Financing receivable balances evaluated for impairment at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Individually evaluated for impairment $616  $854 Collectively evaluated for impairment 1,826  1,997 Total financing receivables $2,442  $2,851 ##TABLE_ENDWe determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we individually evaluated for impairment customer financing receivables of $616 and $854 and determined that $446 and $485 were impaired. We recorded no allowance for losses on these impaired receivables as the collateral values exceed the carrying values of the receivables. The average recorded investment in impaired financing receivables for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 , was $466 , $517 and $88 , respectively. Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Income is recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer. Interest income recognized on such receivables was $6 , $0 and $9 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we had no material receivables that were greater than 30 days past due. The change in the allowance for losses on financing receivables for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 , consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    Beginning balance - January 1 ($70 )  ($353 )  ($302 ) Customer financing valuation benefit/(provision)   (51 ) Reduction in customer financing assets    Ending balance - December 31 ($60 )  ($70 )  ($353 ) Collectively evaluated for impairment ($60 )  ($70 )  ($353 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customer financing receivables are customer credit ratings, default rates and collateral values. We assign internal credit ratings for all customers and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers. Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies. The customer financing valuation benefit recorded in 2011 was primarily driven by changes in the internal credit rating categories assigned to our receivable balances from AirTran Holdings, LLC. Our financing receivable balances at December 31 by internal credit rating category are shown below: ##TABLE_START Rating categories  BBB $1,201  $1,316 BB  B  CCC  D  Other  Total carrying value of financing receivables $2,442  $2,851 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2012 , our allowance primarily related to receivables with ratings of CCC and we applied default rates that averaged 46% to the exposure associated with those receivables. In the fourth quarter of 2011, American Airlines Inc. (American Airlines) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. We believe that our customer financing receivables from American Airlines of $524 are sufficiently collateralized such that we do not expect to incur losses related to those receivables and have not recorded an allowance for losses as of December 31, 2012 as a result of the bankruptcy. Customer Financing Exposure Customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance and may be subject to reduced valuation with market decline. Declines in collateral values are also a significant driver of our allowance for losses. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have experienced greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft. Our customer financing portfolio consists primarily of financing receivables for out-of-production aircraft. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance and overall market conditions. The majority of customer financing carrying values are concentrated in the following aircraft models: ##TABLE_START   717 Aircraft ($465 and $480 accounted for as operating leases) (1) $1,781  $1,906 757 Aircraft ($454 and $451 accounted for as operating leases) (1)  MD-80 Aircraft ($0 and $0 accounted for as operating leases) (1)(2)  737 Aircraft ($193 and $242 accounted for as operating leases)  787 Aircraft ($286 and $0 accounted for as operating leases)   MD-11 Aircraft ($269 and $321 accounted for as operating leases) (1)  767 Aircraft ($63 and $103 accounted for as operating leases)  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Out-of-production aircraft ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Disclosure omitted from 2011 financial statements ##TABLE_END Charges related to customer financing asset impairment for the years ended December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Boeing Capital $73  $109  $85 Other Boeing (15 )  (36 )  Total $58  $73  $170 ##TABLE_ENDScheduled receipts on customer financing are as follows: ##TABLE_START Year      Beyond 2017 Principal payments on notes receivable $194  $101  $57  $41  $42  $157 Sales-type/finance lease payments receivable      Operating lease equipment payments receivable      ##TABLE_ENDNote 9  Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Land $531  $526 Buildings and land improvements 10,696  10,285 Machinery and equipment 11,847  11,353 Construction in progress 1,231  1,142 Gross property, plant and equipment 24,305  23,306 Less accumulated depreciation (14,645 )  (13,993 ) Total $9,660  $9,313 ##TABLE_ENDDepreciation expense was $1,248 , $1,119 and $1,096 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Interest capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 totaled $74 , $57 and $48 , respectively. Rental expense for leased properties was $276 , $270 and $269 , for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. At December 31, 2012 , minimum rental payments under capital leases aggregated $152 . Minimum rental payments under operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more aggregated $1,386 , net of sublease payments of $18 at December 31, 2012 . Payments due under operating and capital leases net of sublease amounts, and non-cancellable future rentals during the next five years are as follows: ##TABLE_START      Minimum operating lease payments, net of sublease amounts $212  $192  $135  $111  $94 Minimum capital lease payments, net of sublease amounts     ##TABLE_ENDAccounts payable related to purchases of property, plant and equipment were $234 and $200 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 .

The $356 includes $147 related to a payment made by us under a bank guarantee on behalf of Sea Launch and $209 related to loans (partner loans) we made to Sea Launch. The net amounts owed to Boeing by each of the partners are as follows; S.P. Koroley Rocket and Space Corporation Energia of Russia  $223 , PO Yuzhnoye Mashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukraine  $89 and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine  $44 . Although each partner is contractually obligated to reimburse us for its share of the bank guarantee, the Russian and Ukrainian partners have raised defenses to enforcement and contested our claims. On October 19, 2009, we filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launch partners of the  $147 bank guarantee payment. On October 7, 2010, the arbitrator ruled that the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter but did not resolve the merits of our claim. We filed a notice appealing the arbitrators ruling on January 11, 2011. The Ukrainian partners responded to our appeal on June 30, 2012 and the Russian partner responded on July 3, 2012. We filed replies on September 20, 2012. On February 1, 2013, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launch partners of the $147 bank guarantee payment and the $209 partner loan obligations. We believe the partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and remedies. In the event we are unable to secure reimbursement of $147 related to our payment under the bank guarantee and $209 related to partner loans made to Sea Launch, we could incur additional pre-tax charges of up to $356 . Note 12  Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Accrued compensation and employee benefit costs $5,769  $5,546 Environmental  Product warranties 1,572  1,046 Forward loss recognition  Other 4,557  4,388 Total $12,995  $12,239 ##TABLE_ENDEnvironmental The following table summarizes environmental remediation activity during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 . ##TABLE_START   Beginning balance  January 1 $758  $721 Reductions for payments made (121 )  (118 ) Changes in estimates  Ending balance  December 31 $710  $758 ##TABLE_ENDThe liabilities recorded represent our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred to remediate sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios which include the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. There are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by $865 and $1,003 . Product Warranties The following table summarizes product warranty activity recorded during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 . ##TABLE_START   Beginning balance  January 1 $1,046  $1,076 Additions for current year deliveries  Reductions for payments made (315 )  (269 ) Changes in estimates  Ending balance  December 31 $1,572  $1,046 ##TABLE_ENDCommercial Aircraft Commitments In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and airline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer. Trade-in commitment agreements at December 31, 2012 have expiration dates from 2013 through 2023 . At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , total contractual trade-in commitments were $1,535 and $273 . As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we estimated that it was probable we would be obligated to perform on certain of these commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling $108 and $30 and the fair value of the related trade-in aircraft was $108 and $27 . Financing Commitments Financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, totaled $18,083 and $15,866 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 . The estimated earliest potential funding dates for these commitments as of December 31, 2012 are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Total $1,341 2,591 3,997 3,457 2,796 Thereafter 3,901  $18,083 ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2012  $17,014 of these financing commitments related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. We have concluded that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralization and interest rates, under which funding would be provided. Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds We have entered into standby letters of credit agreements and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $4,545 and $6,199 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Commitments to ULA We and Lockheed Martin Corporation have each committed to provide ULA with up to $494 of additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. See Note 7 . C-17 At December 31, 2012 , our backlog included 5 C-17 aircraft under contract with the U.S. Air Force (USAF) and international orders for 10 C-17 aircraft. We are currently producing C-17 aircraft at a rate of 10 per year. Should additional orders not materialize, it is reasonably possible that we will decide in 2013 to end production of the C-17 at a future date. We are still evaluating the full financial impact of a potential production shutdown, including pension curtailment charges, and any recovery that would be available from the U.S. government. Such recovery from the U.S. government would not include the costs incurred by us resulting from our direction to suppliers to begin working on aircraft beyond those currently under contract. At December 31, 2012 , we had approximately $245 of inventory expenditures and potential termination liabilities to suppliers associated with 12 aircraft for international customers not currently under contract. U.S. Government Defense Budget/Sequestration In August 2011, the Budget Control Act reduced the United States Department of Defense ( U.S. DoD ) top line budget by approximately $490 billion through 2021. In addition, U.S. government expenditures are subject to the potential for further reductions, generally referred to as  sequestration  . Sequestration would result in additional reductions of approximately $500 billion from the defense top line budget through 2021. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has estimated that sequestration would reduce non-exempt defense discretionary accounts during U.S. government fiscal year 2013 by approximately 9.4% (excluding military personnel accounts). The OMB has further stated that the budget for Overseas Contingency Operations and any unobligated balances in prior year funds would be included in aggregate reductions, but has otherwise indicated that it cannot yet assess the impact of sequestration at the program, project, and activity level. The U.S. DoD has indicated that such reductions might require the termination of certain, as yet undetermined, procurement programs and other U.S. government customers, such as NASA and various intelligence agencies, may be required to take comparable actions. Any such impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows. Company Owned Life Insurance McDonnell Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life insurance policies with a cash surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the cash surrender value was $423 and $397 and the total loans were $400 and $377 . As we have the right to offset the loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Note 13  Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees. The following table provides quantitative data regarding our third party guarantees. The maximum potential payments represent a worst-case scenario, and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset our payments under guarantees.

Estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date. Indemnifications to ULA In 2006, we agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 of Boeing Delta launch program inventory included in contributed assets plus $1,860 of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021 . Since inception, ULA has consumed $1,223 of the $1,360 of inventory that was contributed by us and has yet to consume $137 . ULA has made advance payments of $1,080 to us and we have recorded revenues and cost of sales of $766 under the inventory supply agreement through December 31, 2012 . ULA is continuing to assess the future of the Delta II program. In the event ULA is unable to sell additional Delta II inventory, our earnings could be reduced by up to $35 . We agreed to indemnify ULA against potential losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the USAF for four satellite missions. We believe ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing. In December 2008, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value for two satellite missions. In March 2009, the USAF issued a denial of that claim. In June 2009, ULA filed a notice of appeal, and in October 2009, ULA filed a complaint before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) for a contract adjustment for the price of the two satellite missions. In September 2009, the USAF exercised its option for a third satellite mission. During the third quarter of 2010, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value of the third mission. The USAF did not exercise an option for a fourth mission prior to the expiration. In March 2011, ULA filed a notice of appeal before the ASBCA, seeking to re-price the third mission. A hearing before the ASBCA has been scheduled for November 18, 2013. If ULA is unsuccessful in obtaining additional pricing, we may be responsible for a portion of the shortfall and may record up to $279 in pre-tax losses associated with the three missions, representing up to $261 for the indemnification payment and up to $18 for our portion of additional contract losses incurred by ULA. Potential payments for Other Delta contracts include $85 related to deferred support costs. In June 2011, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) notified ULA that it had determined that $271 of deferred support costs are not recoverable under government contracts. In December 2011, the DCMA notified ULA of the potential non-recoverability of an additional $114 of deferred production costs. The DCMA has not yet issued a final decision related to the recoverability of the $114 . ULA and Boeing believe that all costs are recoverable and in November 2011, ULA filed a certified claim with the USAF for collection of deferred support and production costs. The USAF issued a final decision denying ULAs certified claim in May 2012. On June 14, 2012, Boeing and ULA filed a suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking recovery of the deferred support and production costs from the U.S. government. On November 9, 2012, the U.S. government filed an answer to our claim and asserted a counterclaim for credits that it alleges were offset by deferred support cost invoices. We believe that the U.S. governments counterclaim is without merit, and have filed an answer challenging it on multiple grounds. On February 14, 2013, the Court will convene a scheduling conference to discuss the next stages of the litigation. If, contrary to our belief, it is determined that some or all of the deferred support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record pre-tax losses and make indemnification payments to ULA for up to $317 of the costs questioned by the DCMA. Other Indemnifications As part of the 2004 sale agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation related to the sale of Boeing Capitals (BCC) Commercial Financial Services business, BCC is involved in a loss sharing arrangement for losses on transferred portfolio assets, such as asset sales, provisions for loss or asset impairment charges offset by gains from asset sales. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , our maximum future cash exposure to losses associated with the loss sharing arrangement was $137 and $212 and our accrued liability under the loss sharing arrangement was $32 and $51 . In conjunction with our sales of the Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and the sale of our Commercial Airplanes facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma in 2005, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental contamination and certain other items. As it is impossible to assess whether there will be damages in the future or the amounts thereof (if any), we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities. Therefore, no liability has been recorded. There have been no claims submitted to date. Residual Value Guarantees We have issued various residual value guarantees principally to facilitate the sale and financing of certain commercial aircraft. Under these guarantees, we are obligated to make payments to the guaranteed party if the related aircraft or equipment fair values fall below a specified amount at a future time. These obligations are collateralized principally by the underlying commercial aircraft and expire within the next 6 years. Industrial Revenue Bonds Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by the City of Wichita were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property at our Wichita site. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a ten-year property tax abatement and a sales tax exemption from the Kansas Department of Revenue. We record the property on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, along with a capital lease obligation to repay the proceeds of the IRB. We have also purchased the IRBs and therefore are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the property purchased with the IRB proceeds. The capital lease obligation and IRB asset are recorded net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the assets and liabilities associated with the City of Wichita IRBs were $738 and $783 . Note 14  Debt Interest incurred, including amounts capitalized, was $625 , $683 and $729 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Interest expense recorded by BCC is reflected as a separate line item on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and is included in Earnings from operations. Total Company interest payments were $614 , $626 and $670 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. We have $4,600 currently available under credit line agreements, of which $2,300 is a 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in November 2013 and $2,300 is a five-year credit facility expiring in November 2017 . The 364-day credit facility has a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration date. We continue to be in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt or credit facility agreements. Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Consolidated Total  BCC Only  Consolidated Total  BCC Only Unsecured debt securities $1,224  $624  $2,186  $837 Non-recourse debt and notes    Capital lease obligations    Other notes     Total $1,436  $648  $2,353  $879 ##TABLE_ENDDebt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Boeing Capital debt:    Unsecured debt securities    1.54%  7.58% due through 2023 $2,465  $3,308 Non-recourse debt and notes    4.12%  4.84% notes due through 2013  Capital lease obligations    0.91% due through 2015  Boeing Capital debt subtotal $2,511  $3,400 Other Boeing debt:    Unsecured debt securities    3.50%  5.00% due through 2020 $2,686  $3,381 5.13%  6.88% due through 2043 2,991  2,990 7.25%  8.75% due through 2043 1,642  1,991 Non-recourse debt and notes    Enhanced equipment trust  Capital lease obligations due through 2017  Other notes  Other Boeing debt subtotal $7,898  $8,971 Total debt $10,409  $12,371 ##TABLE_ENDOther Boeing debt includes $300 due August 15, 2024 that was redeemable at the holders option on August 15, 2012.

At December 31, 2012 , $277 of debt (non-recourse debt and notes and capital lease obligations) was collateralized by customer financing assets totaling $461 . Scheduled principal payments for debt and minimum capital lease obligations for the next five years are as follows: ##TABLE_START      Boeing Capital $648  $526  $16  $505  $5 Other Boeing     Total $1,442  $1,364  $860  $1,052  $47 ##TABLE_ENDNote 15  Postretirement Plans The majority of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans. All nonunion and some union employees hired after December 31, 2008 are not covered by defined benefit plans. We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans participants, and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for future benefit payments. We also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for approximately half those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered by most United Auto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage. The funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). We have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Pension plan assets, net, and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in Accrued liabilities. The components of net periodic benefit cost were as follows: ##TABLE_START Pension  Other Postretirement Plans Years ended December 31,      Service cost $1,649  $1,406  $1,176  $146  $221  $121 Interest cost 3,005  3,116  3,002    Expected return on plan assets (3,831 )  (3,741 )  (3,850 )  (7 )  (6 )  (6 ) Amortization of prior service costs    (197 )  (96 )  (78 ) Recognized net actuarial loss 1,937  1,254     Settlement and curtailment loss    (1 )   Net periodic benefit cost $3,010  $2,343  $1,367  $373  $784  $497             Net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations $2,407  $1,648  $1,101  $543  $692  $480 ##TABLE_ENDDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2011, we determined the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for certain other postretirement benefit plans was understated. As a result, we recognized an additional $294 of postretirement benefit obligations at September 30, 2011. This increased net periodic benefit cost during 2011 by $184 , which includes service cost of $73 , interest cost of $68 and recognized net actuarial loss of $43 . Had the understatement been recorded at December 31, 2010, the postretirement benefit obligation would have increased by $274 from $8,546 to $8,820 . Management believes that these understatements were not material. Under our accounting policy, a portion of net periodic benefit cost is allocated to production as inventoried costs. Of the $184 increase in net periodic benefit cost described above, the associated cost included in Earnings from operations was $161 for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, with the remaining cost of $23 classified as inventory. The following tables show changes in the benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status of both pensions and OPB for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Benefit obligation balances presented below reflect the PBO for our pension plans, and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations (APBO) for our OPB plans. ##TABLE_START Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits     Change in benefit obligation        Beginning balance $67,651  $59,106  $7,997  $8,546 Service cost 1,649  1,406   Interest cost 3,005  3,116   Plan participants contributions      Amendments    (719 ) Actuarial loss/(gain) 6,378  6,586  (53 )  (63 ) Settlement/curtailment/acquisitions/dispositions, net (76 )  (104 )  (1 )  Gross benefits paid (2,744 )  (2,644 )  (474 )  (503 ) Medicare Part D and other subsidies      Exchange rate adjustment  (10 )   (3 ) Ending balance $75,895  $67,651  $7,981  $7,997 Change in plan assets        Beginning balance at fair value $51,051  $49,252  $102  $98 Actual return on plan assets 6,300  3,953   Company contribution 1,550    Plan participants contributions    Settlement/curtailment/acquisitions/dispositions, net (71 )  (104 )    Benefits paid (2,669 )  (2,581 )  (21 )  (20 ) Exchange rate adjustment  (9 )     Ending balance at fair value $56,178  $51,051  $110  $102 Amounts recognized in statement of financial position at December 31 consist of:        Pension plan assets, net 1     Other accrued liabilities (71 ) (64 )  (343 )  (375 ) Accrued retiree health care  (7,528 )  (7,520 ) Accrued pension plan liability, net (19,651 ) (16,537 )     Net amount recognized ($19,717 )  ($16,600 )  ($7,871 )  ($7,895 ) ##TABLE_ENDAmounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits     Net actuarial loss $26,387  $24,448  $1,651  $1,885 Prior service cost/(credit)  1,118  (799 )  (1,008 ) Total recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss $27,291  $25,566  $852  $877 ##TABLE_ENDThe estimated amount that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during the year ended December 31, 2013 is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pensions  Other Postretirement Benefits Recognized net actuarial loss $2,272  $102 Amortization of prior service costs/(credits)  (180 ) Total $2,467  ($78 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe ABO for all pension plans was $69,312 and $61,902 at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Key information for our plans with ABO in excess of plan assets as of December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Projected benefit obligation $75,851  $67,418 Accumulated benefit obligation 69,272  61,675 Fair value of plan assets 56,129  50,820 ##TABLE_ENDAssumptions The following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31 of each year and the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year. ##TABLE_START December 31,   Discount rate:      Pension 3.80 %  4.40 %  5.30 % Other postretirement benefits 3.30 %  4.00 %  4.90 % Expected return on plan assets 7.50 %  7.75 %  7.75 % Rate of compensation increase 4.00 %  3.90 %  5.20 % ##TABLE_ENDThe discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high quality bonds that are rated as Aa or better as of the measurement date by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized. The yield curve is fitted to yields developed from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. A portfolio of about 400 bonds is used to construct the yield curve. Since corporate bond yields are generally not available at maturities beyond 30 years, it is assumed that spot rates will remain level beyond that 30-year point. The present value of each plans benefits is calculated by applying the spot/discount rates to projected benefit cash flows. All bonds are U.S. issues, with a minimum outstanding of $50. The pension funds expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the upcoming plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five -year moving average of plan assets. As of December 31, 2012 , the MRVA is approximately $3,581 less than the fair market value of assets. Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows: ##TABLE_START December 31,   Health care cost trend rate assumed next year 7.50 %  7.50 %  7.50 % Ultimate trend rate 5.00 %  5.00 %  5.00 % Year that trend reached ultimate rate   ##TABLE_ENDAssumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. To determine the health care cost trend rates we look at a combination of information including ongoing claims cost monitoring, annual statistical analyses of claims data, reconciliation of forecast claims against actual claims, review of trend assumptions of other plan sponsors and national health trends, and adjustments for plan design changes, workforce changes, and changes in plan participant behavior. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect: ##TABLE_START  Increase  Decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost $46  ($40 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation  (700 ) ##TABLE_ENDPlan Assets Investment Strategy The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive, total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified. We periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investment benchmarks for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions (such as private equity and real estate), and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced on a monthly basis. The actual allocations for the pension assets at December 31 and target allocations by asset class, were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Percentage of Plan Assets   Target Allocations  Asset Class    Fixed income %  %  %  % Global equity    Private equity    Real estate and real assets    Global strategies    Hedge funds    Total %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDFixed income securities are invested broadly and primarily in long duration instruments. Global equity securities are invested broadly in U.S. and non-U.S. companies which are in various industries and countries and through a range of market capitalizations. Real estate and real assets include global private investments and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) and global infrastructure stocks). Real estate includes but is not limited to investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include but are not limited to investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber), commodities and infrastructure. Private equity investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) and fund-of-funds that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies. Global strategies seek to capitalize on inefficiencies identified across different asset classes or markets, primarily using long-short positions in derivatives and physical securities. Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to, event driven, relative value, long-short and market neutral. Investment managers are retained for explicit investment roles specified by contractual investment guidelines. Certain investment managers are authorized to invest in derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve the desired market exposure of a security or an index, transfer value-added performance between asset classes, achieve the desired currency exposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation. As a percentage of total plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were 10.0% and 3.9% for fixed income, including to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and (0.3%) and 3.5% for global equity, currency overlay and commodities at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Risk Management In managing the plan assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach and are integral to the overall investment strategy. Further, asset classes are constructed to achieve diversification by investment strategy, by investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored regularly through the custodian. Credit parameters for counterparties have been established for managers permitted to trade over-the-counter derivatives. Valuation is governed through several types of procedures, including reviews of manager valuation policies, custodian valuation processes, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconciliation, and periodic, security-specific valuation testing . Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 . The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011  Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fixed income securities:         Corporate $14,363 $14,360 $3 $13,921 $13,910 $11 U.S. government and agencies 4,921 4,921 4,500 4,500 Mortgage backed and asset backed 191 714 11 Municipal 1,770 1,770 1,909  1,906 Sovereign 1,045 1,045 1,045  1,045  Common/collective/pooled funds 2,346 $17 2,329 1,182 $214  Other 1 216 215 Derivatives:         Assets 1 25 Liabilities (23 ) (23 ) (41 ) (41 ) Cash equivalents and other short-term investments 2,687 2,224 3,187 2,634 Currency overlay derivatives:         Assets 56 89 Liabilities (55 ) (55 ) (94 ) (94 ) Equity securities:         U.S. common and preferred stock 6,144 6,144 4,837 4,837 Non-U.S. common and preferred stock 7,421 7,421 6,258 6,257 Common/collective/pooled funds 2,294 1,950 2,235 2,208 Derivatives:         Assets 19 4 Liabilities (9 ) (9 ) (5 ) (5 ) Private equity 2,942 2,916 2,869 2,859 Real estate and real assets:         Real estate 2,765 14 2,128 2,334 6 1,819 Real assets 1,327 377 776 23 Derivatives:         Assets 1 Liabilities (2 ) (2 ) Global strategies 2,147 2,147 2,202 2,127 Hedge funds 2,736 1,263 1,473 2,451 2,451 Total $55,903 $17,087 $31,071 $7,745 $50,614 $14,693 $28,144 $7,777          Cash $94    $206    Receivables       Payables (207 )    (272 )    Total $56,178    $51,051    ##TABLE_ENDFixed income securities are primarily valued upon a market approach, using matrix pricing and considering a securitys relationship to other securities for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or an income approach, converting future cash flows to a single present value amount. Inputs used in developing fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads. Cash equivalents and other short-term investments, which are used to pay benefits, are primarily held in registered money market funds which are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Other cash equivalent and short-term investments are valued daily by the fund using a market approach with inputs that include quoted market prices for similar instruments. Common and preferred stock equity securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Common/collective/pooled funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their net asset values (NAVs) that are calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Active currency managers, through an overlay program, invest in a broad set of currency derivatives. Derivatives leveled in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued using an income approach with inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates. Exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Private equity valuations are reported by the fund manager and are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. Real estate and real asset fund values are primarily reported by the fund manager and are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. Publicly traded REITs and infrastructure stocks are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Global strategies are primarily limited liability company (LLC) or mutual fund structures. The LLCs are primarily valued using a market approach based on NAVs calculated by the fund and have monthly liquidity. Global strategies mutual funds are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Hedge funds consist of fund-of-fund LLC or commingled fund structures and direct hedge funds. The LLCs are primarily valued using a market approach based on NAVs calculated by the fund and are not publicly available. Liquidity for the LLCs is monthly and is subject to liquidity of the underlying hedge funds. The commingled fund NAV is calculated by the manager on a daily basis and has monthly liquidity. Direct hedge funds are primarily valued by each funds third party administrator based on valuation of the underlying securities and instruments and primarily applying a market or income valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument, equity, fixed income, currency or derivative, held. Direct hedge fund NAVs based on valuation of the underlying holdings are not publicly available and have monthly liquidity. Some of our assets, primarily our private equity, real estate and real assets, hedge funds and global strategies, do not have readily determinable market values given the specific investment structures involved and the nature of the underlying investments. For the December 31, 2012 and 2011 plan asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used where possible. For assets without readily determinable values, estimates were derived from investment manager discussions focusing on underlying fundamentals and significant events. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) we use net asset values, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. The following tables present a reconciliation of Level 3 assets held during the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Transfers into and out of Level 3 are treated as beginning-of-year values. ##TABLE_START  January 1, 2012 Balance  Net Realized and Unrealized Gains/(Losses)  Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements  Net Transfers Into/(Out of) Level 3  December 31, Balance Fixed income securities:          Corporate $11  ($12 )  $11  ($7 )  $3 Mortgage backed and asset backed     Municipal      (3 )   Private equity 2,859   (151 )   2,916 Real estate and real assets          Real estate 1,820     2,128 Real assets     Global strategies    (75 )  Hedge funds 2,451    (1,134 )  1,473 Total $7,777  $519  $310  ($861 )  $7,745 ##TABLE_ENDFor the year ended December 31, 2012 , the change in unrealized gain/(loss) for Level 3 assets still held at December 31, 2012 were ($12) for corporate, $36 for mortgage backed and asset backed, $113 for private equity, $579 for real estate, $62 for real assets and $101 for hedge funds. ##TABLE_START  January 1, 2011 Balance  Net Realized and Unrealized Gains/(Losses)  Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements  Net Transfers Into/(Out of) Level 3  December 31, Balance Fixed income securities:      Corporate $4   $6  $1  $11 Mortgage backed and asset backed  $2  (25 )   Municipal        Private equity 2,626   (94 )    2,859 Real estate and real assets         Real estate 1,428      1,820 Real assets      Global strategies       Hedge funds 1,918  (52 )     2,451 Total $6,468  $529  $778  $2  $7,777 ##TABLE_ENDFor the year ended December 31, 2011 , the change in unrealized gain/(loss) for Level 3 assets still held at December 31, 2011 were $234 for private equity, $205 for real estate, $82 for real assets and ($46) for hedge funds. OPB Plan Assets The majority of OPB plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised of approximately 60% equities and 40% debt securities. The index fund is valued using a market approach based on the quoted market price of an identical instrument (Level 1). The expected rate of return on these assets does not have a material effect on the net periodic benefit cost. Cash Flows Contributions Required pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), as well as rules governing funding of our non-U.S. pension plans, are expected to be minimal in 2013 . We expect to make discretionary contributions to our pension plans of approximately $1,500 in 2013 . We expect to contribute approximately $13 to our OPB plans in 2013 . Estimated Future Benefit Payments The table below reflects the total pension benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants share of the cost, which is funded by participants contributions. OPB payments reflect our portion only. ##TABLE_START Year(s)      20182022 Pensions $2,968  $3,132  $3,309  $3,488  $3,621  $20,421 Other postretirement benefits:            Gross benefits paid      3,386 Medicare Part D and other subsidies (46 )  (47 )  (49 )  (49 )  (51 )  (258 ) Net other postretirement benefits $450  $472  $494  $523  $548  $3,128 ##TABLE_ENDTermination Provisions Certain of the pension plans provide that, in the event there is a change in control of the Company which is not approved by the Board of Directors and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required by ERISA, and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits in our group insurance benefit programs. We have an agreement with the U.S. government with respect to certain pension plans. Under the agreement, should we terminate any of the plans under conditions in which the plans assets exceed that plans obligations, the U.S. government will be entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plans assets based on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts. Defined Contribution Plans We provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expense for these defined contribution plans was $708 , $658 and $614 in 2012, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Note 16  Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements Share-Based Compensation Our 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated effective February 21, 2011, permits awards of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, stock units, performance shares, performance units and other incentives to our employees, officers, consultants and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock available for issuance under the amended plan will not exceed 80,000,000 and no more than an aggregate of 16,000,000 shares are available for issuance as restricted stock awards. Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to meet any requirements to issue shares during 2013 . Share-based plans expense is primarily included in General and administrative expense since it is incentive compensation issued primarily to our executives. The share-based plans expense and related income tax benefit were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Stock options $85  $88  $96 Restricted stock units and other awards   ShareValue Trust     Share-based plans expense $193  $186  $215 Income tax benefit $75  $73  $83 ##TABLE_ENDStock Options In February 2012, 2011 and 2010 , we granted to our executives 6,114,922 , 5,426,910 and 5,932,806 options, respectively. The options have been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. The stock options granted after 2005 vest over a period of three years, with 34% vesting after the first year, 33% vesting after the second year and the remaining 33% vesting after the third year. If an executive terminates employment for any reason, the non-vested portion of the stock option will not vest and all rights to the non-vested portion will terminate completely. Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2012 is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Shares  Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share  Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years)  Aggregate Intrinsic Value Number of shares under option:        Outstanding at beginning of year 31,431,395  $68.52     Granted 6,257,436  75.35     Exercised (2,801,568)  43.00     Forfeited (1,097,393)  71.49     Expired (125,852)  70.74     Outstanding at end of year 33,664,018  $71.81  6.28  $232 Exercisable at end of year 23,121,336  $71.55  5.18  $200 ##TABLE_ENDThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was $89 , $67 and $59 during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Cash received from options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $120 , $114 and $87 with a related tax benefit of $29 , $23 and $20 , respectively, derived from the compensation deductions resulting from these option exercises. At December 31, 2012 , there was $94 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to our stock option plan which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. The grant date fair value of stock options vested during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $83 , $92 and $103 , respectively. The fair values of options were estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: ##TABLE_START Grant Year Grant Date  Expected Life  Expected Volatility  Expected Dividend Yield  Risk Free Interest Rate  Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share 2/27/2012  6 years  29.9 %  2.4 %  1.1 %  $16.89 2/22/2011  6 years  29.8 %  2.3 %  2.5 %  $17.96 2/22/2010  6 years  31.5 %  3.0 %  2.9 %  $15.70 ##TABLE_ENDThe expected volatility of the stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock volatility and the volatility levels implied on the grant date by actively traded option contracts on our common stock. We determined the expected term of the stock option grants to be six years, calculated using the simplified method in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 110. We use the simplified method since we changed the vesting terms, tax treatment and the recipients of our stock options beginning in 2006 such that we believe our historical data no longer provides a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term and we do not have enough option exercise data from our grants issued subsequent to 2006 to support our own estimate. Restricted Stock Units In February 2012, 2011 and 2010 , we granted to our executives 1,369,810 , 1,364,440 and 1,459,256 restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of $75.40 , $71.44 and $63.83 per share, respectively. The RSUs granted under this program will vest and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will immediately vest on a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate completely. In addition to RSUs awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant RSUs to certain executives and employees to encourage retention or to reward various achievements. These RSUs are labeled other restricted stock units in the table below. The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average stock price on the date of grant. Stock units settle in common stock on a one-for-one basis and are not contingent upon stock price. Stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2012 is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Incentive Program Restricted Stock Units  Other Restricted Stock Units Number of units:    Outstanding at beginning of year 4,687,234  1,494,168 Granted 1,402,642  357,006 Dividends 100,269  31,576 Forfeited (230,338 )  (84,578 ) Distributed (2,062,358 )  (546,983 ) Outstanding at end of year 3,897,449  1,251,189 Unrecognized compensation cost $101  $29 Weighted average remaining contractual life (years) 1.8  2.7 ##TABLE_ENDOther Compensation Arrangements Performance Awards Performance Awards are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a three-year period. Each unit has an initial value of $100 dollars per unit. The amount payable at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars per unit, depending on the Companys performance against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to pay these awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on the estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period. During 2012, 2011 and 2010 , we granted Performance Awards to our executives with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals for each three -year period following the grant date. The minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out for the 2012, 2011 and 2010 Performance Awards is $270 , $253 and $241 , respectively. The 2010 grant is expected to be paid out in cash in March 2013 . Deferred Compensation The Company has a deferred compensation plan which permits executives to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus, and certain other incentive awards. Participants can diversify deferred compensation among 23 investment funds including a Boeing stock unit account. Total expense related to deferred compensation was $75 , $59 and $112 in 2012, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the deferred compensation liability which is being marked to market was $1,104 and $1,093 . ShareValue Trust The ShareValue Trust, established July 1, 1996, was a 14-year irrevocable trust that held shares of our common stock, received dividends, and distributed to employees the appreciation in value above a 3% per annum threshold rate of return at the end of each period. The trust was terminated effective July 1, 2010 with the 29,948,920 undistributed shares returned to the Company. Note 17  Shareholders Equity On October 29, 2007, the Board approved the repurchase of up to $7,000 of common stock (the Program). Unless terminated earlier by a Board resolution, the Program will expire when we have used all authorized funds for repurchase. At December 31, 2012 , $3,610 in shares may still be purchased under the Program. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , there were 1,200,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. No preferred stock has been issued. Changes in Share Balances The following table shows changes in each class of shares: ##TABLE_START  Common Stock  Treasury Stock  ShareValue Trust Balance January 1, 2010 1,012,261,159  256,406,709  29,563,324 Issued   (9,851,420 )   Acquired   497,850  385,596 ShareValue Trust termination   29,948,920  (29,948,920 ) Balance at December 31, 2010 1,012,261,159  277,002,059   Issued   (9,800,174 )   Acquired   354,503   Balance at December 31, 2011 1,012,261,159  267,556,388   Issued   (11,935,423 )   Acquired   1,009,663   Balance at December 31, 2012 1,012,261,159  256,630,628   ##TABLE_ENDAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The components of Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Pension and postretirement adjustments ($17,708 )  ($16,755 ) Unrealized gains on derivative instruments, net of reclassification adjustments  Unrealized losses on certain investments, net of reclassification adjustments (8 )  (8 ) Foreign currency translation adjustments  Accumulated other comprehensive loss ($17,416 )  ($16,500 ) ##TABLE_ENDNote 18  Derivative Financial Instruments Cash Flow Hedges Our cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, commodity swaps, and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage currency risk associated with certain transactions, specifically forecasted sales and purchases made in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency contracts hedge forecasted transactions principally occurring within five years in the future, with certain contracts hedging transactions up to 2021 . We use commodity derivatives, such as swaps and fixed-price purchase commitments to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. These include commitments to purchase electricity at fixed prices through 2016 . Fair Value Hedges Interest rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt. The net change in fair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in BCC interest expense. Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment We also hold certain derivative instruments, primarily foreign currency forward contracts, for risk management purposes that are not receiving hedge accounting treatment. Notional Amounts and Fair Values The notional amounts and fair values of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START Notional amounts (1) Other assets Accrued liabilities  2012  2012  Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:          Foreign exchange contracts $2,310  $2,536 $202  $185 ($16 )  ($33 ) Interest rate contracts  26    Commodity contracts    (71 )  (112 ) Derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment:          Foreign exchange contracts  3  (42 )  (47 ) Commodity contracts     (8 )   Total derivatives $3,224  $3,631 $231  $216 ($137 )  ($192 ) Netting arrangements    (53 )  (61 )  Net recorded balance    $178  $155 ($84 )  ($131 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Notional amounts represent the gross contract/notional amount of the derivatives outstanding. ##TABLE_END Gains/(losses) associated with our cash flow and undesignated hedging transactions and their effect on Other comprehensive loss and Net earnings were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  Effective portion recognized in other comprehensive loss, net of taxes:    Foreign exchange contracts $35  $12 Commodity contracts (10 )  (25 ) Effective portion reclassified out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings, net of taxes:    Foreign exchange contracts  Commodity contracts (30 )  (26 ) Forward points recognized in Other income/(expense), net:    Foreign exchange contracts  Undesignated derivatives recognized in Other income/(expense), net:    Foreign exchange contracts (16 )  (21 ) ##TABLE_ENDBased on our portfolio of cash flow hedges, we expect to reclassify gains of $45 (pre-tax) out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings during the next 12 months. Ineffectiveness related to our hedges recognized in Other income/(expense) was insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 . We have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. For foreign exchange contracts with original maturities of at least five years, our derivative counterparties could require settlement if we default on our five-year credit facility. For commodity contracts, our counterparties could require collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and commodity contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at December 31, 2012 was $9 . At December 31, 2012 , there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives. Note 19  Significant Group Concentrations of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments involving potential credit risk are predominantly with commercial aircraft customers and the U.S. government. Of the $10,170 in gross accounts receivable and gross customer financing included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2012 , $4,921 related predominantly to commercial aircraft customers ( $803 of accounts receivable and $4,118 of customer financing) and $2,788 related to the U.S. government. Of the $4,480 in gross customer financing, $2,827 related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit including American Airlines, United/Continental Airlines, and Hawaiian Airlines who were associated with 12% , 9% and 8% , respectively, of our financing portfolio. Financing for aircraft is collateralized by security in the related asset and in some instances security in other assets as well. BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work. BDS fixed-price contracts with significant development work include Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEWC), Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals ( FAB-T ), India P-8I, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker and commercial and military satellites. The operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost and revenue estimates could also result in lower margins or a material charge for reach-forward losses in 2013. 747 and 787 Commercial Airplane Programs The development and initial production of new commercial airplanes and new commercial airplane derivatives, which include the 747 and 787, entail significant commitments to customers and suppliers as well as substantial investments in working capital, infrastructure and research and development. The 747 and 787 programs have gross margins that are breakeven or near breakeven at December 31, 2012. Ongoing weakness in the air cargo market and lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger aircraft have resulted in pricing pressures and fewer 747 orders than anticipated in 2012. We have a number of unsold Freighter and Intercontinental production positions beyond 2013. If we are unable to obtain orders for multiple Freighter aircraft in 2013 consistent with our near-term production plans, we may be required to take actions including reducing the number of airplanes produced and/or building airplanes for which we have not received firm orders. If market and production risks cannot be mitigated, the program could face an additional reach-forward loss that may be material. The cumulative impacts of production challenges, change incorporation, schedule delays from prior periods and customer and supplier impacts have created significant pressure on 787 program profitability. If risks related to this program, including risks associated with change incorporation, planned production rate increases, or introducing the 787-9 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions, as well as a reach-forward loss that may be material. See Note 24. Other Risk As of December 31, 2012 , approximately 39% of our total workforce was represented by collective bargaining agreements. Our contract with SPEEA, who represent 13% of our workforce, expired in October, 2012. SPEEA-represented employees continue to work under the terms of that contract. The parties continue contract negotiations and on January 17, 2013, Boeing presented a contract offer to SPEEA. Note 20  Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. ##TABLE_START December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011   Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets         Money market funds $4,534 $4,534   $3,104 $3,104   Available-for-sale investments 6  $3 5  $5 Derivatives  $178   $155  Total assets $4,721 $4,540 $178 $3 $3,269 $3,109 $155 $5          Liabilities         Derivatives ($84 )  ($84 )  ($131 )  ($131 )  Total liabilities ($84 )  ($84 )  ($131 )  ($131 )  ##TABLE_ENDMoney market funds and available-for-sale equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Available-for-sale debt investments are primarily valued using an income approach based on benchmark yields, reported trades and broker/dealer quotes. Derivatives include foreign currency, commodity and interest rate contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve. Certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following table presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended December 31, and the fair value and asset classification of the related assets as of the impairment date: ##TABLE_START  Fair Value  Total Losses  Fair Value  Total Losses Equipment under operating leases  Assets held for sale or re-lease $75  ($55 )  $115  ($64 ) Property, plant and equipment  (21 )   (35 ) Other assets, Acquired intangible assets, Cost investment    (11 ) Total $96  ($76 )  $138  ($110 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of the impaired operating lease equipment is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of third party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades and other market factors. Management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued appropriateness and consistency with market trends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected net sales price for the aircraft. Property, plant and equipment, Other assets, and Acquired intangible assets were valued using an income approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. The cost investment was valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices for related investments. For Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2012, the following table presents the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques and related unobservable inputs of those assets. ##TABLE_START   Fair Value  Valuation Technique(s)  Unobservable Input  Range Median or Average Equipment under operating leases  Assets held for sale or re-lease  $75  Market approach  Aircraft value publications  $69 - $112 (1) Median $87    Aircraft condition adjustments  $(18) - $6 (2) Net $(12) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  The range represents the sum of the highest and lowest values for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, according to the third party aircraft valuation publications that we use in our valuation process. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The negative amount represents the sum for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, of all downward adjustments based on consideration of individual aircraft attributes and condition. The positive amount represents the sum of all such upward adjustments. ##TABLE_END Fair Value Disclosures The fair values and related carrying values of financial instruments that are not required to be remeasured at fair value on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START 2011 Carrying Amount Total Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Carrying Amount Total Fair Value Assets        Accounts receivable, net $5,608 $5,642  $5,642  $5,793 $5,690 Notes receivable, net 632   836 Liabilities        Debt, excluding capital lease obligations (10,231 ) (12,269 )  (12,221 ) ($48 ) (12,136 ) (14,099 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of Accounts receivable is based on current market rates for loans of the same risk and maturities. The fair values of our variable rate notes receivable that reprice frequently approximate their carrying amounts. The fair values of fixed rate notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on current market yields. For our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowing cost derived from dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. The fair value of our debt classified as Level 3 is based on the median of the underlying collateral value as described above. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain. Items not included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, Accounts payable and long-term payables. The carrying values of those items, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . The fair value of assets and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1). Note 21  Legal Proceedings Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts and other matters are pending against us. Potentially material contingencies are discussed below. We are subject to various U.S. government investigations, from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such government disputes and investigations will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, except as set forth below. Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we have disclosed either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made. A-12 Litigation In 1991, the Department of the Navy (the Navy) notified McDonnell Douglas Corporation (now merged into The Boeing Company) and General Dynamics Corporation (together, the Team) that it was terminating for default the Teams contract for development and initial production of the A-12 aircraft. The Team had full responsibility for performance of the contract and both contractors are jointly and severally liable for any potential liabilities resulting from the termination. The Team filed a legal action to contest the Navys default termination, to assert its rights to convert the termination to one for the convenience of the government, and to obtain payment for work done and costs incurred on the A-12 contract but not paid to date. As of December 31, 2012 , inventories included approximately $587 of recorded costs on the A-12 contract, against which we have established a loss provision of $350 . The amount of the provision, which was established in 1990, was based on McDonnell Douglas Corporations belief, supported by an opinion of outside counsel, that the termination for default would be converted to a termination for convenience, and that the best estimate of possible loss on termination for convenience was $350 . On August 31, 2001, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a decision after trial upholding the governments default termination of the A-12 contract. In 2003, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, finding that the trial court had applied the wrong legal standard, vacated the trial courts 2001 decision and ordered the case sent back to the trial court for further proceedings. On May 3, 2007, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a decision upholding the governments default termination of the A-12 contract. We filed a Notice of Appeal on May 4, 2007 with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On June 2, 2009, the Court of Appeals rendered an opinion affirming the trial courts 2007 decision sustaining the governments default termination. On May 23, 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Court of Appeals upholding the default termination, and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals. On July 7, 2011, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the trial court for additional factual determinations. On July 3, 2012, the trial court set a briefing schedule, which, absent extensions, we expect to be completed in March 2013.  On December 29, 2009, the Navy sent letters to the Team requesting payment of $1,352 in unliquidated progress payments, plus applicable interest. On November 15, 2011, the Navy sent a letter confirming that it would not pursue payment from the Team pending all trial court and appellate proceedings adjudicating the issues remanded by the Supreme Court. We believe that the termination for default is contrary to law and fact and that the loss provision established by McDonnell Douglas Corporation in 1990, which was supported by an opinion from outside counsel, continues to provide adequately for the reasonably possible reduction in value of A-12 net contracts in process as of December 31, 2012 . Final resolution of the A-12 litigation will depend on the outcome of further proceedings or possible negotiations with the U.S. government. If after all legal proceedings are concluded, the court determines, contrary to our belief, that a termination for default was appropriate, we could incur an additional loss of up to $275 , consisting principally of $237 of remaining inventory costs. If the courts further hold that a money judgment should be entered against the Team, we could be required to pay the U.S. government up to one-half of the unliquidated progress payments of $1,350 plus statutory interest from February 1991 (currently totaling up to $1,585 ). In that event, our loss would total approximately $1,741 in pre-tax charges. Should, however, the March 31, 1998 judgment of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in favor of the Team be reinstated, we could be entitled to receive payment of approximately $1,187 , including interest from June 26, 1991. Employment, Labor and Benefits Litigation We have been named as a defendant in two pending class action lawsuits filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, each related to the 2005 sale of our former Wichita facility to Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. (Spirit). The first action involves allegations that Spirits hiring decisions following the sale were tainted by age discrimination, violated ERISA, violated our collective bargaining agreements, and constituted retaliation. The case was brought in 2006 as a class action on behalf of individuals not hired by Spirit. The court granted summary judgment in 2010 in favor of Boeing and Spirit on all class action claims, and during the third quarter of 2012 the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the summary judgment. The individual plaintiffs will all have to decide during the first quarter of 2013 whether or not to pursue individual age discrimination claims. The second action, initiated in 2007, alleges collective bargaining agreement breaches and ERISA violations in connection with alleged failures to provide benefits to certain former employees of the Wichita facility. Written discovery closed by joint stipulation of the parties on June 6, 2011. Depositions concluded on August 18, 2011. Briefing of Boeings and Plaintiffs respective summary judgment motions was completed on June 4, 2012. On December 11, 2012 the court denied plaintiffs  motion for summary judgment and granted Boeing  s motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs  claim that amendment of The Boeing Company Employee Retirement Plan violated the IAM collective bargaining agreement, as well as individual ERISA  510 claims for interference with benefits. The court denied Boeing  s motion for all other claims. Spirit has agreed to indemnify Boeing for any and all losses in the first action, with the exception of claims arising from employment actions prior to January 1, 2005. While Spirit has acknowledged a limited indemnification obligation in the second action, we believe that Spirit is obligated to indemnify Boeing for any and all losses in the second action. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters given the current procedural status of the litigation. On October 13, 2006, we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. Plaintiffs, seeking to represent a class of similarly situated participants and beneficiaries in The Boeing Company Voluntary Investment Plan (the VIP), alleged that fees and expenses incurred by the VIP were and are unreasonable and excessive, not incurred solely for the benefit of the VIP and its participants, and were undisclosed to participants. The plaintiffs further alleged that defendants breached their fiduciary duties in violation of 502(a)(2) of ERISA, and sought injunctive and equitable relief pursuant to 502(a)(3) of ERISA. During the first quarter of 2010, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted a stay of trial proceedings in the district court pending resolution of an appeal made by Boeing in 2008 to the cases class certification order. On January 21, 2011, the Seventh Circuit reversed the district courts class certification order and decertified the class. The Seventh Circuit remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. On March 2, 2011, plaintiffs filed an amended motion for class certification and a supplemental motion on August 7, 2011. Boeings opposition to class certification was filed on September 6, 2011. Plaintiffs reply brief in support of class certification was filed on September 27, 2011. The court has stated its intent to issue rulings on the amended motion for class certification and the alternative motion to proceed as a direct action for breach of fiduciary duty and then stay the case until it is determined if an appeal of the class certification order is filed. As a result, on September 19, 2012 the district court issued an order denying Boeing  s motions for summary judgment as premature pending class determination. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter given the current procedural status of the litigation. Civil Securities Litigation On November 13, 2009, plaintiff shareholders filed a putative securities fraud class action against The Boeing Company and two of our senior executives in federal district court in Chicago. This lawsuit arose from our June 2009 announcement that the first flight of the 787 Dreamliner would be postponed due to a need to reinforce an area within the side-of-body section of the aircraft. Plaintiffs contended that we were aware before June 2009 that the first flight could not take place as scheduled due to issues with the side-of-body section of the aircraft, and that our determination not to announce this delay earlier resulted in an artificial inflation of our stock price for a multi-week period in May and June 2009. On March 7, 2011, the Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice. On March  19, 2012, the Court denied the plaintiffs  request to reconsider that order. On April  12, 2012, plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal, and on April 25, 2012, Boeing filed a Notice of Cross-Appeal based on the district courts failure to award sanctions against the plaintiffs. Oral argument in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals will be held on February 25, 2013. We expect a decision by the end of the second quarter of 2013. In addition, plaintiff shareholders filed three similar shareholder derivative lawsuits concerning the flight schedule for the 787 Dreamliner that closely tracked the allegations in the putative class action lawsuit. Two of the suits were filed in Illinois state court and were consolidated. The remaining derivative suit was filed in federal district court in Chicago. Following the March 2012 decision confirming the dismissal of the class action complaint, the plaintiffs in these derivative lawsuits agreed to voluntarily dismiss their lawsuits without prejudice. Plaintiff in the federal case filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal on June 26, 2012, and the court dismissed the case on June 28, 2012. Plaintiffs in the consolidated state case filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal on July 3, 2012, and the court dismissed the case on August 24, 2012.

During the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded a tax benefit of $397 as a result of settling the 2004-2006 federal audit. Note 24  Subsequent Events A battery-related failure occurred on a 787 aircraft on Jan uary 7, 2013. On January 15, 2013 a second 787 aircraft had a battery incident. On January 16, 2013, the Federal Aviation Administration issued an airworthiness directive to address potential battery risk on the 787 and required U.S. aircraft operators to suspend operations of all 787 aircraft. International government regulators also issued directives to the same effect. We are working with the government regulators and 787 aircraft operators to investigate both incidents. While production continues on the 787, we have suspended deliveries until appropriate clearance is granted by the regulatory agencies. We are unable to reasonably estimate a loss or a range of loss at this time because such estimates are dependent on the ultimate finding as to cause and the timing and conditions surrounding a resolution and return to flight. Any such resolution could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Boeing Company Chicago, Illinois We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2. The financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company retrospectively adopted new accounting guidance related to the presentation of comprehensive income. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 11, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. /S/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois February 11, 2013 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Boeing Company Chicago, Illinois We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 of the Company and our report dated February 11, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Companys retrospective adoption during the year ended December 31, 2012 of new accounting guidance related to the presentation of comprehensive income. /S/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois February 11, 2013 ", "9A": " Item 9A.

Boeing Capital Segment BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Commercial Airplanes customers. In the space and defense markets, BCC primarily arranges and structures financing solutions for our BDS government and commercial satellite customers. BCC s portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases, finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and investments. Financial and Other Business Information See the Summary of Business Segment Data and Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information, including revenues and earnings from operations, for each of our business segments. Intellectual Property We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. Non-U.S. Revenues See Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding non-U.S. revenues. Research and Development Research and development expenditures involve experimentation, design, development and related test activities for defense systems, new and derivative jet aircraft including both commercial and military, advanced space and other company-sponsored product development. These are expensed as incurred including amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on U.S. government contracts. Our total research and development expense amounted to $3.1 billion , $3.3 billion and $3.9 billion in 2013, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Research and development costs also include bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services, as well as costs incurred in excess of amounts estimated to be recoverable under cost-sharing research and development agreements. Bid and proposal costs were $285 million , $326 million and $332 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Employees Total workforce level at December 31, 2013 was approximately 168,400 . As of December 31, 2013 , our principal collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions: ##TABLE_START Union Percent of our Employees Represented Status of the Agreements with the Union The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) 21% We have two major agreements; one expiring in January of 2015 and one in September of 2024. The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) 14% We have one major agreement expiring in October 2016. The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) 2% We have one major agreement expiring in October of 2014 and one in February of 2015. ##TABLE_ENDCompetition The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as Airbus, Embraer and Bombardier, and other entrants from Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with greater value products, services, and support. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which span the life cycle of the airplane: aircraft acquisition, readying for service, maintenance and engineering, enhancing and upgrading, and transitioning to the next model - as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. BDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company and General Dynamics Corporation. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group (formerly European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS)), continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In addition, certain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2014 with many international firms attempting to increase their U.S. presence. Regulatory Matters Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our international markets. Government Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default, based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and can require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default. Commercial Aircraft. In the United States, our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Internationally, similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Joint Aviation Authorities. Environmental. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations. A Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site for which we were originally assigned a partial share, the statutory framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. International. Our international sales are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, investment, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. International sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks. Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take one year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of companies. Suppliers We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and program/contract profitability, thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. We are also dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices. Seasonality No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report. Our Commercial Airplanes business depends heavily on commercial airlines, and is subject to unique risks. Market conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft. The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. In addition, availability of financing to non-U.S. customers depends in part on the Export-Import Bank of the United States, whose current authorization expires at the end of September 2014. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally, or in the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period. We enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. In order to account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by an indexed price escalation formula. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers. Our Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards. The commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers, highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 787-9, 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy regulatory and customer requirements, and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. We must meet planned production rate targets in order to satisfy customer demand and maintain our profitability. We continue to increase production rates for the 737 and 787 programs, while at the same time engaging in significant ongoing development of the 787-9, 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X aircraft. If production rate ramp-up efforts at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the rates necessary to achieve our planned rate increases, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer. Operational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins. Our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory certifications, could result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support costs. Further, if we cannot efficiently and cost-effectively incorporate design changes into already-completed 787 production aircraft, we may face further profitability pressures on this program. If our commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly and technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues. Changes in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the U.S. DoD . Levels of U.S. defense spending in future periods are very difficult to predict and subject to significant risks. In addition, significant budgetary delays and constraints have already resulted in reduced spending levels, and additional reductions may be forthcoming. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act (The Act) established limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending by approximately $490 billion between the 2012 and 2021 U.S. government fiscal years. The Act also provided that the defense budget would face sequestration cuts of up to an additional $500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded. The impact of sequestration cuts was reduced with respect to FY2014 and FY2015 following the enactment of The Bipartisan Budget Act in December 2013. However, significant uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure, including risk of future sequestration cuts. In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies (including NASA) within the overall budgetary framework described above. While the FY2014 appropriations finalized in January 2014 included funding for Boeings major programs, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in FY2015 and beyond will affect Boeings programs. We also expect that ongoing concerns regarding the U.S. national debt will continue to place downward pressure on U.S. DoD spending levels. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. In addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both U.S. defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment, we expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. If we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition priorities and/or fail to meet affordability targets set by the U.S. DoD customer, our revenues and market share would be further impacted. We conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks. In 2013 ,  34% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign military sales through the U.S. government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks. Our sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs. New procurement regulations, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our compliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS business. These requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could be subject to additional costs in the form of withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply with these requirements in the future. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. For example, in 2011, the U.S. Army terminated for convenience the entire BCTM program. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as continuing resolutions rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position. We are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S. government contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, routinely audit government contractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false. We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns. Our BDS business generated approximately 70% of its 2013 revenues from fixed-price contracts. While firm fixed price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance. Fixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include AEWC , India P-8I, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, and commercial and military satellites. We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks. Our BDS business generated approximately 30% of its 2013 revenues from cost-type contracting arrangements. Some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Programs whose contracts are primarily cost-type include GMD , Proprietary and SLS programs. We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks. Contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit payments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite does not perform to specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance. The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees we ultimately expect to realize is recognized as revenue in the construction period. If the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criteria, customers will not be obligated to continue making in-orbit payments and/or we may be required to provide refunds to the customer and incur significant charges. Our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components. We rely on other companies including subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies, and production commodities and to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers or incur additional costs. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum, titanium or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the suppliers control or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs. We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results. Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. With respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling and other non-recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, escalation, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact these estimates. Any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under Managements Discussion and Analysis  Critical Accounting Policies  Contract Accounting/Program Accounting on pages 44  45 and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 55  65 of this Form 10-K. Competition within our markets may reduce our future contracts and sales. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasing competition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers and service providers in one or more of our market segments. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation and new priorities, including long-term cost competitiveness, of our U.S. DoD customer will intensify competition for many of our products and services. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not result in reduced revenues and market share. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries. In 2013 , non-U.S. customers accounted for approximately 57% of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including: ##TABLE_START  changes in regulatory requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  domestic and international government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  fluctuations in international currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  volatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  imposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war and international conflicts. ##TABLE_END While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future. The outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. We are involved in a number of litigation matters. These claims may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S. government, the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our ownership of certain property. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material impact on our financial position and operating results. A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers based in the United States, and in certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks. A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions, particularly in the United States. Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 aircraft. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position could be materially adversely affected. We may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , our airplane financing commitments totaled $17,987 million and $18,083 million . If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures. As part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful. We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures. We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. We maintain insurance for certain risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. government. The amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft technologies, missile systems, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims or liabilities. Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses. Our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. Any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of our data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and of our products and services. Some of our and our suppliers workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages. Approximately 65,000 employees, which constitute 38% of our total workforce, are union represented as of December 31, 2013 . We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BMA program production. We may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 11 U.S. labor organizations and 6 non-U.S. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions requirements without impacting our financial condition. The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations. We have substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders ' equity and cash flows from operations and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods. We have qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover the majority of our employees. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and discretionary contributions to improve the plans ' funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions  could have a significant effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to Shareholders ' equity. For U.S. government contracts, we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. We also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the level of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see  Management ' s Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies - Pension Plans  on page 46 of this Form 10-K. Although GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement benefit contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or past manufacturing operations or the operations of companies we have acquired. In other cases, we may become subject to such costs due to an indemnification agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental liabilities. In addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation requirements could result in additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Unauthorized access to our or our customers information and systems could negatively impact our business. We face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems in order to address these threats. While these measures are designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems, certain types of attacks could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information technology systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we cannot prevent the unauthorized access, release and/or corruption of our customers confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or we could face financial losses.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in many countries and rely on an extensive network of international partners, key suppliers and subcontractors. Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses  Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space  Security (BDS)  supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands and we price our products and services to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. Commercial Airplanes is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security and space to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets often offset. BCC delivers value by supporting our business units and managing overall financing exposure.

The change in unallocated items and eliminations primarily reflects the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries. Revenues in 2012 increased by $12,963 million or 19% compared with 2011. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $12,956 million primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries across all programs. BDS revenues increased by $631 million due to higher revenues in the BMA and GSS segments partially offset by lower revenues in the NSS segment. Unallocated items and eliminations reduced revenues by $610 million in 2012 compared with $82 million in 2011 reflecting higher intercompany deliveries of P-8 and commercial aircraft in 2012. Earnings From Operations The following table summarizes Earnings from operations: (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Commercial Airplanes $5,795  $4,711  $3,495 Defense, Space  Security 3,235  3,068  3,158 Boeing Capital   Other segment (156 )  (186 )  Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense (1,314 )  (899 )  (517 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations (1,105 )  (492 )  (471 ) Earnings from operations (GAAP) $6,562  $6,290  $5,823 Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense 1,314   Core operating earnings (Non-GAAP) $7,876  $7,189  $6,340 ##TABLE_ENDEarnings from operations in 2013  increased by $272 million compared with 2012 . Commercial Airplanes earnings increased by $1,084 million primarily reflecting higher new airplane deliveries and lower research and development expense. BDS earnings increased by $167 million due to higher earnings in the NSS and GSS segments offset by lower earnings in the BMA segment. Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense in 2013 reduced earnings by $415 million compared with 2012 due to higher unallocated pension expense offset by lower unallocated other postretirement expense. Other unallocated items and eliminations in 2013 reduced earnings by $613 million primarily due to a charge recorded in 2013 related to the settlement of A-12 litigation described in Note 20 and higher 2013 deferred compensation expense. Earnings from operations in 2012 increased by $467 million compared with 2011. Commercial Airplanes earnings increased by $1,216 million reflecting higher new airplane deliveries and lower research and development expense partially offset by higher fleet support costs, increased operating costs associated with business growth, other period costs and decreased earnings from commercial aviation services. BDS earnings decreased by $90 million due to lower earnings in the NSS segment, partially offset by higher earnings in the BMA and GSS segments. Other segment losses increased by $225 million primarily due to a reduction in the allowance for losses on receivables in 2011. Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense in 2012 reduced earnings by $382 million compared with 2011 primarily due to higher pension expense. Core operating earnings in 2013  increased by $687 million compared with 2012 as higher earnings at Commercial Airplanes and BDS more than offset the A-12 charge and higher 2013 deferred compensation expense. Core operating earnings in 2012 increased by $849 million compared with 2011 primarily reflecting higher earnings at Commercial Airplanes offset by the impact of the reduction in the allowance for losses on receivables recorded in 2011. Research and Development The following table summarizes our Research and development expense: (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Commercial Airplanes $1,807  $2,049  $2,715 Defense, Space  Security 1,215  1,189  1,138 Other   Total $3,071  $3,298  $3,918 ##TABLE_ENDResearch and development expense in 2013  decreased by $227 million compared to 2012 primarily due to lower spending at Commercial Airplanes on the 787 program partially offset by increased spending on the 737 MAX and 777X. Research and development expense in 2012 decreased by $620 million compared to 2011 primarily due to lower spending at Commercial Airplanes on the 747 and 787 programs. Unallocated Items and Eliminations The most significant items included in Unallocated items and eliminations are shown in the following table: (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Share-based plans ($95 )  ($81 )  ($83 ) Deferred compensation (238 )  (75 )  (61 ) Eliminations and other (366 )  (457 )  (327 ) Litigation settlements (406 )    Sub-total (included in core operating earnings*) (1,105 )  (492 )  (471 ) Pension (1,374 )  (787 )  (269 ) Postretirement  (112 )  (248 ) Pension and other postretirement benefit expense (excluded from core operating earnings*) (1,314 )  (899 )  (517 ) Total ($2,419 )  ($1,391 )  ($988 ) ##TABLE_END* Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense. See page 47 . Deferred compensation expense increased by $163 million in 2013 , primarily driven by increases in our stock price, and by $14 million in 2012, primarily driven by increases in the overall stock market performance. Eliminations and other unallocated expense decreased by $91 million in 2013 , primarily due to the timing of elimination of profit on intercompany items, and increased by $130 million in 2012 due to the timing of intercompany expense allocations and elimination of profit on intercompany items. Litigation settlements include the 2013 charge of $406 million related to the settlement of the A-12 litigation described in Note 20 and the $121 million benefit recorded in 2012 due to a favorable court judgment on satellite litigation. We recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pension and other postretirement benefits of $3,769 million , $3,383 million and $3,127 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The increase in net periodic benefit cost related to pension is primarily due to higher amortization of actuarial losses and higher service costs driven by lower discount rates. Unallocated pension expense in 2013 reflects the pension curtailment charge of $73 million related to the decision in September 2013 to end production of the C-17 aircraft in 2015. See Note 11 . During the third quarter of 2013 we also determined that the pension expense in prior years was overstated and recorded a reduction in pension expense of $63 million. Unallocated other postretirement benefit expense in 2011 includes $161 million of additional expense due to an adjustment primarily related to prior years accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. See the discussion of the postretirement liabilities in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. A portion of net periodic benefit cost is recognized as product costs in Earnings from operations in the period incurred and the remainder is included in inventory at the end of the reporting period and recorded in Earnings from operations in subsequent periods. Costs are allocated to the business segments as described in Note 21 . Net periodic benefit costs included in Earnings from operations were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits Years ended December 31,      Allocated to business segments ($1,662 )  ($1,620 )  ($1,379 )  ($413 )  ($431 )  ($444 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations (1,374 )  (787 )  (269 )   (112 )  (248 ) Total ($3,036 )  ($2,407 )  ($1,648 )  ($353 )  ($543 )  ($692 ) ##TABLE_ENDOther Earnings Items (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Earnings from operations $6,562  $6,290  $5,823 Other income, net   Interest and debt expense (386 )  (442 )  (477 ) Earnings before income taxes 6,232  5,910  5,393 Income tax expense (1,646 )  (2,007 )  (1,382 ) Net earnings from continuing operations $4,586  $3,903  $4,011 ##TABLE_ENDInterest and debt expense decreased by $56 million in 2013 and $35 million in 2012 as a result of lower weighted average debt balances. Our effective income tax rates were 26.4% , 34.0% and 25.6% for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Our 2013 effective tax rate was lower due to research tax credits for the 2013 and 2012 tax years that were both recorded in 2013 and research and experimental regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service in 2013 which resulted in $212 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits being recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our 2011 effective tax rate was lower primarily due to tax benefits of $397 million recorded as a result of federal income tax audit settlements in addition to research tax credits which were not available in 2012. Federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2007. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog Our backlog at December 31 was as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)   Contractual Backlog:      Commercial Airplanes $372,980  $317,287  $293,303 Defense, Space  Security:      Boeing Military Aircraft 24,825  29,226  23,629 Network  Space Systems 9,832  10,078  9,429 Global Services  Support 15,024  15,764  13,296 Total Defense, Space  Security 49,681  55,068  46,354 Total contractual backlog $422,661  $372,355  $339,657 Unobligated backlog $18,267  $17,873  $15,775 ##TABLE_ENDContractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog during 2013 and 2012 was primarily due to commercial aircraft orders in excess of deliveries partially offset by cancellation of orders. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. Unobligated backlog increased during 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to CH-47 Chinook and V-22 Osprey multi-year contract awards. The increase was partially offset by reclassifications to contractual backlog related to incremental funding for the USAF KC-46A Tanker and F-15 multi-year contracts. The increase in unobligated backlog during 2012 was due to increases at BDS of $2,720 million compared with 2011 primarily due to F-15 orders and the contract award for the Space Launch System program received in 2012. Additional Considerations KC-46A Tanker  In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver 4 next generation aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. This contract is a fixed-price incentive firm contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. Changes to our estimated cost to perform the work could result in a material charge. This contract contains production options. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. For segment reporting purposes, backlog, revenues and costs are recorded in the Commercial Airplanes and BMA segments. Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment Global economic activity and global trade, which are the primary drivers of air travel and air cargo growth, grew below the long-term average for the second year in a row in 2013. Despite this, passenger traffic grew by 5% annually in 2012 and 2013 and is forecast to continue at or near the long-term trend of 5% in 2014. There continues to be significant variation between regions and airline business models, with airlines operating in emerging economies and low-cost-carriers leading growth. In contrast, air cargo traffic declined in 2012 and grew by an estimated 1 to 2% in 2013 with continued improvement projected in 2014. The relative weakness of the air cargo market has impacted near-term demand for new freighter aircraft and fre ighter conversions, and we continue to monitor the impact of this trend on our business. Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also relentlessly focusing on reducing costs by renewing fleets to leverage more fuel efficient airplanes and by employing efficiency generating service offerings in a high-fuel-price environment. Net profits for the global airline industry are estimated to total $13 billion in 2013 compared to $7 billion in 2012. Nonetheless, these profit levels reflect low profit margins for the industry, and risk remains due to ongoing economic and political uncertainty. The long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast is for a long-term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger and cargo traffic, based on a projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long-term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $4.8 trillion market for 35,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, and increased global environmental regulations. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia is enabling low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 14% of Commercial Airplanes contractual backlog, in dollar terms, is with U.S. airlines, including cargo carriers. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft in the market above 90 seats. Many of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including launch aid, which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airplane development activities and enables airplanes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. Changes in value of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies impact competitors revenues and profits. Competitors routinely respond to a relatively weaker U.S. dollar by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer-term competitive posture. If the U.S. dollar strengthens, competitors can use the improved efficiency to fund product development, gain market share through pricing and/or improve earnings. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively.

Revenues in 2012 increased by $12,956 million or 36% compared with 2011 primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries across all programs. Commercial airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START       Total            Cumulative deliveries 4,733  1,482  1,061  1,164    Deliveries (1)     (2)  2012            Cumulative deliveries 4,293  1,458  1,040  1,066    Deliveries (1)     (2)  2011            Cumulative deliveries 3,878  1,427  1,014     Deliveries (1)      ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Includes intercompany deliveries of eight aircraft in 2013, nine in 2012 and seven in 2011. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Includes one aircraft in 2013 and three in 2012 accounted for as revenues by BCA and as operating leases in consolidation. ##TABLE_END Earnings From Operations  Earnings from operations in 2013  increased by $1,084 million or 23% compared with 2012 . Earnings increased by $842 million primarily driven by higher new airplane deliveries and lower research and development cost of $242 million due to lower spending on the 787 program partially offset by higher spending on the 737 MAX and 777X. Operating margins increased from 9.6% in 2012 to 10.9% in 2013 primarily due to higher deliveries and lower research and development cost partially offset by the dilutive impact of 787 deliveries. Earnings from operations in 2012 increased by $1,216 million or 35% compared with 2011. This was primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries, which drove an increase in earnings of $1,292 million, and lower research and development expense of $666 million primarily due to lower spending on the 747-8 and 787-8 programs. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings of $742 million driven by higher fleet support costs, increased operating costs associated with business growth, other period costs and decreased earnings from commercial aviation services. The decrease in operating margins from 9.7% in 2011 to 9.6% in 2012 was primarily due to the dilutive effect of the 787 and 747-8 deliveries. Backlog  Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their Board of Directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers. The increase in contractual backlog during 2013 and 2012 was due to orders in excess of deliveries partially reduced by cancellation of orders and changes in projected revenue escalation. The decrease in unobligated backlog in 2013 was due to the reclassification from unobligated to contractual backlog related to incremental funding of the existing multi-year contract for Commercial Airplanes share of the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a programs life. Estimation of each programs accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. ##TABLE_START  Program      2013          Program accounting quantities 7,000  1,574  1,113  1,550  1,300 Undelivered units under firm orders 3,680     Cumulative firm orders 8,413  1,537  1,110  1,544  1,030          Program accounting quantities 6,600  1,574  1,103  1,450  1,100 Undelivered units under firm orders 3,074     Cumulative firm orders 7,367  1,525  1,108  1,431  2011          Program accounting quantities 6,200  1,549  1,084  1,350  1,100 Undelivered units under firm orders 2,365     Cumulative firm orders 6,243  1,524  1,086  1,363  ##TABLE_ENDProgram Highlights 737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 400 units during 2013 due to the program  s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The accounting quantity includes NG and MAX units. We increased our production rate from 35 to 38 per month in the first quarter of 2013 and a further increase to 42 per month is planned for the second quarter of 2014. On October 31, 2013, we announced plans to increase production of the 737 to 47 airplanes per month beginning in 2017. First delivery of the 737 MAX is expected in 2017. 747 Program  Continued weakness in the air cargo market and lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger aircraft have resulted in pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated. We continued to produce at a rate of 2 per month during 2013. In April 2013, we announced that the production rate would be decreased from 2 per month to 1.75 per month starting January 2014 and in October 2013 we announced that we would further reduce the production rate to 1.5 per month from February 2014 through the end of 2015. We continue to have a number of unsold 747 production positions and remain focused on obtaining additional orders, reducing out-of-sequence work, improving supply chain efficiency and implementing cost-reduction efforts. If market and production risks cannot be mitigated, the program could face a reach-forward loss that may be material. 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 10 units during 2013 due to the program  s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. During the third quarter of 2013 we reconfigured the 767 assembly line to include a 767 derivative to support the Tanker program and decreased our production rate from 2 to 1 per month. We expect to increase the commercial rate to 1.5 per month in 2014 and back to 2 per month in 2016. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 100 units during 2013 due to the program  s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We increased our production rate from 7 to 8.3 per month in the first quarter of 2013. In November 2013 we launched the 777X and first delivery is expected in 2020. 787 Program We delivered 65 aircraft in 2013 bringing cumulative deliveries to 114. In January 2013, following battery-related incidents on two 787 aircraft, the Federal Aviation Administration required U.S. aircraft operators to suspend operations of all 787 aircraft. International government regulators also issued directives to the same effect. We continued production but suspended deliveries until appropriate clearances were granted. During the second quarter, we installed a comprehensive set of battery system improvements on 50 previously-delivered 787 airplanes and resumed 787 deliveries to customers. In May 2013, we achieved a production rate of 7 per month in final assembly. We began the production rate increase to 10 per month in final assembly in November 2013 with first deliveries expected to occur at that rate in early 2014. The first 787-9 derivative began final assembly in May 2013 and completed first flight on September 17, 2013. Production and flight testing of the 787-9 continues to be on schedule and we expect the first customer delivery to occur in mid-2014. In June 2013, we announced the launch of the 787-10 derivative aircraft with first delivery targeted for 2018. We continue to incorporate engineering and other design changes identified during 787-8 flight testing into already completed aircraft at our Everett modification center. We also remain focused on stabilizing 787 production rates at 10 per month while continuing to improve aircraft reliability and satisfy customer mission and performance requirements. We continue to monitor and address challenges associated with aircraft production and assembly, including management of ou r manufacturing operations and extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work, as well as the incorporation of the 787-9 derivative into the manufacturing process. In addition, we continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes, including requests for contractual relief related to delivery delays and supplier assertions. During 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipate d due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs associated with these airplanes were included in research and development expense. We have finalized orders for two of the three remaining flight test aircraft. We continue to believe that the remaining 787 flight-test aircraft is commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to that airplane in program inventory. If w e determine that the remaining aircraft cannot be sold, we may incur additional charges related to the reclassification of costs associated with this aircraft to research and development expense. During the third quarter of 2013 we increased the accounting quantity to 1,300 units from 1,100 units to reflect incorporation of revenue and cost estimates associated with the 787-10 and plans to increase production rates to 12 and 14 per month in future years. The accounting quantity of 1,300 units continues to represent approximately 10 years of production at planned production rates. The combination of production challenges, change incorporation, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts has created significant pressure on program profitability. If risks related to this program, including risks associated with planned production rate increases, or introducing the 787-9 and 787-10 derivatives as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions, as well as further pressures on program profitability and/or a reach-forward loss. We continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks. Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. Program Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. We launched the 787-10 in June 2013 and the 777X in November 2013. Additional Considerations The development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 787-9, 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors in aircraft purchase contracts, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for derivative airplanes and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Defense, Space  Security Business Environment and Trends United States Government Defense Environment Overview U.S. government appropriation levels remain subject to significant uncertainty. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act (The Act) established limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending by approximately $490 billion between the 2012 and 2021 U.S. government fiscal years. The Act also provided that the defense budget would face sequestration cuts of up to an additional $500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded. The impact of sequestration cuts was reduced with respect to FY2014 and FY2015 following the enactment of The Bipartisan Budget Act in December 2013. However, significant uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure, including risk of future sequestration cuts. In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) and other government agencies (including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration) within the overall budgetary framework described above. While the FY2014 appropriations finalized in January 2014 included funding for Boeings major programs, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in FY2015 and beyond will affect Boeings programs. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. In addition to the risks described above, if Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner, a government shutdown could result which could have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts or sequestration impacts. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. DoD or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders. International Environment Overview The international market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories, while faced with constrained budgets. In Europe, the continuing financial challenges are forcing governments to institute austerity measures negatively impacting defense spending in the near term. The strongest opportunities for BDS in 2014 will be the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions where the relative financial strength of these economies, coupled with a broad spectrum of evolving threats, will result in procurement of defense and security systems. BDS Realignment Effective January 1, 2013, 2012 and 2011 , certain programs were realigned among BDS segments. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. Operating Results  (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Revenues $33,197  $32,607  $31,976 % of total company revenues %  %  % Earnings from operations $3,235  $3,068  $3,158 Operating margins 9.7 %  9.4 %  9.9 % Contractual backlog $49,681  $55,068  $46,354 Unobligated backlog $17,607  $16,407  $13,687 ##TABLE_ENDSince our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues, earnings and backlog may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Revenues  BDS revenues in 2013  increased by $590 million compared with 2012 due to higher revenues of $601 million and $72 million in the NSS and GSS segments, partially offset by lower revenues of $83 million in the BMA segment. BDS revenues in 2012 increased by $631 million compared with 2011, due to higher revenues of $1,434 million and $250 million in the BMA and GSS segments, partially offset by lower revenues of $1,053 million in the NSS segment. Earnings From Operations  BDS earnings from operations in 2013  increased by $167 million compared with 2012 due to higher earnings of $157 million and $34 million in the NSS and GSS segments, partially offset by lower earnings of $24 million in the BMA segment.  Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $137 million  lower in 2013 compared with 2012 , primarily reflecting lower favorable adjustments in the BMA segment. BDS earnings from operations in 2012 decreased by $90 million compared with 2011 due to lower earnings of $197 million in the NSS segment, partially offset by higher earnings of $58 million and $49 million in the BMA and GSS segments. Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $150 million higher in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily reflecting higher favorable adjustments in the BMA segment. Backlog Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. BDS total backlog was $67,288 million at December 31, 2013 , reflecting a decrease of 6% from December 31, 2012. BDS total backlog increased by 19% in 2012, from $60,041 million to $71,475 million. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional Considerations Our BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense ( GMD ), Proprietary and Space Launch Systems programs. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Airborne Early Warning and Control ( AEWC ), India P-8I, Saudi Arabia F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, and commercial and military satellites.

This reduction was partially offset by an increase of $1,168 million related to higher 2013 deliveries of P-8 aircraft and Apache rotorcraft, as well as non-recurring effort on several Chinook programs. BMA revenues in 2012 increased by $1,434 million or 10% compared with 2011 primarily due to higher deliveries on the P-8A and Apache programs of $1,050 million and higher milestone revenue of $426 million on the KC-46A Tanker program. In addition, F-15 program revenues were $450 million higher reflecting initial revenues on the contract for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia partially offset by lower F-15 deliveries. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $723 million related to fewer deliveries of C-17 aircraft in 2012 and the conclusion of the KC-767 International Tanker program in 2011. Deliveries of units for new-build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   F/A-18 Models   F-15E Eagle   C-17 Globemaster III   CH-47 Chinook   AH-64 Apache   AEWC   P-8 Models   KC-767 International Tanker   Total new-build production aircraft   ##TABLE_ENDEarnings From Operations  BMA earnings from operations in 2013  decreased by $24 million compared with 2012 primarily due to lower earnings on the AEWC and higher 2012 earnings related to the initial revenues on the Saudi F-15 program. The lower earnings were partially offset by higher earnings on the P-8 and Apache program due to increased deliveries and higher revenues. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $146 million  lower in 2013 than in 2012 , primarily driven by less favorable adjustments to the F-15 program and unfavorable adjustments to the AEWC program. In the third quarter of 2013, we decided to end production of C-17 aircraft in 2015. See Note 11 . Also in the third quarter of 2013, we recorded a charge of $64 million to write off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of The Republic of Korea's announcement that it will restart its F-X fighter aircraft competition. BMA earnings from operations in 2012 increased by $58 million compared with 2011 primarily due to higher aircraft deliveries on the P-8A and Apache programs and reach-forward loss provisions in 2011 on the KC-767 International Tanker program. These increases were partially offset by fewer aircraft deliveries on the C-17 program and higher research and development costs. The increase in earnings includes net favorable cumulative catch-up contract adjustments which were $139 million higher in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily reflecting favorable adjustments on the F-15 and Chinook programs. Backlog BMA total backlog was $35,424 million at December 31, 2013 , reflecting a decrease of 8% from December 31, 2012 primarily due to revenues recognized on F-15, F-18 and C-17 program contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by CH-47 Chinook and V-22 Osprey multi-year contract awards. BMA total backlog in 2012 increased by 25% from 2011, primarily due to F-15 and C-17 orders. Additional Considerations C-17 See the discussion of the C-17 program in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. KC-46A Tanker See the discussion of the KC-46A Tanker program on page 23 . Network  Space Systems  Operating Results  (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Revenues $8,512  $7,911  $8,964 % of total company revenues %  %  % Earnings from operations $719  $562  $759 Operating margins 8.4 %  7.1 %  8.5 % Contractual backlog $9,832  $10,078  $9,429 Unobligated backlog $6,076  $6,937  $6,437 ##TABLE_ENDRevenues  NSS revenues in 2013  increased by $601 million compared with 2012 primarily due to higher revenue of $364 million on the Space Launch System program awarded in the fourth quarter of 2012 and higher revenues of $329 million in our commercial satellite programs. This increase was partially offset by lower revenues of $196 million on our electronic and information solutions programs. NSS revenues in 2012 decreased by $1,053 million or 12% compared with 2011 primarily due to $835 million of lower revenues on the Brigade Combat Team Modernization ( BCTM ) program, which was terminated for convenience during 2011. In addition, customer funding constraints on the GMD program and conclusion of the Space Shuttle program in 2011 reduced revenues by a total of $251 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher Space  Intelligence Systems revenues of $178 million due to larger volume of deliveries in 2012. Delta launch and new-build satellite deliveries were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Commercial and civil satellites   Military satellites   ##TABLE_ENDEarnings From Operations  NSS earnings from operations in 2013  increased by $157 million or 28% compared with 2012 primarily due to higher revenues and mix in our civil and commercial satellite programs and the Space Launch Systems program. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings from our United Space Alliance (USA) joint venture reflecting a gain of $39 million recorded in the third quarter of 2012 related to the termination and settlement of USA's defined benefit pension plans. The impact of net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments was not significant in 2013. NSS earnings from operations in 2012 decreased by $197 million or 26% compared with 2011 primarily due to lower revenues on the BCTM program and a $42 million charge related to a contract restructure of an electronic and mission system program. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $56 million lower in 2012 than in 2011 primarily reflecting the $42 million charge described above. NSS earnings from operations include equity earnings of $171 million , $180 million and $194 million from the USA joint venture and the United Launch Alliance ( ULA ) joint venture in 2013, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Backlog NSS total backlog was $15,908 million at December 31, 2013 , reflecting a decrease of 7% from December 31, 2012 primarily due to revenues recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by government and commercial satellite contract awards. NSS total backlog increased by 7% in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to the contract award for the Space Launch System program, partially offset by current year deliveries and sales on contracts awarded in prior years. Additional Considerations United Launch Alliance See the discussion of Indemnifications to ULA and Financing Commitments in Notes 6 , 11 , and 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Sea Launch See the discussion of the Sea Launch receivables in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. LightSquared See the discussion of the LightSquared, LLC receivables in Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Global Services  Support  Operating Results  (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Revenues $8,749  $8,677  $8,427 % of total company revenues %  %  % Earnings from operations $1,051  $1,017  $968 Operating margins 12.0 %  11.7 %  11.5 % Contractual backlog $15,024  $15,764  $13,296 Unobligated backlog $932  $200  $104 ##TABLE_ENDRevenues  GSS revenues in 2013  increased by $72 million compared with 2012 primarily due to higher revenues on several Maintenance, Modification and Upgrade (MMU) and Training Systems  Government Services (TSGS) programs, partially offset by decreases in several Integrated Logistics (IL) programs. GSS revenues in 2012 increased by $250 million compared with 2011 primarily due to higher volume in several IL programs, including contracts to support Chinook and C-17 aircraft, and higher TSGS revenues primarily related to the P-8A program. Earnings From Operations  GSS earnings from operations in 2013  increased by $34 million compared with 2012 primarily due to higher revenues and improved performance on several TSGS programs. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2013 were largely unchanged from 2012. GSS earnings from operations in 2012 increased by $49 million compared to 2011 primarily due to improved performance on several MMU programs and higher revenues on several IL programs. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $67 million higher in 2012 than in 2011. Backlog GSS total backlog was $15,956 million at December 31, 2013 , which was largely unchanged from December 31, 2012 . GSS total backlog increased by 19% in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to the award of F-15 support contracts. Boeing Capital On January 23, 2013, BCC terminated its debt registration statement and on February 22, 2013 BCC suspended its separate U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reporting obligations. This change does not affect operations or customer interactions. On January 23, 2013, Boeing issued full and unconditional guarantees of all of the outstanding publicly-issued debt securities of BCC . Funding requirements will be provided to BCC through intercompany loans from Boeing and we will continue to target a BCC debt-to-equity ratio of 5.0-to-1. As described in Note 13 , on May 3, 2013, Boeing issued $500 million of notes and entered into a concurrent intercompany loan with BCC on the same terms. Interest expense associated with these notes is included in Boeing Capital interest expense. Effective January 1, 2013, BCC 's accounting for certain leasing transactions was aligned with Boeing. Segment information previously reported has been adjusted to reflect this change. Business Environment and Trends BCCs gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2013 totaled $3,921 million . A substantial portion of BCCs portfolio is concentrated among certain U.S. commercial airline customers. BCCs portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably out-of-production Boeing aircraft such as 717 aircraft. BCC provided customer financing of $220 million and $364 million during 2013 and 2012 . While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2014, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,100 western-built commercial jet aircraft ( 9.2% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2013 , including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 20% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2012 and 2011 , 10% and 9.4% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Revenues $408  $468  $547 Earnings from operations $107  $88  $119 Operating margins %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDRevenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and notes, and other income. BCC s revenues in 2013  decreased by $60 million compared with 2012 primarily due to lower other income and operating lease income. Other income decreased due to lower aircraft return condition payments. BCCs revenues in 2012 decreased $79 million compared with 2011 primarily due to lower operating and finance lease income. Operating lease income decreased as a result of the return of aircraft and lower lease rates on re-leased aircraft. In addition, lower finance lease income reflects the revised contractual terms of BCC  s leases with AirTran Airways Inc. (Airtran), a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest Airlines Co. (Southwest), negotiated in conjunction with receiving a full guarantee from Southwest of those lease payment obligations in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings From Operations  BCCs earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, recovery of losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2013  increased by $ 19 million compared with 2012 primarily due to lower depreciation expense and interest expense offset by lower revenues. Earnings from operations in 2012 decreased by $31 million compared with 2011 primarily due to lower revenues partially offset by lower interest and asset impairment expense. Financial Position The following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Customer financing and investment portfolio, net $3,883  $4,290 Other assets, primarily cash and short-term investments  Total assets $4,388  $4,692     Other liabilities, primarily deferred income taxes $1,296  $1,429 Debt, including intercompany loans 2,577  2,742 Equity  Total liabilities and equity $4,388  $4,692     Debt-to-equity ratio 5.0-to-1  5.3-to-1 ##TABLE_ENDThe customer financing portfolio and debt balances presented above as of December 31, 2012 have been revised from balances previously reported in the BCC 2012 10-K filing to reflect the alignment of BCC's accounting to the consolidated Boeing accounting for certain leasing transactions within the portfolio. BCCs customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2013  decreased from December 31, 2012 primarily due to normal portfolio run-off and asset sales, partially offset by the origination of notes receivable. At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , BCC had $83 million and $354 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease, of which $57 million and $266 million had either executed term sheets with deposits or firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $36 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2014 . These aircraft are being remarketed or the leases are being extended and $11 million of these aircraft were committed at December 31, 2013 . BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in the Other segment, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment. Bankruptcies In 2011, American Airlines, Inc. (American Airlines) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On December 9, 2013, American Airlines emerged from bankruptcy. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the parent of American Airlines merged with US Airways Group, Inc., the parent of US Airways, to form American Airlines Group Inc., and American Airlines assumed all of the BCC financing agreements and underlying leases. At December 31, 2013 , American Airlines accounted for $445 million of our customer financing portfolio, of which $371 million represents collateral for $233 million of non-recourse debt. Restructurings and Restructuring Requests From time to time, certain customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with BCC. During 2013 , BCC did not reach agreement on any restructuring requests that would have a material effect on our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. Other Segment (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Revenues $102  $106  $123 Earnings/(Loss) from operations (156 )  (186 )  ##TABLE_ENDOther segment losses in 2013  decreased by $30 million compared with 2012 primarily related to the insurance recoveries in the third quarter of 2013. Other segment losses in 2012 increased by $225 million compared with 2011 primarily due to a $241 million reduction in the allowance for losses on AirTran receivables in 2011. Lower environmental expense of $82 million in 2012 compared with 2011 was largely offset by higher costs related to BCC guarantees and increases in other costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Summary (Dollars in millions) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Net earnings $4,585  $3,900  $4,018 Non-cash items 2,516  2,728  2,140 Changes in working capital 1,078   (2,135 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 8,179  7,508  4,023 Net cash (used)/provided by investing activities (5,154 )  (3,757 )  2,369 Net cash used by financing activities (4,249 )  (3,477 )  (1,700 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (29 )   (2 ) Net (decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents (1,253 )   4,690 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 10,341  10,049  5,359 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $9,088  $10,341  $10,049 ##TABLE_ENDOperating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $8.2 billion during 2013 , compared with $7.5 billion during 2012 and $4.0 billion in 2011 . The increases of $0.7 billion in 2013 and $3.5 billion in 2012 were primarily due to increased customer receipts reflecting higher delivery and order volumes in 2013 and 2012 . Our investment in gross inventories increased by $5.7 billion in 2013, $6.2 billion in 2012 and $9.8 billion in 2011, driven by continued investment in commercial airplane program inventory, primarily 787 inventory. Advances and progress billings increased by $3.9 billion in 2013, $1.9 billion in 2012 and $5 billion in 2011, primarily due to payments from commercial airplane customers. Discretionary contributions to our pension plans totaled $1.5 billion in 2013 compared with $1.6 billion in 2012 and $0.5 billion in 2011 . Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities totaled $5.2 billion during 2013 compared with $3.8 billion used during 2012 and $2.4 billion provided during 2011 , largely due to higher net contributions to investments in time deposits. Net contributions to investments were $2.9 billion in 2013 compared with $2 billion in 2012 and net proceeds from investments of $4 billion in 2011. In 2013 , capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion , up from $1.7 billion in the prior two years. We expect capital expenditures to remain higher in 2014 due to continued investment to support growth. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $4.2 billion during 2013 , an increase of $0.8 billion compared with 2012 primarily due to share repurchases of $2.8 billion in 2013 partially offset by higher new borrowings of $0.5 billion , lower debt repayments of $0.6 billion and an increase in stock options exercised of $1 billion in the current year. Cash used by financing activities was $3.5 billion during 2012 , an increase of $1.8 billion compared with 2011 as a result of higher debt repayments of $1.1 billion and lower new borrowings of $0.7 billion . In 2013, we issued notes totaling $0.5 billion to fund the BCC segment and repaid $1.4 billion of debt, including repayments of $0.6 billion of debt held at BCC. At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the recorded balance of debt was $9.6 billion and $10.4 billion , of which $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion were classified as short-term. This includes $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion of debt attributable to BCC, of which $0.7 billion was classified as short-term in both periods. During 2013 , we repurchased 25.4 million shares totaling $2.8 billion through our open market share repurchase program. There were no shares repurchased through the share repurchase program in 2012 and 2011. In 2013 and 2012 , we had 0.8 million and 1 million shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that continues to serve as a significant potential source of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2013 and at December 31, 2013 , we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $4.8 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. Financing commitments totaled $18 billion and $18.1 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012 . We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities. At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , our pension plans were $10.5 billion and $19.7 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2013 with minimal required contributions in 2014 . We expect to make discretionary contributions to our plans of approximately $750 million in 2014 . We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years. At December 31, 2013 , we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2013 , and the estimated timing thereof. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Total  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  3-5 years  After 5 years Long-term debt (including current portion) $9,517  $1,490  $1,893  $682  $5,452 Interest on debt (1) 6,484     4,276 Pension and other postretirement cash requirements 15,329   3,005  6,803  4,944 Capital lease obligations     Operating lease obligations 1,414     Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position 123,904  46,938  41,985  19,344  15,637 Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position 15,849  15,191    Total contractual obligations $172,653  $64,998  $48,823  $27,873  $30,959 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2013 . Variable rate debt was less than 2% of our total debt at December 31, 2013 . ##TABLE_END Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Approximately 4% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts. Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation. Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2013 , we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2013 , we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $18.4 billion that extend through 2030 . Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Income Tax Obligations As of December 31, 2013 , our net asset for income taxes receivable, including uncertain tax positions, was $24 million . We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. Our income tax matters are excluded from the table above. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2013 . ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Total Amounts Committed/Maximum Amount of Loss  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  4-5 years  After 5 years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $4,376  $2,525  $1,720  $83  $48 Commercial aircraft financing commitments 17,987  2,309  6,171  4,956  4,551 Total commercial commitments $22,363  $4,834  $7,891  $5,039  $4,599 ##TABLE_ENDCommercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contingent Obligations We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, including certain employment, labor and benefits litigation. Note 20 also addresses the settlement of the A-12 aircraft litigation. Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $649 million at December 31, 2013 . For additional information, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We have recorded a liability of $1,141 million at December 31, 2013 for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-GAAP Measures Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the impact of unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expenses which represent costs not attributable to business segments - see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts. Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures The table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of earnings from operations, operating margins and diluted earnings per share. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except per share data)      Revenues $86,623  $81,698  $68,735 Earnings from operations, as reported $6,562  $6,290  $5,823 Operating margins 7.6 %  7.7 %  8.5 %       Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense $1,314  $899  $517 Core operating earnings (non-GAAP) $7,876  $7,189  $6,340 Core operating margins (non-GAAP) 9.1 %  8.8 %  9.2 %       Diluted earnings per share, as reported $5.96  $5.11  $5.34 Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense (1) $1.11  $0.77  $0.45 Core earnings per share (non-GAAP) $7.07  $5.88  $5.79 Weighted average diluted shares (in millions) 769.5  763.8  753.1 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Earnings per share impact is presented net of the federal statutory rate of 35.0%. ##TABLE_END Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting We use contract accounting to determine revenue, cost of sales, and profit for almost all of our BDS business. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contracts inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ending December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 net cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all BDS contracts increased operating earnings by $242 million , $379 million and $229 million , respectively. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS for all of 2013 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $332 million . In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower margins than established programs. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or other circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs for all of 2013 had been estimated to be lower by 1%, it would have increased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $460 million . If the combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs for all of 2013 (excluding the 747 and 787 programs which had gross margins that were breakeven or near breakeven during 2013 ) had been estimated to be higher by 1%, it would have decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $354 million . If we are unable to mitigate risks associated with the 747 and 787 programs, or if we are required to change one or more of our pricing, cost or other assumptions related to these programs, we could be required to record reach forward losses which could have a material effect on our reported results. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any. We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2013 and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2013, we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had $497 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would reduce the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets by less than $1 million . Pension Plans The majority of our employees are earning benefits under defined benefit pension plans. All nonunion and some union employees hired after December 31, 2008 are not covered by defined benefit plans. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders equity. The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2013 . ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Change in discount rate Increase 25 bps  Change in discount rate Decrease 25 bps Pension plans    Projected benefit obligation ($2,043 )  $2,543 Net periodic pension cost (227 )  ##TABLE_ENDPension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2013 net periodic pension expense by $131 million . We expect 2014 net periodic pension cost to decrease by approximately $1,400 million and the portion recognized in earnings for 2014 to increase by approximately $100 million primarily due to amortization of actuarial losses. ", "7A": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2013 , the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2013 , a 10% increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized gains by $244 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our unrealized gains by $244 million . Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. ", "8": " Item 8.

The Boeing Company and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011  (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as Boeing, the Company, we, us, or our). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Amounts reported in prior periods as Interest and debt expense have been reclassified to Boeing Capital interest expense to conform to the current year presentation. Use of Estimates Management makes assumptions and estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Those assumptions and estimates directly affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant estimates for which changes in the near term are considered reasonably possible and that may have a material impact on the financial statements are disclosed in these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Cycle For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year . Revenue and Related Cost Recognition Contract Accounting Contract accounting is used for development and production activities predominantly by Defense, Space  Security (BDS). The majority of business conducted by BDS is performed under contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that extend over several years. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales and costs for each contract resulting in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. When the current estimates of total sales and costs for a contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contracts percent complete. In 2013 , 2012 and 2011 net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments increased Earnings from operations by $242 , $379 and $229 , respectively and diluted EPS by $0.23 , $0.33 and $0.23 , respectively. We combine contracts for accounting purposes when they are negotiated as a package with an overall profit margin objective. These essentially represent an agreement to do a single project for a single customer, involve interrelated construction activities with substantial common costs, and are performed concurrently or sequentially. When a group of contracts is combined, revenue and profit are earned uniformly over the performance of the combined contracts. Similarly, we may segment a single contract or group of contracts when a clear economic decision has been made during contract negotiations that would produce different rates of profitability for each element or phase of the contract. Sales related to fixed-price contracts are recognized as deliveries are made, except for certain fixed-price contracts that require substantial performance over an extended period before deliveries begin, for which sales are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones. Sales related to contracts in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if specified targets are achieved. Incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated and are probable are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded. Program Accounting Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales related to its programs. Program accounting is applicable to products manufactured for delivery under production-type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contracts and years. Under program accounting, inventoriable production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced, and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. We recognize sales for commercial airplane deliveries as each unit is completed and accepted by the customer. Sales recognized represent the price negotiated with the customer, adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. The amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effects on program margins are recognized prospectively except in cases where the program is determined to have a reach-forward loss in which case the loss is recognized in the current period. See Note 11 . Concession Sharing Arrangements We account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their purchase of products and services as a reduction to revenue when the related products and services are delivered. The sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendors products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products. Spare Parts Revenue We recognize sales of spare parts upon delivery and the amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost. Service Revenue Service revenue is recognized when the service is performed with the exception of U.S. government service agreements, which are accounted for using contract accounting. Service activities primarily include: support agreements associated with military aircraft and helicopter contracts, ongoing maintenance of International Space Station, and technical and flight operation services for commercial aircraft. Service revenue and associated cost of sales from pay-in-advance subscription fees are deferred and recognized as services are rendered. Financial Services Revenue We record financial services revenue associated with sales-type/finance leases, operating leases, and notes receivable. Lease and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type/finance leases, we record an asset at lease inception. This asset is recorded at the aggregate future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur. For operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets, included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated residual value, using the straight-line method. We periodically review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense. For notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note. Reinsurance Revenue Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Astro Ltd., participates in a reinsurance pool for workers compensation. The member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $160 , $129 and $144 during 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were $147 , $128 and $142 during 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Revenues and costs are presented net in Cost of services in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fleet Support We provide assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation to the operators of all our commercial airplane models. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, and technical consulting support. This activity continues throughout the aircrafts operational life. Services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire models fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services. Research and Development Research and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design, and testing, as well as bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers. Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with our contract accounting policy. We have certain research and development arrangements that meet the requirement for best efforts research and development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expense rather than as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of $285 , $326 and $332 in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. We have established cost sharing arrangements with some suppliers for the 787 program. Our cost sharing arrangements state that the supplier contributions are for reimbursements of costs we incur for experimentation, basic design, and testing activities during the 787 development. In each arrangement, we retain substantial rights to the 787 part or component covered by the arrangement. The amounts received from these cost sharing arrangements are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses since we have no obligation to refund any amounts received per the arrangements regardless of the outcome of the development efforts. Specifically, under the terms of each agreement, payments received from suppliers for their share of the costs are typically based on milestones and are recognized as earned when we achieve the milestone events and no ongoing obligation on our part exists. In the event we receive a milestone payment prior to the completion of the milestone, the amount is classified in Accrued liabilities until earned. Share-Based Compensation We provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value net of estimated forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. Income Taxes Provisions for federal, state, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Earnings before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. Tax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of Income tax expense. Postretirement Plans The majority of our employees are earning benefits under defined benefit pension plans. All nonunion and some union employees hired after December 31, 2008 are not covered by defined benefit plans. We also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employees annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). A portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and reflected in inventory at the end of a reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in Shareholders equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities we amortize them over the average future service period of employees. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Postemployment Plans We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated. Environmental Remediation We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations, and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup, and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be able to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable were $108 and $159 at December 31, 2013 and 2012 . Inventories Inventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe benefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries and plant services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costs include amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one year. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering. Commercial aircraft programs inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production costs represent actual costs incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costs are experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor and other resources) than units produced later in a program because of volume efficiencies and the effects of learning. We expect that these deferred costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive from suppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier advances are amortized to work in process. The determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision is recorded. The determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimate revenue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity. When estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. Used aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value. See Aircraft Valuation within this Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or market. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired inventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs. Included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the ability to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwise recoverable, it would be written off in the current period. We net advances and progress billings on long-term contracts against inventory in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Advances and progress billings in excess of related inventory are reported in Advances and billings in excess of related costs. Precontract Costs We may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recovery from future orders, then we capitalize the precontract costs we incur, excluding start-up costs which are expensed as incurred. Capitalized precontract costs are included in Inventories, net of advances and progress billings, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Should future orders not materialize or we determine the costs are no longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and equipment, from 3 to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over 5 years. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition. Long-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Long-lived assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Asset Retirement Obligations We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material. We also have known conditional asset retirement obligations, such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liabilitys fair value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1. We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology, from 6 to 14 years; product know-how, from 5 to 30 years; customer base, from 5 to 19 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 30 years; and other, from 5 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Investments Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost. The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between 20% and 50% . We classify investment income and loss on our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on whether the investment is operating or non-operating in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, including our share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from certain cost method investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic purposes. Earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on marketable securities, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in Other income/(expense), net. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them. We use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes in fair value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is to include in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For our cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss of a cash flow hedge is reported in earnings immediately. We also hold certain instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For these derivative instruments, the changes in their fair value are also recorded in earnings immediately. Aircraft Valuation Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments. Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of: ##TABLE_START (1) adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recognized upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) charges to cost of products for adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in Accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_END The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customers requirements; or the scrap market. Trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market. This quarterly valuation process yields results that are typically lower than residual value estimates by independent sources and tends to more accurately reflect results upon the actual placement of the aircraft. Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or market as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer financing. Customer financing Customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/finance leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary. We assess the fair value of the assets we own, including equipment under operating leases, assets held for sale or re-lease, and collateral underlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are less than the related assets carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fair values of sales-type/finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables. We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications. Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Allowance for losses on customer financing receivables We record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in a valuation account, the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to two components of receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables. We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the receivable agreement, without regard to any subsequent restructurings. Factors considered in assessing collectibility include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. We determine a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral we would expect to realize. We review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables (after excluding receivables subject to a specific impairment allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for each customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, for example, permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall. Each quarter we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables. Warranties In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material and design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a three to four -year standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards under our authorization. These warranties are included in the programs estimate at completion. On occasion we have made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warranties issued by our BDS segments principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons hardware and are included in the contract cost estimates. These sales are generally accompanied by a six to twelve -month warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate. We provide guarantees to certain commercial airplane customers which include compensation provisions for failure to meet specified aircraft performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets, and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of the related aircraft. We have agreements that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to customers for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as a reduction in Cost of products at delivery of the related aircraft. These performance warranties and claims against suppliers are included in the programs estimate at completion. Supplier Penalties We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully anticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts. Guarantees We record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. For a residual value guarantee where we received a cash premium, the liability is equal to the cash premium received at the guarantees inception. For credit guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditors default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable, for each future period the credit guarantee will be outstanding. If at inception of a guarantee, we determine there is a probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value of the guarantee as described above or (b) the probable contingent loss amount. Note 2  Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Commercial Airplanes  Boeing Military Aircraft  Network  Space Systems  Global Services  Support  Total Balance at January 1, 2011 $2,110  $1,041  $1,461  $325  $4,937 Acquisitions      Goodwill adjustments (4 )    (4 )   (8 ) Balance at December 31, 2011 $2,106  $1,041  $1,473  $325  $4,945 Acquisitions      Goodwill adjustments    (1 )    Balance at December 31, 2012 $2,125  $1,041  $1,472  $397  $5,035 Acquisitions    Goodwill adjustments (1) (17 ) (45 ) 4  (17 ) Balance at December 31, 2013 $2,108  $1,014 $1,513 $408 $5,043 ##TABLE_END(1) Includes adjustments to realign certain programs among BDS segments effective January 1, 2013 , As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had indefinite-lived intangible assets with carrying amounts of $497 relating to trade names. The gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization of our acquired finite-lived intangible assets were as follows at December 31: ##TABLE_START    Gross Carrying Amount  Accumulated Amortization  Gross Carrying Amount  Accumulated Amortization Distribution rights $2,275  $483  $2,132  $388 Product know-how    Customer base    Developed technology    Other    Total $4,483  $1,928  $4,335  $1,721 ##TABLE_ENDAmortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $205 and $213 . Estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding years is as follows: ##TABLE_START      Estimated amortization expense $219  $214  $199  $193  $186 ##TABLE_ENDDuring 2013 and 2012 we acquired $144 and $277 of finite-lived intangible assets, of which $0 and $213 related to non-cash investing and financing transactions. Total acquired finite-lived intangibles of $182 and $352 remain unpaid as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 . Note 3  Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earnings per share for common shares and participating securities. The undistributed earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed earnings. Basic earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. The elements used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows: (In millions - except per share amounts) ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Net earnings $4,585  $3,900  $4,018 Less: earnings available to participating securities   Net earnings available to common shareholders $4,578  $3,892  $4,009 Basic      Basic weighted average shares outstanding 760.8  758.0  746.6 Less: participating securities 1.9  2.3  2.5 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 758.9  755.7  744.1 Diluted      Basic weighted average shares outstanding 760.8  758.0  746.6 Dilutive potential common shares (1) 8.7  5.8  6.5 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 769.5  763.8  753.1 Less: participating securities 1.9  2.3  2.5 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 767.6  761.5  750.6 Net earnings per share:      Basic $6.03  $5.15  $5.39 Diluted 5.96  5.11  5.34 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Diluted EPS includes any dilutive impact of stock options, restricted stock units and Performance Awards. ##TABLE_END The shares included in the following table were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect was antidilutive.

Our effective income tax rates were 26.4% , 34.0% and 25.6% for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Our 2013 effective tax rate is lower than 2012 primarily due to the inclusion of the U.S. research and development tax credit (research tax credit) in 2013, which was not available in 2012, and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of new regulations described below. In 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 that retroactively renewed the research tax credit for 2012 and extended the credit through December 31, 2013. As tax law changes are recognized in the period in which new legislation is enacted, the 2012 research tax credit of $145 was recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Our 2012 effective tax rate was higher than 2011, primarily due to tax benefits of $397 recorded in 2011 as a result of federal income tax audit settlements in addition to research tax credits which were not available in 2012. The research tax credit expired on December 31, 2013. If the research tax credit is not extended there would be an unfavorable impact to our 2014 effective income tax rate. On September 5, 2013, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued proposed regulations that amend the definition of research and experimental (RE) expenditures. The regulations provided clarity regarding the categories of expense that can be considered when computing the research tax credit. Based upon our analysis of the regulations, $212 of previously unrecognized tax benefits related to research tax credits were recorded as a reduction to tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2013. The following is a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% to our effective income tax rate: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   U.S. federal statutory tax 35.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % Research and development credits (4.9 )  0.8  (2.7 ) Proposed amendments to the RE regulations (3.4 )   Tax on international activities (0.1 )  (1.2 )  (0.6 ) Tax deductible dividends (0.6 )  (0.7 )  (0.8 ) State income tax provision, net of effect on U.S. federal tax 0.4  0.8  0.7 Federal audit settlement   (7.4 ) Other provision adjustments  (0.7 )  1.4 Effective income tax rate 26.4 %  34.0 %  25.6 % ##TABLE_ENDFederal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2007. The years 2009-2010 are currently being examined by the IRS. The matters under consideration by IRS Appeals for tax years 2007-2008 are in the final phase of review with the Joint Committee on Taxation. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2001-2013 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years. Significant components of our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Retiree health care accruals $2,458  $2,867 Inventory and long-term contract methods of income recognition, fixed assets and other (net of valuation allowance of $20 and $27) (9,948 )  (7,151 ) Partnerships and joint ventures (62 )  (162 ) Other employee benefits accruals 1,773  1,427 In-process research and development related to acquisitions  Net operating loss, credit and capital loss carryovers (net of valuation allowance of $105 and $94)  Pension asset 3,099  6,232 Customer and commercial financing (990 )  (1,078 ) Unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries (44 )  (49 ) Other net unrealized losses  (17 ) Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets (1) ($3,303 )  $2,413 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Of the deferred tax asset for net operating loss and credit carryovers, $295 expires in years ending from December 31, 2014 through December 31, 2033 and $67 may be carried over indefinitely. Included in the net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 are deferred tax assets in the amounts of $5,818 and $10,210 related to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. ##TABLE_END Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Deferred tax assets $12,486  $16,580 Deferred tax liabilities (15,664 )  (14,046 ) Valuation allowance (125 )  (121 ) Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets ($3,303 )  $2,413 ##TABLE_ENDThe measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have provided for U.S. deferred income taxes and foreign withholding tax in the amount of $44 on undistributed earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding tax on the remainder of undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries of approximately $775 because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that may be payable upon distribution. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position were as follows: interest of $12 and $11 and penalties of $8 and $11 . The amounts of interest benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were $4 , $43 , and $94 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The interest benefit recorded during 2012 was primarily related to the settlement of non-US audits. The interest benefit recorded during 2011 was primarily related to federal audit settlements. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: ##TABLE_START    Unrecognized tax benefits  January 1 $1,055  $939  $1,198 Gross increases  tax positions in prior periods   Gross decreases  tax positions in prior periods (125 )  (20 )  (383 ) Gross increases  current-period tax positions   Gross decreases  current-period tax positions (1 )  (1 )  (15 ) Settlements  (1 )  (42 ) Lapse of statute of limitations   (1 ) Unrecognized tax benefits  December 31 $1,141  $1,055  $939 ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1,141 , $1,055 , and $939 of which $1,018 , $945 , and $838 would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. As of December 31, 2013 , these amounts are primarily associated with U.S. federal tax issues such as the amount of research tax credits claimed, the domestic production activities deductions claimed and U.S. taxation of foreign earnings. Also included in these amounts are accruals for domestic state tax issues such as the allocation of income among various state tax jurisdictions and the amount of state tax credits claimed. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. It is reasonably p ossible that within the next 12 months we will resolve the matters presently under consideration for the 2007-2010 tax years with the IRS. Depending on the timing and outcome of the audit settlements, unrecognized tax benefits that affect the effective tax rate could increase earnings by up to $245 based on current estimates. Note 5  Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   U.S. government contracts $3,604  $2,788 Defense, Space  Security customers (1) 1,073  1,196 Commercial Airplanes customers 1,072  Reinsurance receivables  Other  Less valuation allowance (104 )  (82 ) Total $6,546  $5,608 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Excludes U.S. government contracts ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes our accounts receivable under long-term contracts that were unbillable or related to outstanding claims as of December 31 : ##TABLE_START  Unbillable  Claims      Current $1,550  $1,316  $3  $26 Expected to be collected after one year 1,020    Total $2,570  $2,046  $64  $89 ##TABLE_ENDUnder contract accounting unbillable receivables on long-term contracts arise when the sales or revenues based on performance attainment, though appropriately recognized, cannot be billed yet under terms of the contract as of the balance sheet date. Any adjustment for the credit quality of unbillable receivables, if required, would be recorded as a direct reduction of revenue. Factors considered in assessing the collectability of unbillable receivables include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. Unbillable receivables related to commercial customers expected to be collected after one year were  $179 and $230 at December 31, 2013 and 2012 . Accounts receivable related to claims are items that we believe are earned, but are subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate realization. Accounts receivable as of December 31, 2013 , included $112 of unbillable receivables on a long-term contract with LightSquared, LLC (LightSquared) related to the construction of two commercial satellites. One of the satellites has been delivered, and the other is substantially complete but remains in Boeings possession. On May 14, 2012, LightSquared filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. We believe that our rights in the second satellite and related ground-segment assets are sufficient to protect the value of our r eceivables in the event LightSquared fails to make payments as contractually required or rejects its contract with us. Given the uncertainties inherent in bankruptcy proceedings, it is reasonably possible that we could incur losses related to these receivables in connection with the LightSquared bankruptcy. Accounts receivable, other than those described above, expected to be collected after one year are not material. Note 6  Inventories Inventories at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Long-term contracts in progress $12,608  $15,130 Commercial aircraft programs 48,065  40,389 Commercial spare parts, used aircraft, general stock materials and other 7,793  7,206 Inventory before advances and progress billings 68,466  62,725 Less advances and progress billings (25,554 )  (24,974 ) Total $42,912  $37,751 ##TABLE_ENDLong-Term Contracts in Progress Long-term contracts in progress includes Delta launch program inventory that is being sold at cost to United Launch Alliance (ULA) under an inventory supply agreement that terminates on March 31, 2021. At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the inventory balance, net of advances, was $425 and $725 . At December 31, 2013 , $346 of this inventory related to unsold launches. See Note 12 . Inventory balances included $0 and $237 subject to claims or other uncertainties relating to the A-12 program at December 31, 2013 and 2012 . See Note 20 . Capitalized precontract costs of $520 and $238 at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , are included in inventories. Commercial Aircraft Programs At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 787 program: $27,576 and $21,289 of work in process (including deferred production costs of $21,620 and $15,929 ), $2,189 and $1,908 of supplier advances, and $3,377 and $2,339 of unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs. At  December 31, 2013 , $16,882 of 787 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and $8,115 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 747 program: $1,554 and $1,292 of deferred production costs, net of previously recorded reach-forward losses, and $563 and $683 of unamortized tooling costs. At December 31, 2013 , $1,163 of 747 deferred production costs and unamortized tooling are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and $954 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. Commercial aircraft programs inventory included amounts credited in cash or other consideration (early issue sales consideration) to airline customers totaling $3,465 and $2,989 at December 31, 2013 and 2012 . Note 7  Customer Financing Customer financing primarily relates to the Boeing Capital (BCC) segment and consisted of the following at December 31: ##TABLE_START   Financing receivables:    Investment in sales-type/finance leases $1,699  $1,850 Notes  Operating lease equipment, at cost, less accumulated depreciation of $564 and $628 1,734  2,038 Gross customer financing 4,020  4,480 Less allowance for losses on receivables (49 )  (60 ) Total $3,971  $4,420 ##TABLE_ENDThe components of investment in sales-type/finance leases at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Minimum lease payments receivable $1,731  $1,987 Estimated residual value of leased assets  Unearned income (575 )  (681 ) Total $1,699  $1,850 ##TABLE_ENDOperating lease equipment primarily includes large commercial jet aircraft and regional jet aircraft. At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , operating lease equipment included $83 and $354 of BCC equipment available for sale or re-lease. At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had firm lease commitments for $57 and $266 of this equipment. Financing receivable balances evaluated for impairment at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Individually evaluated for impairment $95  $616 Collectively evaluated for impairment 2,191  1,826 Total financing receivables $2,286  $2,442 ##TABLE_ENDWe determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms. At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we individually evaluated for impairment customer financing receivables of $95 and $616 . We determined that none of these were impaired at December 31, 2013 and $446 were impaired at December 31, 2012 . We recorded no allowance for losses on these receivables as the collateral values exceed the carrying values of the receivables. The average recorded investment in impaired financing receivables for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 , was $376 , $466 and $517 , respectively. Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Income is recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer. Interest income recognized on such receivables was $30 , $6 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had no material receivables that were greater than 30 days past due. The change in the allowance for losses on financing receivables for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 , consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    Beginning balance - January 1 ($60 )  ($70 )  ($353 ) Customer financing valuation benefit   Write-offs   Ending balance - December 31 ($49 )  ($60 )  ($70 ) Collectively evaluated for impairment ($49 )  ($60 )  ($70 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customer financing receivables are customer credit ratings, default rates and collateral values. We assign internal credit ratings for all customers and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers. Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies. The customer financing valuation benefit recorded in 2011 was primarily driven by changes in the internal credit rating categories assigned to our receivable balances from AirTran Holdings, LLC. Our financing receivable balances at December 31 by internal credit rating category are shown below: ##TABLE_START Rating categories  BBB $1,091  $1,201 BB  B  CCC  D  Other  Total carrying value of financing receivables $2,286  $2,442 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2013 , our allowance primarily related to receivables with ratings of CCC and we applied default rates that averaged 46% to the exposure associated with those receivables. In 2011, American Airlines, Inc. (American Airlines) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On December 9, 2013, American Airlines emerged from bankruptcy. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the parent of American Airlines merged with US Airways Group, Inc., the parent of US Airways, to form American Airlines Group Inc., and American Airlines assumed all of the BCC financing agreements and underlying leases. Customer Financing Exposure Customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance and overall market conditions and may be subject to reduced valuation with market decline. Declines in collateral values are also a significant driver of our allowance for losses. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have experienced greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft. Our customer financing portfolio is primarily collateralized by out-of-production aircraft. The majority of customer financing carrying values are concentrated in the following aircraft models: ##TABLE_START   717 Aircraft ($444 and $465 accounted for as operating leases) (1) $1,674  $1,781 757 Aircraft ($402 and $454 accounted for as operating leases) (1)  MD-80 Aircraft (Accounted for as sales-type finance leases) (1)  747 Aircraft ($183 and $221 accounted for as operating leases)  787 Aircraft (Accounted for as operating leases)  MD-11 Aircraft (Accounted for as operating leases) (1)  737 Aircraft ($138 and $193 accounted for as operating leases)  767 Aircraft ($60 and $63 accounted for as operating leases)  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Out-of-production aircraft ##TABLE_END Charges related to customer financing asset impairment for the years ended December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Boeing Capital $67  $73  $109 Other Boeing  (15 )  (36 ) Total $81  $58  $73 ##TABLE_ENDScheduled receipts on customer financing are as follows: ##TABLE_START Year      Beyond 2018 Principal payments on notes receivable $216  $131  $41  $42  $45  $112 Sales-type/finance lease payments receivable      Operating lease equipment payments receivable      ##TABLE_ENDNote 8  Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Land $562  $531 Buildings and land improvements 11,068  10,696 Machinery and equipment 12,376  11,847 Construction in progress 1,288  1,231 Gross property, plant and equipment 25,294  24,305 Less accumulated depreciation (15,070 )  (14,645 ) Total $10,224  $9,660 ##TABLE_ENDDepreciation expense was $1,338 , $1,248 and $1,119 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Interest capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 totaled $87 , $74 and $57 , respectively. Rental expense for leased properties was $287 , $276 and $270 , for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. At December 31, 2013 , minimum rental payments under capital leases aggregated $134 . Minimum rental payments under operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more aggregated $1,401 , net of sublease payments of $14 at December 31, 2013 . Payments due under operating and capital leases net of sublease amounts and non-cancellable future rentals during the next five years are as follows: ##TABLE_START      Minimum operating lease payments, net of sublease amounts $223  $171  $142  $120  $95 Minimum capital lease payments, net of sublease amounts     ##TABLE_ENDAccounts payable related to purchases of property, plant and equipment were $213 and $234 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 .

The $356 includes $147 related to a payment made by us under a bank guarantee on behalf of Sea Launch and $209 related to loans (partner loans) we made to Sea Launch. The net amounts owed to Boeing by each of the partners are as follows: S.P. Koroley Rocket and Space Corporation Energia of Russia  $223 , PO Yuzhnoye Mashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukraine  $89 and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine  $44 . Although each partner is contractually obligated to reimburse us for its share of the bank guarantee, the Russian and Ukrainian partners have raised defenses to enforcement and contested our claims. On October 19, 2009, we filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launch partners of the  $147 bank guarantee payment. On October 7, 2010, the arbitrator ruled that the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter but did not resolve the merits of our claim. We filed a notice appealing the arbitrators ruling on January 11, 2011. The Ukrainian partners responded to our appeal on June 30, 2012 and the Russian partner responded on July 3, 2012. We filed replies on September 20, 2012. On February 1, 2013, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launch partners of the $147 bank guarantee payment and the $209 partner loan obligations. We believe the partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and remedies. In the event we are unable to secure reimbursement of $147 related to our payment under the bank guarantee and $209 related to partner loans made to Sea Launch, we could incur additional pre-tax charges of up to $356 . Note 11  Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Accrued compensation and employee benefit costs $6,158  $5,769 Environmental  Product warranties 1,570  1,572 Forward loss recognition  Dividends payable  Other 4,852  4,190 Total $14,131  $12,995 ##TABLE_ENDEnvironmental The following table summarizes environmental remediation activity during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 . ##TABLE_START   Beginning balance  January 1 $710  $758 Reductions for payments made (120 )  (121 ) Changes in estimates  Ending balance  December 31 $649  $710 ##TABLE_ENDThe liabilities recorded represent our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred to remediate sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios which include the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. There are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by $928 and $865 . Product Warranties The following table summarizes product warranty activity recorded during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 . ##TABLE_START   Beginning balance  January 1 $1,572  $1,046 Additions for current year deliveries  Reductions for payments made (419 )  (315 ) Changes in estimates (178 )  Ending balance - December 31 $1,570  $1,572 ##TABLE_ENDCommercial Aircraft Commitments In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and airline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer. Trade-in commitment agreements at December 31, 2013 have expiration dates from 2014 through 2023 . At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , total contractual trade-in commitments were $1,605 and $1,535 . As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we estimated that it was probable we would be obligated to perform on certain of these commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling $325 and $108 and the fair value of the related trade-in aircraft was $325 and $108 . Financing Commitments Financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, totaled $17,987 and $18,083 as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 . The estimated earliest potential funding dates for these commitments as of December 31, 2013 are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Total $2,309 2,914 3,257 3,026 1,930 Thereafter 4,551  $17,987 ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2013 all of these financing commitments related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. We have concluded that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralization and interest rates, under which funding would be provided. Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $4,376 and $4,545 as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 . Commitments to ULA We and Lockheed Martin Corporation have each committed to provide ULA with up to $527 of additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. See Note 6 . C-17 In September 2013, we decided to end production of C-17 aircraft in 2015 and recorded charges of $92 , primarily for pension curtailment costs. We plan to produce 20 C-17 aircraft in 2014 and 2015 before ending production. At December 31, 2013 , our backlog included 6 international orders for C-17 aircraft that are scheduled for delivery through mid-2014 and we have active sales campaigns for the remaining 14 unsold aircraft. We are currently incurring costs and have made commitments to suppliers related to the unsold aircraft. We believe it is probable that we will recover costs related to the unsold aircraft from international customer orders. Should orders for the 14 unsold aircraft not materialize or should we decide to discontinue production of unsold aircraft, we could incur charges to write-down inventory and/or record termination liabilities. At December 31, 2013 , we had approximately $430 of capitalized precontract costs and $420 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers associated with the unsold aircraft. Company Owned Life Insurance McDonnell Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life insurance policies with a cash surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the cash surrender value was $451 and $423 and the total loans were $425 and $400 . As we have the right to offset the loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 . United States Government Defense Environment Overview U.S. government appropriation levels remain subject to significant uncertainty. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act (The Act) established limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending by approximately $490 billion between the 2012 and 2021 U.S. government fiscal years. The Act also provided that the defense budget would face sequestration cuts of up to an additional $500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded. The impact of sequestration cuts was reduced with respect to FY2014 and FY2015 following the enactment of The Bipartisan Budget Act in December 2013. However, significant uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure, including risk of future sequestration cuts. In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) and other government agencies (including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration) within the overall budgetary framework described above. While the FY2014 appropriations finalized in January 2014 included funding for Boeings major programs, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in FY2015 and beyond will affect Boeings programs. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. In addition to the risks described above, if Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner, a government shutdown could result which could have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts or sequestration impacts. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. DoD or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders. BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work. BDS fixed-price contracts with significant development work include Airborne Early Warning and Control, India P-8I, Saudi Arabia F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker and commercial and military satellites. The operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost and revenue estimates could also result in lower margins or a material charge for reach-forward losses in 2014 . Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts Our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve for amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide refunds to the U.S. government. 747 and 787 Commercial Airplane Programs The development and initial production of new commercial airplanes and new commercial airplane derivatives, which include the 747 and 787, entail significant commitments to customers and suppliers as well as substantial investments in working capital, infrastructure and research and development. The 747 and 787 programs had gross margins that were breakeven or near breakeven during 2013 . Continued weakness in the air cargo market and lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger aircraft have resulted in pricing pressures and fewer 747 orders than anticipated. We continue to have a number of unsold 747 production positions. If market and production risks cannot be mitigated, the program could face a reach-forward loss that may be material. The combination of production challenges, change incorporation, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts has created significant pressure on 787 program profitability. If risks related to this program, including risks associated with planned production rate increases, or introducing the 787-9 and 787-10 derivatives as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions, as well as a reach-forward loss that may be material. Note 12  Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees. The following table provides quantitative data regarding our third party guarantees. The maximum potential payments represent a worst-case scenario, and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset our payments under guarantees. The carrying amount of liabilities represents the amount included in Accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_START  Maximum Potential Payments  Estimated Proceeds from Collateral/ Recourse  Carrying Amount of Liabilities December 31, 2012  2012  2012 Contingent repurchase commitments $1,872 $2,065  $1,871 $2,065  $5 $5 Indemnifications to ULA:         Contributed Delta program launch inventory 137       Contract pricing 261     7 Other Delta contracts 232     8 Other indemnifications 137     32 Credit guarantees 13  4  2 ##TABLE_ENDContingent Repurchase Commitments The repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase commitments is generally lower than the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date. Indemnifications to ULA In 2006, we agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 of Boeing Delta launch program inventory included in contributed assets plus $1,860 of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021 . Since inception, ULA has consumed $1,233 of the $1,360 of inventory that was contributed by us and has yet to consume $127 . ULA has made advance payments of $1,380 to us and we have recorded revenues and cost of sales of $1,049 under the inventory supply agreement through December 31, 2013 . We agreed to indemnify ULA against potential losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) for four satellite missions. We believe ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing. In December 2008, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value for two satellite missions. In March 2009, the USAF issued a denial of that claim. In June 2009, ULA filed a notice of appeal, and in October 2009, ULA filed a complaint before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) for a contract adjustment for the price of the two satellite missions. In September 2009, the USAF exercised its option for a third satellite mission. During the third quarter of 2010, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value of the third mission. The USAF did not exercise an option for a fourth mission prior to th e expiration. In March 2011, ULA filed a notice of appeal before the ASBCA, seeking to re-price the third mission. The hearing before the ASBCA concluded on December 20, 2013 and a post-trial briefing is expected by May 2014. If ULA is unsuccessful in obtaining additional pricing, we may be responsible for a portion of the shortfall and may record up to $278 in pre-tax losses associated with the three missions, representing up to $261 for the indemnification payment and up to $17 for our portion of additional contract losses incurred by ULA. Potential payments for Other Delta contracts include $85 related to deferred support costs. In June 2011, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) notified ULA that it had determined that $271 of deferred support costs are not recoverable under government contracts. In December 2011, the DCMA notified ULA of the potential non-recoverability of an additional $114 of deferred production costs. The DCMA has not yet issued a final decision related to the recoverability of the $114 . ULA and Boeing believe that all costs are recoverable and in November 2011, ULA filed a certified claim with the USAF for collection of deferred support and production costs. The USAF issued a final decision denying ULAs certified claim in May 2012. On June 14, 2012, Boeing and ULA filed a suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking recovery of the deferred support and production costs from the U.S. government. On November 9, 2012, the U.S. government filed an answer to our claim and asserted a counterclaim for credits that it alleges were offset by deferred support cost invoices. We believe that the U.S. governments counterclaim is without merit, and have filed an answer challenging it on multiple grounds. The litigation proceeds, with no trial date having yet been set. If, contrary to our belief, it is determined that some or all of the deferred support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record pre-tax losses and make indemnification payments to ULA for up to $317 of the costs questioned by the DCMA. Other Indemnifications As part of the 2004 sale agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation related to the sale of Boeing Capitals (BCC) Commercial Financial Services business, BCC is involved in a loss sharing arrangement for losses on transferred portfolio assets, such as asset sales, provisions for loss or asset impairment charges offset by gains from asset sales. At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , our maximum future cash exposure to losses associated with the loss sharing arrangement was $106 and $137 and our accrued liability under the loss sharing arrangement was $28 and $32 . In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and our Commercial Airplanes facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. It is impossible to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 11 . Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees, principally to facilitate the sale and/or financing of commercial aircraft. Under these arrangements, we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that lease or loan payments are not made by the original lessee or debtor or certain specified services are not performed. A substantial portion of these guarantees has been extended on behalf of original lessees or debtors with less than investment-grade credit. Our commercial aircraft credit guarantees are collateralized by the underlying commercial aircraft and certain other assets. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire within the next seven years. Industrial Revenue Bonds Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by the City of Wichita were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property at our Wichita site. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a ten-year property tax abatement and a sales tax exemption from the Kansas Department of Revenue. We record the property on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, along with a capital lease obligation to repay the proceeds of the IRB. We have also purchased the IRBs and therefore are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the property purchased with the IRB proceeds. The capital lease obligation and IRB asset are recorded net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the assets and liabilities associated with the City of Wichita IRBs were $690 and $738 . Note 13  Debt On May 3, 2013 , we issued $350 of fixed rate senior notes due May 15, 2018 (Fixed Rate Senior Notes) and $150 of floating rate senior notes due November 3, 2014 (Floating Rate Senior Notes). The Fixed Rate Senior Notes bear an annual interest rate of 0.95% , and may be redeemed at our option at any time for a redemption price equal to the full principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole premium. The Floating Rate Senior Notes bear an annual interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus one basis point, and are not redeemable prior to maturity. The notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds of the issuance totaling $494 , after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, were used to fund BCC. Interest incurred, including amounts capitalized, was $548 , $625 and $683 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Interest expense recorded by BCC is reflected as a separate line item on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and is included in Earnings from operations. Total Company interest payments were $551 , $614 and $626 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. We have $4,845 currently available under credit line agreements, of which $2,392 is a 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in November 2014 and $2,453 is a five-year credit facility, of which $2,393 expires in November 2018 and $60 in November 2017 . The 364-day credit facility has a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration date. We continue to be in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt or credit facility agreements. Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START  2012 Unsecured debt securities $1,370  $1,224 Non-recourse debt and notes  Capital lease obligations  Other notes  Total $1,563  $1,436 ##TABLE_ENDDebt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Unsecured debt securities    Variable rate: 3-month USD LIBOR plus 1 basis point due 2014 $150  0.95% - 5.00% due through 2023 4,832  $4,521 5.80% - 6.88% due through 2043 2,392  3,591 7.25%  8.75% due through 2043 1,672  1,672 Non-recourse debt and notes    4.12% - 4.84% notes due through 2013   6.98% - 7.38% notes due through 2021  Capital lease obligations due through 2017  Other notes  Total debt $9,635  $10,409 ##TABLE_ENDTotal debt is attributable to: ##TABLE_START   BCC $2,577  $2,742 Other Boeing 7,058  7,667 Total debt $9,635  $10,409 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2013 , $256 of debt (non-recourse debt and notes and capital lease obligations) was collateralized by customer financing assets totaling $404 . Scheduled principal payments for debt and minimum capital lease obligations for the next five years are as follows: ##TABLE_START      Scheduled principal payments $1,562  $888  $1,075  $58  $638 ##TABLE_ENDNote 14  Postretirement Plans The majority of our employees are earning benefits under defined benefit pension plans. All nonunion and some union employees hired after December 31, 2008 are not covered by defined benefit plans. We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans participants, and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for future benefit payments. We also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for approximately half those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered by most United Auto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage. The funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). We have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Other assets, and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in Accrued liabilities. The components of net periodic benefit cost were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits Years ended December 31,      Service cost $1,886  $1,649  $1,406  $148  $146  $221 Interest cost 2,906  3,005  3,116    Expected return on plan assets (3,874 )  (3,831 )  (3,741 )  (6 )  (7 )  (6 ) Amortization of prior service costs    (180 )  (197 )  (96 ) Recognized net actuarial loss 2,231  1,937  1,254    Settlement and curtailment loss     (1 )  Net periodic benefit cost $3,449  $3,010  $2,343  $320  $373  $784             Net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations $3,036  $2,407  $1,648  $353  $543  $692 ##TABLE_ENDDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2011, we determined the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for certain other postretirement benefit plans was understated. As a result, we recognized an additional $294 of postretirement benefit obligations at September 30, 2011. This increased net periodic benefit cost during 2011 by $184 , which includes service cost of $73 , interest cost of $68 and recognized net actuarial loss of $43 . Under our accounting policy, a portion of net periodic benefit cost is allocated to production as inventoried costs. Of the $184 increase in net periodic benefit cost described above, the associated cost included in Earnings from operations was $161 for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, with the remaining cost of $23 classified as inventory. The following tables show changes in the benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status of both pensions and OPB for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 . Benefit obligation balances presented below reflect the PBO for our pension plans, and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations (APBO) for our OPB plans. ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits     Change in benefit obligation        Beginning balance $75,895  $67,651  $7,981  $7,997 Service cost 1,886  1,649   Interest cost 2,906  3,005   Plan participants contributions    Amendments    Actuarial (gain)/loss (9,205 )  6,378  (905 )  (53 ) Settlement/curtailment/other (81 )  (76 )  (57 )  (1 ) Gross benefits paid (2,874 )  (2,744 )  (451 )  (474 ) Subsidies      Exchange rate adjustment (21 )   (7 )  Ending balance $68,625  $75,895  $7,008  $7,981 Change in plan assets        Beginning balance at fair value $56,178  $51,051  $110  $102 Actual return on plan assets 3,316  6,300   Company contribution 1,542  1,550   Plan participants contributions    Settlement/curtailment/other (103 )  (71 )   Benefits paid (2,792 )  (2,669 )  (21 )  (21 ) Exchange rate adjustment (18 )    Ending balance at fair value $58,131  $56,178  $140  $110 Amounts recognized in statement of financial position at December 31 consist of:        Other assets $60  $5     Other accrued liabilities (80 )  (71 )  ($340 )  ($343 ) Accrued retiree health care   (6,528 )  (7,528 ) Accrued pension plan liability, net (10,474 )  (19,651 )     Net amount recognized ($10,494 )  ($19,717 )  ($6,868 )  ($7,871 ) ##TABLE_ENDAmounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits     Net actuarial loss $15,460  $26,387  $561  $1,651 Prior service costs/(credits)   (614 )  (799 ) Total recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss $16,248  $27,291  ($53 )  $852 ##TABLE_ENDThe estimated amount that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during the year ended December 31, 2014 is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits Recognized net actuarial loss $1,032  $7 Amortization of prior service costs/(credits)  (141 ) Total $1,210  ($134 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe ABO for all pension plans was $63,491 and $69,312 at December 31, 2013 and 2012 . Key information for our plans with ABO in excess of plan assets as of December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Projected benefit obligation $63,445  $75,851 Accumulated benefit obligation 58,334  69,272 Fair value of plan assets 52,905  56,129 ##TABLE_ENDAssumptions The following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31 of each year and the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year. ##TABLE_START December 31,   Discount rate:      Pension 4.80 %  3.80 %  4.40 % Other postretirement benefits 4.20 %  3.30 %  4.00 % Expected return on plan assets 7.50 %  7.50 %  7.75 % Rate of compensation increase 4.00 %  4.00 %  3.90 % ##TABLE_ENDThe discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high quality bonds that are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yields developed from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. A portfolio of about 400 bonds is used to construct the yield curve. Since corporate bond yields are generally not available at maturities beyond 30 years, it is assumed that spot rates will remain level beyond that 30-year point. The present value of each plans benefits is calculated by applying the spot/discount rates to projected benefit cash flows. All bonds are U.S. issues, with a minimum outstanding of $50. The pension funds expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the upcoming plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five -year moving average of plan assets. As of December 31, 2013 , the MRVA is approximately $1,340 less than the fair market value of assets. Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows: ##TABLE_START December 31,   Health care cost trend rate assumed next year 7.00 %  7.50 %  7.50 % Ultimate trend rate 5.00 %  5.00 %  5.00 % Year that trend reached ultimate rate   ##TABLE_ENDAssumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. To determine the health care cost trend rates we look at a combination of information including ongoing claims cost monitoring, annual statistical analyses of claims data, reconciliation of forecast claims against actual claims, review of trend assumptions of other plan sponsors and national health trends, and adjustments for plan design changes, workforce changes, and changes in plan participant behavior. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect: ##TABLE_START  Increase  Decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost $57  ($47 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation  (575 ) ##TABLE_ENDPlan Assets Investment Strategy The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive, total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified. We periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investment benchmarks for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions (such as private equity and real estate), and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced on a monthly basis. The actual and target allocations by asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Actual Allocations  Target Allocations Asset Class    Fixed income %  %  %  % Global equity    Private equity    Real estate and real assets    Global strategies    Hedge funds    Total %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDFixed income securities are invested broadly and primarily in long duration instruments. Global equity securities are invested broadly in U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various industries and market capitalizations. Real estate and real assets include global private investments that may be held through an investment in a limited partnership (LP) or other fund structures and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) in the case of real estate). Real estate includes but is not limited to investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include but are not limited to investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber), commodities and infrastructure. Private equity investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) and fund-of-funds that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies. Global strategies investments seek to capitalize on inefficiencies identified across different asset classes or markets, primarily using long-short positions in derivatives and physical securities. Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to, event driven, relative value, long-short and multi-strategy. Investment managers are retained for explicit investment roles specified by contractual investment guidelines. Certain investment managers are authorized to invest in derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve the desired market exposure of a security or an index, transfer value-added performance between asset classes, achieve the desired currency exposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation. As a percentage of total pension plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were 18.3% and 10.0% for fixed income, including to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and (2.2%) and (0.3)% for global equity, currency overlay and commodities at December 31, 2013 and 2012 . Risk Management In managing the plan assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach and are integral to the overall investment strategy. Further, asset classes are constructed to achieve diversification by investment strategy, by investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored regularly through the custodian. Credit parameters for counterparties have been established for managers permitted to trade over-the-counter derivatives. Valuation is governed through several types of procedures, including reviews of manager valuation policies, custodian valuation processes, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconciliation, and periodic, security-specific valuation testing . Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 . The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012  Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fixed income securities:         Corporate $15,262 $15,238 $24 $14,363 $14,360 $3 U.S. government and agencies 4,537 4,537 4,921 4,921 Mortgage backed and asset backed 1,040 549 191 Municipal 1,722 1,722 1,770  1,770 Sovereign 1,018 1,018 1,045  1,045  Common/collective/pooled funds 2,538 $16 2,522 2,346 $17 2,329  Other (1) 229 220 219 Derivatives:         Assets 55 1 Liabilities (10 ) (10 ) (23 ) (23 ) Cash equivalents and other short-term investments 801 2,687 2,224 Currency overlay derivatives:         Assets 2 56 Liabilities (3 ) (3 ) (55 ) (55 ) Equity securities:         U.S. common and preferred stock 6,919 6,919 6,144 6,144 Non-U.S. common and preferred stock 7,722 7,721 7,421 7,421 Common/collective/pooled funds 3,239 2,675 2,294 1,950 Derivatives:         Assets 4 19 Liabilities (6 ) (6 ) (9 ) (9 ) Private equity (1) 2,968 2,958 2,942 2,916 Real estate and real assets:         Real estate 2,865 16 2,424 2,765 14 2,128 Real assets 1,506 464 1,327 377 Derivatives:         Assets 1 1 Liabilities (1 ) (1 ) (2 ) (2 ) Global strategies 2,355 2,355 2,147 2,147 Hedge funds 2,776 1,667 1,109 2,736 1,263 1,473 Total $57,794 $15,991 $33,777 $8,026 $55,903 $17,087 $31,071 $7,745          Cash $87    $94    Receivables       Payables (208 )    (207 )    Total $58,131    $56,178    ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Certain private funds with a fixed income strategy were reclassified from private equity to other fixed income on January 1, 2013. ##TABLE_END Fixed income securities are primarily valued upon a market approach, using matrix pricing and considering a securitys relationship to other securities for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or an income approach, converting future cash flows to a single present value amount. Inputs used in developing fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads. Common/collective/pooled funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their net asset values (NAVs) that are calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives included in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued using an income approach with inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates. Exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Cash equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingled fund (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued daily using a market approach with inputs that include quoted market prices for similar instruments. In the event a market price is not available for instruments with an original maturity of one year or less, amortized cost is used as a proxy for fair value. Common and preferred stock equity securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Private equity and private debt NAV valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) we use NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Real estate and real asset NAV valuations are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) NAVs are adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Publicly traded REITs and infrastructure stocks are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Global strategies investments are primarily limited liability company (LLC) or mutual fund structures. The NAVs are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which are primarily valued using a market approach. The funds generally have monthly liquidity. Hedge funds consist of fund-of-fund LLC structures and direct hedge funds. The NAVs of the fund-of-funds are based on the NAVs of the underlying hedge funds as well as any cash and accruals held at the fund-of-fund level. For direct hedge funds the NAVs are primarily based on valuation of the underlying investments. This is primarily done by applying a market or income valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument held. Redemptions in hedge funds are based on specific terms and conditions of the individual funds. Investments in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, global strategies, and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the General Partner (GP), fund manager or third party administrator. Pension assets invested in these structures rely on the NAV of these investments as the practical expedient for the valuations. The following tables present a reconciliation of Level 3 assets held during the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 . Transfers into and out of Level 3 are reported at the beginning-of-year values. ##TABLE_START  January 1, 2013 Balance  Net Realized and Unrealized Gains  Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements  Net Transfers Into/(Out of) Level 3  December 31, Balance Fixed income securities:          Corporate $3   $16  $5  $24 Mortgage backed and asset backed   (11 )  (1 )  Other (1)  $37  (27 )   Equity securities:         Non-U.S. common and preferred stock     Private equity (1) 2,671   (249 )   2,958 Real estate and real assets:          Real estate 2,128     2,424 Real assets   (36 )   Hedge funds 1,473   (627 )   1,109 Total $7,745  $1,066  ($870 )  $85  $8,026 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Certain private funds with a fixed income strategy were reclassified from private equity to other fixed income on January 1, 2013. ##TABLE_END For the year ended December 31, 2013 , the change in unrealized gain for Level 3 assets still held at December 31, 2013 were $21 for other fixed income, $422 for private equity, $243 for real estate, $71 for real assets and $283 for hedge funds. ##TABLE_START  January 1, 2012 Balance  Net Realized and Unrealized Gains/(Losses)  Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements  Net Transfers Into/(Out of) Level 3  December 31, Balance Fixed income securities:          Corporate $11  ($12 )  $11  ($7 )  $3 Mortgage backed and asset backed     Municipal     (3 )  Private equity 2,859   (151 )    2,916 Real estate and real assets:          Real estate 1,820      2,128 Real assets      Global strategies     (75 )  Hedge funds 2,451    (1,134 )  1,473 Total $7,777  $519  $310  ($861 )  $7,745 ##TABLE_ENDFor the year ended December 31, 2012 , the change in unrealized gain/(loss) for Level 3 assets still held at December 31, 2012 were ($12) for corporate, $36 for mortgage backed and asset backed, $113 for private equity, $579 for real estate, $62 for real assets and $101 for hedge funds. OPB Plan Assets The majority of OPB plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised of approximately 60% equities and 40% debt securities. The index fund is valued using a market approach based on the quoted market price of an identical instrument (Level 1). The expected rate of return on these assets does not have a material effect on the net periodic benefit cost. Cash Flows Contributions Required pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ), as well as rules governing funding of our non-U.S. pension plans, are expected to be minimal in 2014 . We expect to make discretionary contributions to our plans of approximately $750 in 2014 . We expect to contribute approximately $12 to our OPB plans in 2014 . Estimated Future Benefit Payments The table below reflects the total pension benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants share of the cost, which is funded by participant contributions. OPB payments reflect our portion only. ##TABLE_START Year(s)      2019-2023 Pensions $3,173  $3,346  $3,522  $3,696  $3,865  $21,112 Other postretirement benefits:            Gross benefits paid      3,250 Subsidies (39 )  (41 )  (41 )  (42 )  (43 )  (215 ) Net other postretirement benefits $439  $466  $498  $525  $571  $3,035 ##TABLE_ENDTermination Provisions Certain of the pension plans provide that, in the event there is a change in control of the Company which is not approved by the Board of Directors and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required by ERISA , and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits in our group insurance benefit programs. We have an agreement with the U.S. government with respect to certain pension plans. Under the agreement, should we terminate any of the plans under conditions in which the plans assets exceed that plans obligations, the U.S. government will be entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plans assets based on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts. Defined Contribution Plans We provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expense for these defined contribution plans was $742 , $708 and $658 in 2013, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Note 15  Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements Share-Based Compensation Our 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated effective February 21, 2011, permits awards of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, stock units, performance shares, performance units and other incentives to our employees, officers, consultants and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock available for issuance under the amended plan will not exceed 80,000,000 and no more than an aggregate of 16,000,000 shares are available for issuance as restricted stock awards. Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to meet any requirements to issue shares during 2014 . Share-based plans expense is primarily included in General and administrative expense since it is incentive compensation issued primarily to our executives. The share-based plans expense and related income tax benefit were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Stock options $93  $85  $88 Restricted stock units and other awards   Share-based plans expense $206  $193  $186 Income tax benefit $76  $75  $73 ##TABLE_ENDStock Options In February 2013, 2012 and 2011 , we granted to our executives 6,591,968 , 6,114,922 and 5,426,910 options, respectively. The options have been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. The stock options vest over a period of three years, with 34% vesting after the first year, 33% vesting after the second year and the remaining 33% vesting after the third year. If an executive terminates employment for any reason, the non-vested portion of the stock option will not vest and all rights to the non-vested portion will terminate completely. Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2013 is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Shares  Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share  Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years)  Aggregate Intrinsic Value Number of shares under option:        Outstanding at beginning of year 33,664,018  $71.81     Granted 6,698,861  76.35     Exercised (15,605,753)  70.31     Forfeited (926,233)  74.74     Expired (63,150)  68.30     Outstanding at end of year 23,767,743  $73.97  6.81  $1,486 Exercisable at end of year 12,552,449  $72.70  5.11  $801 ##TABLE_ENDThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was $546 , $89 and $67 during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Cash received from options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $1,097 , $120 and $114 with a related tax benefit of $190 , $29 and $23 , respectively, derived from the compensation deductions resulting from these option exercises. At December 31, 2013 , there was $95 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to our stock option plan which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. The grant date fair value of stock options vested during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $89 , $83 and $92 , respectively. The fair values of options were estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: ##TABLE_START Grant Year Grant Date  Expected Life  Expected Volatility  Expected Dividend Yield  Risk Free Interest Rate  Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share 2/25/2013  6 years  29.0 %  2.6 %  1.0 %  $15.85 2/27/2012  6 years  29.9 %  2.4 %  1.1 %  $16.89 2/22/2011  6 years  29.8 %  2.3 %  2.5 %  $17.96 ##TABLE_ENDThe expected volatility of the stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock volatility and the volatility levels implied on the grant date by actively traded option contracts on our common stock. We determined the expected term of the stock option grants to be six years, calculated using the simplified method in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 110. We use the simplified method since we changed the vesting terms, tax treatment and the recipients of our stock options beginning in 2006 such that we believe our historical data prior to 2006 does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term and we do not have enough option exercise data from our grants issued subsequent to 2006 to support our own estimate as a result of vesting terms and changes in the stock price. Restricted Stock Units In February 2013, 2012 and 2011 , we granted to our executives 1,375,414 , 1,369,810 and 1,364,440  restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of $75.97 , $75.40 and $71.44 per share, respectively. The RSUs granted under this program will vest and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will immediately vest on a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate completely. In addition to RSUs awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant RSUs to certain executives and employees to encourage retention or to reward various achievements. These RSUs are labeled other restricted stock units in the table below. The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average stock price on the date of grant. Stock units settle in common stock on a one-for-one basis and are not contingent upon stock price. Stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2013 is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Incentive Program Restricted Stock Units  Other Restricted Stock Units Number of units:    Outstanding at beginning of year 3,897,449  1,251,189 Granted 1,398,286  225,815 Dividends 72,405  21,573 Forfeited (201,030 )  (15,614 ) Distributed (1,444,793 )  (350,033 ) Outstanding at end of year 3,722,317  1,132,930 Unrecognized compensation cost $104  $28 Weighted average remaining contractual life (years) 1.8  2.2 ##TABLE_ENDOther Compensation Arrangements Performance Awards Performance Awards are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a three-year period. Each unit has an initial value of $100 dollars. The amount payable at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars per unit, depending on the Companys performance against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to pay these awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on the estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period. During 2013, 2012 and 2011 , we granted Performance Awards to our executives with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals for each three -year period following the grant date. The minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out for the 2013, 2012 and 2011 Performance Awards is $275 , $259 and $248 , respectively. The 2011 grant is expected to be paid out in cash in March 2014 . Deferred Compensation The Company has a deferred compensation plan which permits executives to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus, and certain other incentive awards. Participants can diversify deferred compensation among 23 investment funds including a Boeing stock unit account. Total expense related to deferred compensation was $238 , $75 and $59 in 2013, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the deferred compensation liability which is being marked to market was $1,258 and $1,104 . Note 16  Shareholders Equity On October 29, 2007, the Board approved the repurchase of up to $7,000 of common stock (the 2007 Program). At December 31, 2013 , $810 in shares may still be repurchased under the Program. On December 16, 2013, the Board approved a new repurchase plan (the 2013 Program) for up to $10,000 of common stock that commences following the completion of the 2007 Program. Unless terminated earlier by a Board resolution, the Program will expire when we have used all authorized funds for repurchase. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , there were 1,200,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. No preferred stock has been issued. Changes in Share Balances The following table shows changes in each class of shares: ##TABLE_START  Common Stock  Treasury Stock Balance at January 1, 2011 1,012,261,159  277,002,059 Issued   (9,800,174 ) Acquired   354,503 Balance at December 31, 2011 1,012,261,159  267,556,388 Issued   (11,935,423 ) Acquired   1,009,663 Balance at December 31, 2012 1,012,261,159  256,630,628 Issued   (17,903,704 ) Acquired   26,155,537 Balance at December 31, 2013 1,012,261,159  264,882,461 ##TABLE_ENDAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI) by component for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Currency Translation Adjustments  Unrealized Gains and Losses on Certain Investments  Unrealized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments  Defined Benefit Pension Plans  Other Postretirement Benefits  Total (1) Balance at January 1, 2011 $232  ($6 )  $95  ($14,079 )  ($13,758 ) Other comprehensive loss before reclassifications (35 )  (2 )  (13 )  (3,721 )  (3,771 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI   (16 )  1,045 (2)  1,029 Net current period Other comprehensive loss (35 )  (2 )  (29 )  (2,676 )  (2,742 ) Balance at December 31, 2011 $197  ($8 )  $66  ($16,755 )  ($16,500 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications    (2,290 )  (2,248 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI   (5 )  1,337 (2)  1,332 Net current period Other comprehensive income/(loss)    (953 )  (916 ) Balance at December 31, 2012 $214  ($8 )  $86  ($17,708 )  ($17,416 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications (64 )   (75 )  6,093  5,954 Amounts reclassified from AOCI   (17 )  1,585 (2)  1,568 Net current period Other comprehensive income/(loss) (64 )   (92 )  7,678  7,522 Balance at December 31, 2013 $150  ($8 )  ($6 )  ($10,030 )  ($9,894 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Net of tax. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Primarily relates to amortization of actuarial gains/losses for the years ended December 31, 2013  2012 and 2011 totaling $1,516 , $1,304 and $909 (net of tax of ($849) , ($752)  and ($523) ) which is included in the net periodic pension cost of which a portion is allocated to production as inventoried costs. See Note 14 . ##TABLE_END Note 17  Derivative Financial Instruments Cash Flow Hedges Our cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, commodity swaps, and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage currency risk associated with certain transactions, specifically forecasted sales and purchases made in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency contracts hedge forecasted transactions principally occurring within five years in the future, with certain contracts hedging transactions through 2023 . We use commodity derivatives, such as swaps and fixed-price purchase commitments to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. Our commodity contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2017 . Fair Value Hedges Interest rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt. The net change in fair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in Boeing Capital interest expense. Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment We also hold certain derivative instruments, primarily foreign currency forward contracts, for risk management purposes that are not receiving hedge accounting treatment. Notional Amounts and Fair Values The notional amounts and fair values of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Notional amounts (1) Other assets Accrued liabilities   2013  2013  Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:          Foreign exchange contracts $2,524  $2,310 $122  $202 ($64 )  ($16 ) Interest rate contracts  13     Commodity contracts  2   (39 )  (71 ) Derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment:          Foreign exchange contracts  12  (35 )  (42 ) Commodity contracts     (4 )  (8 ) Total derivatives $3,177  $3,224  (142 )  (137 ) Netting arrangements    (63 )  (53 )  Net recorded balance    $86  $178 ($79 ) ($84 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Notional amounts represent the gross contract/notional amount of the derivatives outstanding. ##TABLE_END Gains/(losses) associated with our cash flow and undesignated hedging transactions and their effect on Other comprehensive income/(loss) and Net earnings were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  Effective portion recognized in Other comprehensive income/(loss), net of taxes:    Foreign exchange contracts ($76 )  $35 Commodity contracts  (10 ) Effective portion reclassified out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings, net of taxes:    Foreign exchange contracts  Commodity contracts (20 )  (30 ) Forward points recognized in Other income, net:    Foreign exchange contracts  Undesignated derivatives recognized in Other income, net:    Foreign exchange contracts  (16 ) ##TABLE_ENDBased on our portfolio of cash flow hedges, we expect to reclassify losses of $6 (pre-tax) out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings during the next 12 months. Ineffectiveness related to our hedges recognized in Other income was insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 . We have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. For foreign exchange contracts with original maturities of at least five years, our derivative counterparties could require settlement if we default on our five-year credit facility. For commodity contracts, our counterparties could require collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and commodity contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at December 31, 2013 was $7 . At December 31, 2013 , there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives. Note 18  Significant Group Concentrations of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments involving potential credit risk are predominantly with commercial aircraft customers and the U.S. government. Of the $10,670 in gross accounts receivable and gross customer financing included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2013 , $4,870 related predominantly to commercial aircraft customers ( $924 of accounts receivable and $3,946 of customer financing) and $3,604 related to the U.S. government. Of the $4,020 in gross customer financing, $2,720 related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit including American Airlines, United/Continental Airlines, and Hawaiian Airlines who were associated with 11% , 9% and 8% , respectively, of our financing portfolio. Financing for aircraft is collateralized by security in the related asset and in some instances security in other assets as well. Other Risk As of December 31, 2013 , approximately 38% of our total workforce was represented by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 1% of our total workforce was represented by agreements expiring in 2014 . Note 19  Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012   Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets         Money market funds $3,783 $3,783   $4,534 $4,534   Available-for-sale investments 6  $2 6  $3 Derivatives  $86   $178  Total assets $3,877 $3,789 $86 $2 $4,721 $4,540 $178 $3          Liabilities         Derivatives ($79 )  ($79 )  ($84 )  ($84 )  Total liabilities ($79 )  ($79 )  ($84 )  ($84 )  ##TABLE_ENDMoney market funds and available-for-sale equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Available-for-sale debt investments are primarily valued using an income approach based on benchmark yields, reported trades and broker/dealer quotes. Derivatives include foreign currency, commodity and interest rate contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve. Certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following table presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended December 31, and the fair value and asset classification of the related assets as of the impairment date: ##TABLE_START    Fair Value  Total Losses  Fair Value  Total Losses Operating lease equipment $216  ($81 )  $75  ($55 ) Property, plant and equipment  (15 )   (21 ) Total $256  ($96 )  $96  ($76 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of the impaired operating lease equipment is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of third party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades and other market factors. Management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued appropriateness and consistency with market trends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected net sales price for the aircraft. Property, plant and equipment was primarily valued using an income approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. For Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2012, the following table presents the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques and related unobservable inputs of those assets. ##TABLE_START  Fair Value  Valuation Technique(s)  Unobservable Input  Range Median or Average Operating lease equipment $216  Market approach  Aircraft value publications  $155 - $206 (1) Median $189   Aircraft condition adjustments  ($18) - $45 (2) Net $27 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  The range represents the sum of the highest and lowest values for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, according to the third party aircraft valuation publications that we use in our valuation process. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The negative amount represents the sum for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, of all downward adjustments based on consideration of individual aircraft attributes and condition. The positive amount represents the sum of all such upward adjustments. ##TABLE_END Fair Value Disclosures The fair values and related carrying values of financial instruments that are not required to be remeasured at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2013  Carrying Amount  Total Fair Value  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets          Accounts receivable, net $6,546  $6,525    $6,525   Notes receivable, net       Liabilities          Debt, excluding capital lease obligations (9,483 )  (10,897 )    (10,897 )   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  December 31, 2012  Carrying Amount  Total Fair Value  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets          Accounts receivable, net $5,608  $5,642    $5,642   Notes receivable, net       Liabilities          Debt, excluding capital lease obligations (10,231 )  (12,269 )    (12,221 )  ($48 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of Accounts receivable is based on current market rates for loans of the same risk and maturities. The fair values of our variable rate notes receivable that reprice frequently approximate their carrying amounts. The fair values of fixed rate notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on current market yields. For our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowing cost derived from dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. The fair value of our debt classified as Level 3 is based on the median of the underlying collateral value as described above. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain. Items not included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, Accounts payable and long-term payables. The carrying values of those items, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at December 31, 2013 and 2012 . The fair value of assets and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1). Note 20  Legal Proceedings Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts and other matters are pending against us. Potentially material contingencies are discussed below. In addition, the discussion below addresses the settlement of the A-12 litigation. We are subject to various U.S. government investigations, from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such government disputes and investigations will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, except as set forth below. Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we have disclosed either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made. A-12 Litigation In 1991, the Department of the Navy (the Navy) notified McDonnell Douglas Corporation (now merged into The Boeing Company) and General Dynamics Corporation (together, the Team) that it was terminating for default the Teams contract for development and initial production of the A-12 aircraft. The Team had full responsibility for performance of the contract and both contractors are jointly and severally liable for any potential liabilities resulting from the termination. The Team filed a legal action to contest the Navys default termination, to assert its rights to convert the termination to one for the convenience of the government, and to obtain payment for work done and costs incurred on the A-12 contract but not paid to date. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims held that the default termination decision could not be sustained and on March 31, 1998, awarded the Team $1,200 in unreimbursed costs. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed in July 1999 and remanded the case back to the trial court to determine whether the Team was in fact in default. On August 31, 2001, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a decision after trial upholding the governments default termination of the A-12 contract. In 2003, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, finding that the trial court had applied the wrong legal standard, vacated the trial courts 2001 decision and ordered the case sent back to the trial court for further proceedings. On May 3, 2007, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a decision upholding the governments default termination of the A-12 contract. We filed a Notice of Appeal on May 4, 2007 with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On June 2, 2009, the Court of Appeals rendered an opinion affirming the trial courts 2007 decision sustaining the governments default termination. On May 23, 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Court of Appeals upholding the default termination, and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals. On July 7, 2011, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the trial court for additional factual determinations and the trial court heard oral argument on May 7, 2013.  On December 29, 2009, the Navy sent letters to the Team requesting payment of $1,352 in unliquidated progress payments, plus applicable interest. On November 15, 2011, the Navy sent a letter confirming that it would not pursue payment from the Team pending all trial court and appellate proceedings adjudicating the issues remanded by the Supreme Court. On May 17, 2013, the President's Fiscal 2014 Budget Request to Congress included a new Department of Defense General Provision that would authorize the Secretary of the Navy to receive and retain payment in-kind in settlement of the A-12 aircraft litigation. On July 30, 2013, the Team and the Navy executed a settlement agreement that took effect upon enactment of the authorization legislation on December 26, 2013. The parties signed a contract modification effectuating the settlement on January 13, 2014 and, on January 23, 2014, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal with the court, voluntarily dismissing the litigation with prejudice. As a result, the Company recorded a $406 pre-tax charge in 2013, which consists of writing-off A-12 inventory, recorded as cost of sales, and providing three EA-18G Growlers at no cost to the U.S. Navy, recorded as a reduction in revenues. Employment, Labor and Benefits Litigation In connection with the 2005 sale of our former Wichita facility to Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. (Spirit), certain individuals not hired by Spirit alleged that Spirits hiring decisions following the sale were tainted by age discrimination, violated ERISA , violated our collective bargaining agreements, and constituted retaliation. The case was brought in 2006 as a class action on behalf of individuals not hired by Spirit. In 2012, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's 2010 summary judgment in favor of Boeing and Spirit on all class action claims, but the parties were not precluded from making claims on an individual basis. As of December 31, 2013, eighty-eight individual claims related to this matter were pending. Spirit has agreed to indemnify Boeing for any and all losses. Also related to the 2005 sale of the former Wichita facility, on February 16, 2007, an action entitled Harkness et al. v. The Boeing Company et al. was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, alleging collective bargaining agreement breaches and ERISA violations in connection with alleged failures to provide benefits to certain former employees of the Wichita facility. On December 11, 2012 the court denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granted Boeings motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs claim that amendment of The Boeing Company Employee Retirement Plan violated the IAM collective bargaining agreement, as well as individual ERISA 510 claims for interference with benefits. The court denied Boeings motion for all other claims. The parties are conducting additional discovery in anticipation of further court proceedings, which have not yet been scheduled. We believe that Spirit is obligated to indemnify Boeing for any and all losses in this matter, although to date Spirit has acknowledged a limited indemnification obligation. We currently estimate that the putative class includes 2,000 former Wichita employees. We cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from both these matters given the current procedural status of the litigation. On October 13, 2006, we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. Plaintiffs, seeking to represent a class of similarly situated participants and beneficiaries in The Boeing Company Voluntary Investment Plan (the VIP), alleged that fees and expenses incurred by the VIP were and are unreasonable and excessive, not incurred solely for the benefit of the VIP and its participants, and were undisclosed to participants. The plaintiffs further alleged that defendants breached their fiduciary duties in violation of 502(a)(2) of ERISA , and sought injunctive and equitable relief pursuant to 502(a)(3) of ERISA . During the first quarter of 2010, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted a stay of trial proceedings in the district court pending resolution of an appeal made by Boeing in 2008 to the cases class certification order. On January 21, 2011, the Seventh Circuit reversed the district courts class certification order and decertified the class. The Seventh Circuit remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. On September 19, 2013, the district court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification. On October 3, 2013, Boeing filed a petition for review of the class certification order with the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which was denied by the Seventh Circuit on November 26, 2013. Summary judgment briefs were filed in the district court on January 6, 2014, and plaintiffs opposition briefs were filed on February 10, 2013. We cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter given the current procedural status of the litigation. Note 21  Segment Information We operate in five principal segments: Commercial Airplanes; Boeing Military Aircraft ( BMA ), Network  Space Systems ( NSS ), and Global Services  Support ( GSS ), collectively Defense, Space  Security ; and Boeing Capital . All other activities fall within the Other segment or Unallocated items and eliminations. See page 54 for the Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note. The Commercial Airplanes segment develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft and provides related support services, principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide. Our BMA segment is engaged in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems for global strike, including fighter aircraft and missile systems; vertical lift including rotorcraft and tilt-rotor aircraft; mobility, surveillance and engagement, including command and control, battle management, airborne, anti-submarine, transport and tanker aircraft.

Note 23  Subsequent Event In January 2014, employees represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 (IAM 751) voted to extend our collective bargaining agreement to September 2024. Under the terms of the agreement, IAM 751-represented employees accrued pension benefits will immediately vest and in November 2016 these employees will transition to a company-funded retirement savings plan in lieu of participation in the defined benefit pension plan. IAM 751-represented employees hired on or after January 3, 2014 will be immediately covered by the company-funded retirement savings plan. The defined benefit pension plan changes will be accounted for as a curtailment in the first quarter of 2014 and are expected to result in a non-cash charge of approximately $140 and a reduction to our overall pension liability of approximately $130 . REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Boeing Company Chicago, Illinois We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 . The financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 14, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP  Chicago, Illinois February 14, 2014  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Boeing Company Chicago, Illinois We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 of the Company and our report dated February 14, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.  /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP  Chicago, Illinois February 14, 2014  ", "9A": " Item 9A.

Financial and Other Business Information See the Summary of Business Segment Data and Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information, including revenues and earnings from operations, for each of our business segments. Intellectual Property We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. Non-U.S. Revenues See Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding non-U.S. revenues. Research and Development Research and development expenditures involve experimentation, design, development and related test activities for defense systems, new and derivative jet aircraft including both commercial and military, advanced space and other company-sponsored product development. These are expensed as incurred including amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on U.S. government contracts. Our total research and development expense, net amounted to $3.0 billion , $3.1 billion and $3.3 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Research and development costs also include bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services, as well as costs incurred in excess of amounts estimated to be recoverable under cost-sharing research and development agreements. Bid and proposal costs were $289 million , $285 million and $326 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Employees Total workforce level at December 31, 2014 was approximately 165,500 . As of December 31, 2014 , our principal collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions: ##TABLE_START Union Percent of our Employees Represented Status of the Agreements with Major Union The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) 21% We have two major agreements; one expiring in June 2022 and one in September 2024. The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) 13% We have two major agreements expiring in October 2016. The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) 1% We have one major agreement expiring in September 2015 and one in October 2022. ##TABLE_ENDCompetition The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as Airbus, Embraer and Bombardier, and other entrants from Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with greater value products, services, and support. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which spans the life cycle of the airplane: aircraft acquisition, readying for service, maintenance and engineering, enhancing and upgrading, and transitioning to the next model - as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. BDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company and General Dynamics Corporation. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group, continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In addition, certain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2015 . Regulatory Matters Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our international markets. Government Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default, based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default. Commercial Aircraft. In the U.S., our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Internationally, similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Joint Aviation Authorities. Environmental. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations. A Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site for which we were originally assigned a partial share, the statutory framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. International. Our international sales are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, investment, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. International sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks. Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take one year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of companies. Suppliers We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and program/contract profitability, thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. We are also dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices. Seasonality No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report. Our Commercial Airplanes business depends heavily on commercial airlines, and is subject to unique risks. Market conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft. The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. In addition, availability of financing to non-U.S. customers depends in part on the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally, or in the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period. We enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. In order to account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers. Our Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards. The commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers, highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy regulatory and customer requirements, and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. We must meet planned production rate and productivity improvement targets in order to satisfy customer demand and maintain our profitability. We continue to increase production rates for the 737 and 787 programs, while at the same time engaging in significant ongoing development of the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X aircraft. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements, and optimizing how we manage inventory. If production rate ramp-up efforts at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer. Operational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins. Our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory certifications, could result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support costs. Further, if we cannot efficiently and cost-effectively incorporate design changes into already-completed 787 production aircraft, we may face further profitability pressures on this program. If our commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly and technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues. Changes in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the U.S. DoD . Levels of U.S. defense spending in future periods are very difficult to predict and subject to significant risks. In addition, significant budgetary delays and constraints have already resulted in reduced spending levels, and additional reductions may be forthcoming. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act (The Act) established limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending by approximately $490 billion between the 2012 and 2021 U.S. government fiscal years. The Act also provided that the defense budget would face sequestration cuts of up to an additional $500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded. The impact of sequestration cuts was reduced with respect to FY2014 and FY2015 following the enactment of The Bipartisan Budget Act in December 2013. However, significant uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure, including risk of future sequestration cuts. In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies (including NASA) within the overall budgetary framework described above. While the FY2015 appropriations enacted December 2014 included funding for Boeings major programs, such as F/A-18, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, KC-46A Tanker and P-8 programs, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in FY2016 and beyond will affect Boeings programs. We also expect that ongoing concerns regarding the U.S. national debt will continue to place downward pressure on U.S. DoD spending levels. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorizations and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. In addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both U.S. defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment, we expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. If we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition priorities and/or fail to meet affordability targets set by the U.S. DoD customer, our revenues and market share would be further impacted. We conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks. In 2014 ,  30% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign military sales through the U.S. government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks. Our sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs. New procurement regulations, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our compliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS business. These requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could be subject to additional costs in the form of withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply with these requirements in the future. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as continuing resolutions rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position. We are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S. government contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, routinely audit government contractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false. We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns. Our BDS business generated approximately 71% of its 2014 revenues from fixed-price contracts. While fixed price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. For example, during the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $425 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract, primarily due to initial engineering and design issues. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance. Fixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include AEWC , Commercial Crew, India P-8I, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker , and commercial and military satellites. We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks. Our BDS business generated approximately 29% of its 2014 revenues from cost-type contracting arrangements. Some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Programs whose contracts are primarily cost-type include GMD , Proprietary and SLS programs. We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks. Contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit payments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite does not perform to specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance. The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees we ultimately expect to realize is recognized as revenue in the construction period. If the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criteria, customers will not be obligated to continue making in-orbit payments and/or we may be required to provide refunds to the customer and incur significant charges. Our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components. We rely on other companies including subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies, and production commodities and to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers or incur additional costs. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum, titanium or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the suppliers control, such as geo-political developments, or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs. For example, we are monitoring political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results. Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. With respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling and other non-recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes to price escalation indices, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer and supplier negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact these estimates. Any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under Managements Discussion and Analysis  Critical Accounting Policies  Contract Accounting/Program Accounting on pages 43  44 and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 54  64 of this Form 10-K. Competition within our markets may reduce our future contracts and sales. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasing competition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers and service providers in one or more of our market segments. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation and new priorities, including long-term cost competitiveness, of our U.S. DoD customer will intensify competition for many of our products and services. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not result in reduced revenues and market share. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries. In 2014 , non-U.S. customers accounted for approximately 58% of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including: ##TABLE_START  changes in regulatory requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  domestic and international government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  fluctuations in international currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  volatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  imposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international conflicts. ##TABLE_END While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future. The outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. We are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the United States and its various states, as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S. government, the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our ownership of certain property. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers based in the United States, and in certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks. A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions, particularly in the United States. Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 aircraft. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position could be materially adversely affected. We may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , our airplane financing commitments totaled $16,723 million and $17,987 million . If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures. As part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful. We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures. We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. We maintain insurance for certain risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. government. The amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft technologies, missile systems, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims or liabilities. Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses. Our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. Any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of our data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and of our products and services. Some of our and our suppliers workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages. Approximately 64,000 employees, which constitute 39% of our total workforce, were union represented as of December 31, 2014 . We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BMA program production. We may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 11 U.S. labor organizations and 6 non-U.S. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions requirements without impacting our financial condition. The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations. We have substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders ' equity and cash flows from operations and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods. We have qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover the majority of our employees. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and discretionary contributions to improve the plans ' funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions  could have a significant effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders ' equity. For U.S. government contracts, we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. We also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the level of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see  Management ' s Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies - Pension Plans  on pages 45  46 of this Form 10-K. Although GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement benefit contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or past manufacturing operations or the operations of companies we have acquired. In other cases, we may become subject to such costs due to an indemnification agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental liabilities. In addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation requirements could result in additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Unauthorized access to our or our customers information and systems could negatively impact our business. We face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address these threats. While these measures are designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems, certain types of attacks, including cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information technology systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we cannot prevent the unauthorized access, release and/or corruption of our customers confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or we could face financial losses.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in many countries and rely on an extensive network of international partners, key suppliers and subcontractors. Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses  Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space  Security (BDS)  supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands and we price our products and services to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. Commercial Airplanes is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits us as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets sometimes offset. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers. Consolidated Results of Operations Earnings From Operations and Core Operating Earnings (Non-GAAP) The following table summarizes key indicators of consolidated results of operations: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except per share data)      Years ended December 31,   Revenues $90,762  $86,623  $81,698       GAAP      Earnings from operations 7,473  6,562  6,290 Operating margins 8.2 %  7.6 %  7.7 % Effective income tax rate 23.7 %  26.4 %  34.0 % Net earnings $5,446  $4,585  $3,900 Diluted earnings per share $7.38  $5.96  $5.11       Non-GAAP (1)      Core operating earnings $8,860  $7,876  $7,189 Core operating margin 9.8 %  9.1 %  8.8 % Core earnings per share $8.60  $7.07  $5.88 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) These measures exclude certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense.

Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $7,009 million primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries. BDS revenues decreased by $2,316 million due to lower revenues in all three segments. Revenues in 2013 increased by $4,925 million or 6% compared with 2012. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $3,854 million due to higher new airplane deliveries. BDS revenues increased by $590 million due to higher revenues in the Network  Space Systems ( NSS ) and Global Services  Support ( GSS ) segments, partially offset by lower revenues in the Boeing Military Aircraft ( BMA ) segment. The change in unallocated items, eliminations and other in 2014, 2013 and 2012 primarily reflects the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries. Earnings From Operations The following table summarizes Earnings from operations: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Commercial Airplanes $6,411  $5,795  $4,711 Defense, Space  Security 3,133  3,235  3,068 Boeing Capital   Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense (1,387 )  (1,314 )  (899 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations (776 )  (1,261 )  (678 ) Earnings from operations (GAAP) $7,473  $6,562  $6,290 Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense 1,387  1,314  Core operating earnings (Non-GAAP) $8,860  $7,876  $7,189 ##TABLE_ENDEarnings from operations in 2014  increased by $911 million compared with 2013 primarily reflecting higher earnings at Commercial Airplanes of $616 million and lower unallocated items and eliminations of $485 million . The decrease in unallocated items is due to the A-12 litigation settlement of $406 million which was recorded in 2013 and lower 2014 deferred compensation of $194 million . Earnings from operations in 2013 increased by $272 million compared with 2012. Commercial Airplanes earnings increased by $1,084 million primarily reflecting higher new airplane deliveries and lower research and development expense. BDS earnings increased by $167 million due to higher earnings in the NSS and BMA segments partially offset by lower earnings in the GSS segment. Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense in 2013 reduced earnings by $415 million compared with 2012 due to higher unallocated pension expense offset by lower unallocated other postretirement expense. Other unallocated items and eliminations in 2013 reduced earnings by $583 million primarily due to a charge recorded in 2013 related to the settlement of the A-12 aircraft litigation and higher 2013 deferred compensation expense. The A-12 aircraft litigation settlement resulted in the Company recording a $406 million pre-tax charge in 2013, which consisted of writing-off A-12 inventory, recorded as cost of sales, and providing three EA-18G Growlers at no cost to the U.S. Navy, recorded as a reduction in revenues. Core operating earnings in 2014  increased by $984 million compared with 2013 primarily reflecting higher earnings at Commercial Airplanes and the 2013 A-12 charge. Core operating earnings in 2013 increased by $687 million compared with 2012 as higher earnings at Commercial Airplanes and BDS more than offset the A-12 charge and higher 2013 deferred compensation expense. Unallocated Items, Eliminations and Other The most significant items included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other are shown in the following table: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Share-based plans ($67 )  ($95 )  ($81 ) Deferred compensation (44 )  (238 )  (75 ) Eliminations and other (665 )  (522 )  (643 ) Litigation settlements  (406 )  Sub-total (included in core operating earnings*) (776 )  (1,261 )  (678 ) Pension (1,469 )  (1,374 )  (787 ) Postretirement   (112 ) Pension and other postretirement benefit expense (excluded from core operating earnings*) (1,387 )  (1,314 )  (899 ) Total unallocated items, eliminations and other ($2,163 )  ($2,575 )  ($1,577 ) ##TABLE_END* Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense. See page 42 . Deferred compensation expense decreased by $194 million in 2014 and increased by $163 million in 2013, primarily driven by changes in our stock price. Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $143 million in 2014 decreased by $121 million in 2013 primarily due to insurance recoveries which were recorded in the third quarter of 2013. Litigation settlements include the 2013 charge of $406 million related to the settlement of the A-12 litigation and the $121 million benefit recorded in 2012 due to a favorable court judgment on satellite litigation. Net periodic benefit cost related to pension and other postretirement benefits totaled $2,483 million , $3,769 million and $3,383 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The decrease in 2014 net periodic benefit cost related to pension is primarily due to lower amortization of actuarial losses due to higher discount rates which more than offset higher 2014 curtailment charges. The increase in 2013 is primarily due to higher amortization of actuarial losses and higher service costs driven by lower discount rates. Unallocated pension expense in 2014 reflects pension charges of $395 million , primarily for pension curtailment costs. See Note 14 . The unallocated pension expense in 2013 reflects a pension curtailment charge of $73 million related to the decision in September 2013 to end production of the C-17 aircraft in 2015. See Note 11 . During the third quarter of 2013 we also determined that the pension expense in prior years was overstated and recorded a reduction in pension expense of $63 million. A portion of net periodic benefit cost is recognized in Earnings from operations in the period incurred and the remainder is included in inventory at the end of the reporting period and recorded in Earnings from operations in subsequent periods. Costs are allocated to the business segments as described in Note 21 . Net periodic benefit costs included in Earnings from operations were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits Years ended December 31,      Allocated to business segments ($1,746 )  ($1,662 )  ($1,620 )  ($369 )  ($413 )  ($431 ) Unallocated items, eliminations and other (1,469 )  (1,374 )  (787 )    (112 ) Total ($3,215 )  ($3,036 )  ($2,407 )  ($287 )  ($353 )  ($543 ) ##TABLE_ENDOther Earnings Items ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Earnings from operations $7,473  $6,562  $6,290 Other income, net (3 )   Interest and debt expense (333 )  (386 )  (442 ) Earnings before income taxes 7,137  6,232  5,910 Income tax expense (1,691 )  (1,646 )  (2,007 ) Net earnings from continuing operations $5,446  $4,586  $3,903 ##TABLE_ENDInterest and debt expense decreased by $53 million in 2014 and $56 million in 2013 as a result of lower weighted average debt balances. Our effective income tax rates were 23.7% , 26.4% and 34.0% for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Our 2014 effective tax rate was lower than 2013 primarily due to tax benefits of $265 million related to tax basis adjustments and $259 million related to audit settlements, both recorded in the second quarter of 2014. Our 2013 effective tax rate was lower than 2012 due to research tax credits for the 2013 and 2012 tax years that were both recorded in 2013 and the issuance of research and experimental regulations which resulted in $212 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits being recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Total Costs and Expenses (Cost of Sales) Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales and BDS predominantly uses contract accounting. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. Under contract accounting, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. The following table summarizes cost of sales: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,  Change   Change Cost of sales $76,752  $73,268 $3,484  $73,268  $68,665 $4,603 Cost of sales as a % of revenues 84.6 %  84.6 % 0.0 %  84.6 %  84.0 % 0.6 % ##TABLE_ENDCost of sales in 2014  increased by $3,484 million , or 5% compared with the same period in 2013 , primarily driven by the increase in revenue. Cost of sales at Commercial Airplanes increased by $6,265 million , or 14% , primarily driven by the 13% increase in revenues. Cost of sales at BDS  decreased by $2,085 million , or 8% primarily due to the 7% reduction in revenues. Cost of sales increased in 2013 by $4,603 million, or 7% compared with the prior year primarily driven by the 6% increase in revenues and higher unallocated pension and other postretirement costs. Cost of sales at Commercial Airplanes increased by $2,957 million, or 7%, primarily driven by the 8% increase in revenues and cost of sales at BDS increased by $407 million, primarily driven by the 2% increase in revenues. Research and Development The following table summarizes our Research and development expense: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Commercial Airplanes $1,881  $1,807  $2,049 Defense, Space  Security 1,158  1,215  1,189 Other   Total $3,047  $3,071  $3,298 ##TABLE_ENDResearch and development expense in 2014  decreased by $24 million compared to 2013 . Commercial Airplanes spending increased on 777X, 787-10 and 737 MAX partially offset by lower spending on the 787-9. Research and development expense in 2013 decreased by $227 million compared to 2012 primarily due to lower spending at Commercial Airplanes on the 787 program partially offset by increased spending on the 737 MAX and 777X. Backlog Our backlog at December 31 was as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)   Contractual Backlog:      Commercial Airplanes $440,118  $372,980  $317,287 Defense, Space  Security:      Boeing Military Aircraft 21,143  23,604  27,898 Network  Space Systems 8,935  9,832  10,078 Global Services  Support 16,896  16,245  17,092 Total Defense, Space  Security 46,974  49,681  55,068 Total contractual backlog $487,092  $422,661  $372,355 Unobligated backlog $15,299  $18,267  $17,873 ##TABLE_ENDContractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog at December 31, 2014 compared with December 31, 2013 was primarily due to commercial airplane orders and reclassifications from unobligated backlog related to incremental funding. The increase was partially offset by commercial airplane deliveries and revenues recognized on awarded contracts . The increase in contractual backlog during 2013 was primarily due to commercial aircraft orders in excess of deliveries partially offset by cancellation of orders. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The unobligated backlog at December 31, 2014 decreased from December 31, 2013 primarily due to reclassifications to contractual backlog related to incremental funding for BDS contracts, partially offset by contract awards. The unobligated backlog increased during 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to CH-47 Chinook and V-22 Osprey multi-year contract awards. The increase was partially offset by reclassifications to contractual backlog related to incremental funding for the U.S. Air Force KC-46A Tanker and F-15 multi-year contracts. Additional Considerations KC-46A Tanker In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force ( USAF ) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. This contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. During the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $425 million on this contract. $238 million of this loss was recorded at our Commercial Airplanes segment and the remaining $187 million was recorded in our BMA segment. The reach-forward loss was primarily due to initial engineering and design issues discovered during systems installation that are requiring rework and additional engineering and manufacturing labor to complete this contract. To date the program has met all customer contractual milestones. This contract contains production options. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. The USAF is scheduled to authorize low rate initial production in 2015 subject to satisfactory progress being made on the development contract. Russia/Ukraine We continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. A number of our commercial customers also have operations in Russia and Ukraine. To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to production or deliveries. Should suppliers or customers experience disruption, our production and/or deliveries could be materially impacted. Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment Global economic activity and global trade, which are the primary drivers of the demand for air travel, grew below the long-term average for the third year in a row in 2014. Despite this, passenger traffic grew from 5% to 6% annually between 2012 and 2014 and is forecasted to continue above the long-term trend of 5% in 2015. There continues to be significant variation between regions and airline business models, with airlines operating in emerging economies and low-cost-carriers leading growth. Air cargo traffic grew at close to long-term average rates in 2014, with continued improvement projected in 2015. In addition, capacity metrics such as load factors and freighter aircraft utilization are showing signs of improvement. The relative weakness of the air cargo market in recent years has impacted near-term demand for new freighter aircraft and freighter conversions. We continue to closely monitor the impact of this trend on our business. Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also relentlessly focusing on reducing costs by renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airplanes. Net profits for the global airline industry are estimated to total $20 billion in 2014 compared to $11 billion in 2013. Together with strong demand growth, we expect lower oil prices will improve airline profitability in 2015. The long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast is for a long-term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger and cargo traffic, based on a projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long-term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $5.2 trillion market for approximately 37,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global environmental regulations. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia is enabling low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 11% of Commercial Airplanes contractual backlog, in dollar terms, is with U.S. airlines, including cargo carriers. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft in the market above 90 seats. Many of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including launch aid, which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airplane development activities and enables airplanes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. Changes in value of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies impact competitors revenues and profits. Competitors routinely respond to a relatively weaker U.S. dollar by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer-term competitive posture. Competitors can use the improved efficiency to fund product development, gain market share through pricing and/or improve earnings. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spare parts, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively. Many of our non-U.S. customers finance aircraft purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. In September 2014, the banks charter was extended and is now set to expire on June 30, 2015. If the banks charter is not renewed or if the banks existing or future funding authority is insufficient to meet our customers needs, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. Certain of our non-U.S. customers also may seek to delay aircraft purchases if they cannot obtain financing at reasonable costs. We continue to work with our customers to mitigate risks to the timing of future deliveries and are assisting with alternative third party financing sources.

Commercial Airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  *     Total            Cumulative deliveries 5,218  1,501  1,067  1,263    Deliveries (15)  (3)     2013            Cumulative deliveries 4,733  1,482  1,061  1,164    Deliveries (8)     (1)  2012            Cumulative deliveries 4,293  1,458  1,040  1,066    Deliveries (9)     (3)  ##TABLE_END* Intercompany deliveries identified by parentheses ##TABLE_START  Aircraft accounted for as revenues by Commercial Airplanes and as operating leases in consolidation identified by parentheses ##TABLE_END Earnings From Operations  Earnings from operations in 2014  increased by $616 million or 11% compared with 2013 . The increase in earnings is primarily due to higher earnings of $947 million driven by higher new airplane deliveries and commercial aviation services revenue growth. This earnings increase was partially offset by a reach-forward loss of $238 million recorded in the second quarter of 2014 related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract and higher research and development expense of $74 million . The increase in research and development reflects higher spending on the 777X, 787-10 and 737 MAX, which more than offset lower 787-9 spending. Operating margins decreased from 10.9% in 2013 to 10.7% in 2014 primarily due to the dilutive impact of 747 and 787 deliveries and the USAF KC-46A Tanker reach-forward loss. Earnings from operations in 2013 increased by $1,084 million or 23% compared with 2012. The increase in earnings is primarily driven by higher new airplane deliveries of $842 million and lower research and development expense of $242 million due to lower spending on the 787 program partially offset by higher spending on the 737 MAX and 777X. Operating margins increased from 9.6% in 2012 to 10.9% in 2013 primarily due to higher deliveries and lower research and development expense partially offset by the dilutive impact of 787 deliveries. Backlog  Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their Board of Directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers. The increase in contractual backlog during 2014 was due to orders in excess of deliveries partially reduced by cancellation of orders. The increase in contractual backlog during 2013 was due to orders in excess of deliveries partially reduced by cancellation of orders and changes in projected revenue escalation. The decrease in unobligated backlog during 2014 and 2013 was due to the reclassification from unobligated to contractual backlog related to incremental funding of the existing multi-year contract for Commercial Airplanes share of the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a programs life. Estimation of each programs accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. ##TABLE_START  Program      777X  2014            Program accounting quantities 7,800  1,574  1,113  1,600  *  1,300 Undelivered units under firm orders 4,299      Cumulative firm orders 9,517  1,537  1,114  1,541   1,071            Program accounting quantities 7,000  1,574  1,113  1,550  *  1,300 Undelivered units under firm orders 3,680      Cumulative firm orders 8,413  1,537  1,110  1,478   1,030            Program accounting quantities 6,600  1,574  1,103  1,450    1,100 Undelivered units under firm orders 3,074       Cumulative firm orders 7,367  1,525  1,108  1,431    ##TABLE_END* The accounting quantity for the 777X will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020. Program Highlights 737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 800 units during 2014 due to the program  s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The accounting quantity includes NG and MAX units. We increased our production rate from 38 to 42 per month in the second quarter of 2014 and plan an additional increase to 47 per month in 2017. On October 2, 2014 we announced our plan to further increase the rate to 52 per month in 2018. First delivery of the 737 MAX is expected in 2017. 747 Program Lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft has resulted in ongoing pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated. We are currently producing at a rate of 1.5 per month with plans to reduce the rate to 1.3 per month in September 2015. We have a number of unsold 747 production positions and remain focused on obtaining additional orders and implementing cost-reduction efforts. If market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, the program could face a reach-forward loss that may be material. 767 Program The 767 assembly line includes a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. In October 2014 we increased our combined tanker and commercial production rate from 1 to 1.5 per month and plan to increase to 2 per month in 2016. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 50 units during 2014 due to the programs normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 8.3 per month. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we launched the 777X, which features a new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips. The 777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020. 787 Program During the second quarter of 2014 we completed initial type certification for the 787-9 and received design and production certifications. We delivered the first 787-9 airplane in June 2014. First delivery of the 787-10 derivative aircraft is targeted for 2018. We are producing at a rate of 10 per month and the first delivery at this rate occurred in March 2014. We remain focused on stabilizing 787 production rates at 10 per month while improving aircraft reliability and satisfying customer mission and performance requirements. We continue to monitor and address challenges associated with aircraft production and assembly, including management of our manufacturing operations and extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work, incorporating changes identified during 787-8 flight testing to already completed aircraft, as well as the incorporation of the 787-9 derivative into the manufacturing process. In addition, we continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes, including requests for contractual relief related to delivery delays and supplier assertions. During 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs associated with these airplanes were included in research and development expense. Based on sales activity and market interest we continue to believe that the remaining 787 flight-test aircraft are commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to these aircraft in program inventory. If we determine that any of the remaining flight-test aircraft cannot be sold, we may incur additional charges related to the reclassification of costs associated with those aircraft to research and development expense. The accounting quantity of 1,300 units remains unchanged and reflects the incorporation of revenue and cost estimates associated with the 787-10 and planned production rate increases to 12 and 14 per month in future years. The combination of production challenges, change incorporation, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts has created significant pressure on program profitability. If risks related to these challenges, together with risks associated with planned production rate increases or introducing the 787-10 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions, further pressures on program profitability and/or a reach-forward loss. We continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks. Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. Program Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. Reflects models in development during 2014 We launched the 787-10 in June 2013 and the 777X in November 2013. Additional Considerations The development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Defense, Space  Security Business Environment and Trends United States Government Defense Environment Overview U.S. government appropriation levels remain subject to significant uncertainty. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act (The Act) established limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending by approximately $490 billion between the 2012 and 2021 U.S. government fiscal years. The Act also provided that the defense budget would face sequestration cuts of up to an additional $500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded. While the impact of sequestration cuts was reduced with respect to FY2014 and FY2015 following the enactment of The Bipartisan Budget Act in December 2013, significant uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending. It is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels for FY2016 and beyond will continue to be subject to significant pressure, including risk of future sequestration cuts. Significant uncertainty also continues with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense ( U.S. DoD ) and other government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorization and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. In addition to the risks described above, if Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner, a government shutdown could result which could have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts or sequestration impacts. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. DoD or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 enacted December 2014, funds most U.S. government agencies through September 2015, including the U.S. DoD , National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). International Environment Overview The international market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories, while faced with constrained budgets. In Europe, the continuing financial challenges are forcing governments to institute austerity measures negatively impacting defense spending in the near term. The strongest opportunities for BDS in 2015 will be the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions where the relative financial strength of these economies, coupled with a broad spectrum of evolving threats, are expected to result in procurement of defense and security systems. BDS Realignment Effective during the first quarter of 2014 , certain programs were realigned between BDS segments. The realignments include certain BMA aircraft and modernization programs which were moved to GSS . Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. See Note 21 .

In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Deliveries of units for new-build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   F/A-18 Models   F-15 Models   C-17 Globemaster III   CH-47 Chinook   AH-64 Apache   P-8 Models   AEWC    C-40A  Total new-build production aircraft   ##TABLE_ENDRevenues  BDS revenues in 2014  decreased by $2,316 million compared with 2013 primarily due to lower revenues of $1,774 million in the BMA segment and lower revenues of $509 million in the NSS segment. BDS revenues in 2013 increased by $590 million compared with 2012 due to higher revenues of $601 million  and $92 million in the NSS and GSS segments, partially offset by lower revenues of $103 million in the BMA segment. Earnings From Operations  BDS earnings from operations in 2014  decreased by $102 million compared with 2013 due to lower earnings of $200 million and $21 million in the BMA and NSS segments, partially offset by higher earnings of $119 million in the GSS  segment. Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $96 million  higher in 2014 compared with 2013 , primarily reflecting higher favorable adjustments in the GSS segment. BDS earnings from operations in 2013 increased by $167 million compared with 2012 due to higher earnings of $157 million and $17 million in the NSS and BMA segments, partially offset by lower earnings of $7 million in the GSS segment.  Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $137 million lower in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily reflecting lower favorable adjustments in the GSS and BMA segments. Backlog Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. BDS total backlog was $61,913 million at December 31, 2014 , reflecting a decrease of 8% from December 31, 2013 . BDS total backlog was $67,288 million at December 31, 2013 , reflecting a decrease of 6% from December 31, 2012. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional Considerations Our BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense ( GMD ), Proprietary and Space Launch System ( SLS ) programs. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Airborne Early Warning and Control ( AEWC ), India P-8I, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew and commercial and military satellites.

BMA revenues in 2013 decreased by $103 million compared with 2012 primarily due to a reduction of $1,320 million related to fewer deliveries of AEWC aircraft to Australia and the Republic of Korea and customer and delivery mix for the F/A-18 and C-17 programs. This reduction was partially offset by an increase of $1,168 million related to higher 2013 deliveries of P-8 aircraft and Apache rotorcraft, as well as non-recurring effort on several Chinook programs. Earnings From Operations  BMA earnings from operations in 2014  decreased by $200 million , or 13% , compared with 2013 primarily due to 2014 charges of $235 million and lower earnings of $73 million related to fewer deliveries on the C-17 program. The charges recorded in 2014 included $187 million related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract and $48 million to write off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of our 2014 decision to produce three fewer C-17 aircraft in 2015 than previously planned. See Note 11 . These decreases were partially offset by higher earnings of $65 million related to improved performance on the F/A-18 program. In addition, in 2013, we recorded a charge of $64 million to write off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of the Republic of Korea's announcement to restart its F-X fighter aircraft competition. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $39 million  lower in 2014 than in 2013 primarily driven by the reach-forward loss on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract, partially offset by higher favorable adjustments to the F/A-18 and F-15 programs. BMA earnings from operations in 2013 increased by $17 million compared with 2012 primarily due to increased deliveries and higher revenues on the P-8, Apache and Chinook programs of $263 million partially offset by lower earnings of $175 million related to initial revenues in 2012 on the Saudi F-15 program and lower C-17 performance. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $62 million  lower in 2013 than in 2012, primarily driven by less favorable adjustments to the F-15 program. In the third quarter of 2013, we decided to end production of C-17 aircraft in 2015. See Note 11. Also in the third quarter of 2013, we recorded a charge of $64 million to write off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of the Republic of Korea's announcement that it will restart its F-X fighter aircraft competition. Backlog BMA total backlog at December 31, 2014 was $29,173 million , a decrease of 13% reflecting revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by contract awards for the F/A-18, P-8 and Apache programs. BMA total backlog was $33,662 million at December 31, 2013, reflecting a decrease of 8% from December 31, 2012 primarily due to revenues recognized on F-15, F/A-18 and C-17 program contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by CH-47 Chinook and V-22 Osprey multi-year contract awards. Additional Considerations C-17 and F/A-18 See the discussion of the C-17 and F/A-18 programs in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

NSS revenues in 2013 increased by $601 million compared with 2012 primarily due to higher revenue of $364 million on the SLS program awarded in the fourth quarter of 2012 and higher revenues of $329 million on our commercial satellite programs. This increase was partially offset by lower revenues of $196 million on our EIS programs. New-build satellite deliveries were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Commercial and civil satellites   Military satellites   ##TABLE_ENDEarnings From Operations  NSS earnings from operations in 2014  decreased by $21 million compared with 2013 primarily due to lower earnings of $84 million on several commercial satellite programs related to lower milestone volume, partially offset by higher earnings of $68 million due to improved performance on several government satellite programs and our United Launch Alliance ( ULA ) joint venture as well as higher volume on Commercial Crew during the initial performance period. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $12 million  higher in 2014 than in 2013 . NSS earnings from operations in 2013  increased by $157 million or 28% compared with 2012 primarily due to higher revenues and mix in our civil and commercial satellite programs and the SLS program. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings from our United Space Alliance ( USA ) joint venture reflecting a gain of $39 million recorded in the third quarter of 2012 related to the termination and settlement of USA 's defined benefit pension plans. The impact of net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments was not significant in 2013. NSS earnings from operations include equity earnings of $211 million , $171 million and $180 million primarily from the ULA joint venture in 2014, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Backlog NSS total backlog was $14,922 million at December 31, 2014 , reflecting a decrease of 6% from December 31, 2013 primarily due to revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by current year contract awards for the Commercial Crew, commercial satellite and missile defense system programs. NSS total backlog was $15,908 at December 31, 2013, reflecting a decrease of 7% from December 31, 2012 primarily due to revenues recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by government and commercial satellite contract awards.

These decreases were partially offset by higher Maintenance, Modification and Upgrades ( MMU ) revenues of $245 million primarily related to deliveries of three AEWC Peace Eagle to Turkey in 2014. GSS revenues in 2013  increased by $92 million compared with 2012 primarily due to higher revenues on MMU and TSGS programs, partially offset by decreases in several IL programs. Earnings From Operations  GSS earnings from operations in 2014  increased by $119 million , or 12% , compared with 2013 primarily due to an increase of $145 million related to improved performance in several MMU programs, most notably the AEWC Peace Eagle contract. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $123 million  higher in 2014 than in 2013 primarily due to unfavorable adjustments on the AEWC Peace Eagle contract in 2013.  GSS earnings from operations in 2013 decreased by $7 million compared with 2012 primarily due to lower performance of $59 million in MMU on the AEWC Peace Eagle contract partially offset by $44 million of higher revenues and improved performance on several TSGS programs. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2013 were $90 million  lower than in 2012 primarily due to higher unfavorable adjustments on the AEWC Peace Eagle contract. Backlog GSS total backlog has remained consistent at $17,818 million , $17,718 million and $17,891 million at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Boeing Capital Business Environment and Trends BCCs gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2014 totaled $3,506 million . A substantial portion of BCCs portfolio is concentrated among certain U.S. commercial airline customers. BCCs portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably out-of-production Boeing aircraft such as 717 aircraft. BCC provided customer financing of $489 million and $220 million during 2014 and 2013 . While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2015, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,300 western-built commercial jet aircraft ( 9.8% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2014 , including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 15% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2013 and 2012 , 9.2% and 10.0% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. Results of Operations ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Revenues $416  $408  $468 Earnings from operations $92  $107  $88 Operating margins %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDRevenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and notes, and other income. BCC s revenues in 2014  increased by $8 million compared with 2013 primarily due to higher aircraft return condition payments of $60 million, partially offset by a decrease in finance lease income and lower interest income. BCCs revenues in 2013 decreased by $60 million compared with 2012 primarily due to lower other income driven by lower aircraft return condition payments and operating lease income. Earnings From Operations  BCCs earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2014  decreased by $ 15 million compared with 2013 due to $60 million increase in asset impairment expense, partially offset by a reduction in the provision for losses on receivables, driven by a change to a customer credit rating recorded in the first quarter of 2014, in addition to lower depreciation and interest expense. Earnings from operations in 2013 increased by $19 million compared with 2012 primarily due to lower depreciation expense and interest expense offset by lower revenues. Financial Position The following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Customer financing and investment portfolio, net $3,493  $3,883 Other assets, primarily cash and short-term investments  Total assets $4,108  $4,388     Other liabilities, primarily deferred income taxes $1,212  $1,296 Debt, including intercompany loans 2,412  2,577 Equity  Total liabilities and equity $4,108  $4,388     Debt-to-equity ratio 5.0-to-1  5.0-to-1 ##TABLE_ENDBCCs customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2014  decreased from December 31, 2013 primarily due to portfolio run-off, partially offset by the origination of notes receivable and equipment under operating lease totaling $489 million . At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , BCC had $48 million and $83 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $183 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2015 . We are seeking to remarket these aircraft or have the leases extended. BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment. On October 31, 2014, Boeing issued $850 million of fixed and floating rate notes and entered into a concurrent intercompany loan on the same terms with BCC for $550 million , comprised of $300 million of fixed rate notes and $250 million of floating rate notes. Interest expense associated with these intercompany notes is included in Boeing Capital interest expense. See Note 13 . Restructurings and Restructuring Requests From time to time, certain customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with BCC. During 2014 , BCC did not reach agreement on any restructuring requests that would have a material effect on our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position.

The increase of $0.7 billion in 2014 was primarily due to higher customer advances which more than offset higher gross inventory. The increase of $0.7 billion in 2013 was primarily due to increased customer receipts reflecting higher delivery and order volumes in 2013 . Our investment in gross inventories increased by $7.6 billion in 2014 , $5.7 billion in 2013 and $6.2 billion in 2012 , driven by continued investment in commercial airplane program inventory, primarily 787 inventory. Advances and progress billings increased by $6.9 billion in 2014 , $3.9 billion in 2013 and $1.9 billion in 2012 , primarily due to payments from commercial airplane customers. Discretionary contributions to our pension plans totaled $0.8 billion in 2014 compared with $1.5 billion in 2013 and $1.6 billion in 2012 . Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities was $2.5 billion during 2014 compared with $5.2 billion used during 2013 and $3.8 billion used during 2012 , largely due to changes in investments in time deposits. Net proceeds from investments were $4.8 billion in 2014 compared with net contributions to investments of $2.9 billion in 2013 and $2 billion in 2012 . In 2014 , capital expenditures totaled $2.2 billion , up from $2.1 billion in 2013 and $1.7 billion in 2012 . We expect capital expenditures to be higher in 2015 than 2014 due to continued investment to support growth. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $8.6 billion during 2014 , an increase of $4.3 billion compared with 2013 primarily due to higher share repurchases of $3.2 billion , higher dividends paid of $0.6 billion and a decrease in proceeds from stock options exercised of $0.8 billion in 2014 , partially offset by higher new borrowings of $0.4 billion in 2014 . Cash used by financing activities was $4.2 billion during 2013 , an increase of $0.8 billion compared with 2012 primarily due to share repurchases of $2.8 billion in 2013 partially offset by higher new borrowings of $0.5 billion , lower debt repayments of $0.6 billion and an increase in stock options exercised of $1.0 billion in 2013. During 2014 , we issued unsecured debt totaling $0.8 billion , of which $0.5 billion was used to fund the BCC segment, and we repaid $1.4 billion of unsecured debt, including repayments of $0.7 billion of debt held at BCC. At December 31, 2014 and 2013 the recorded balance of debt was $9.1 billion and $9.6 billion of which $0.9 billion and $1.6 billion was classified as short-term. This includes $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion of debt attributable to BCC , of which $0.1 billion and $0.7 billion was classified as short-term at December 31, 2014 and 2013 . During 2014 and 2013 we repurchased 46.6 million and 25.4 million shares totaling $6.0 billion and $2.8 billion through our open market share repurchase program. In 2014 and 2013 , we had 0.7 million and 0.8 million shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At December 31, 2014 , the amount available under the share repurchase plan, announced on December 15, 2014, totaled $12 billion . Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that continues to serve as a significant potential source of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2014 and at December 31, 2014 , we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $5.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. Financing commitments totaled $16.7 billion and $18.0 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013 . We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities. At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , our pension plans were $17.3 billion and $10.5 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. The increase in the liability primarily reflects the decrease in the discount rate used from 4.80% at December 31, 2013 to 3.90% at December 31, 2014 . See Note 14 . On an Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2014 with minimal required contributions in 2015 . We do not expect the contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans to be significant in 2015 . We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years. At December 31, 2014 , we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2014 , and the estimated timing thereof. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Total  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  3-5 years  After 5 years Long-term debt (including current portion) $8,950  $870  $1,356  $1,871  $4,853 Interest on debt (1) 5,387     3,427 Pension and other postretirement cash requirements 10,965   1,080  1,972  7,436 Capital lease obligations     Operating lease obligations 1,503     Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position 131,549  47,249  37,187  20,505  26,608 Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position 16,872  15,959    Total contractual obligations $175,395  $65,279  $41,773  $25,370  $42,973 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2014 . Variable rate debt was 3% of our total debt at December 31, 2014 . ##TABLE_END Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Approximately 4% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts. Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation. Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2014 , we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2014 , we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $17.8 billion that extend through 2030 . Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Income Tax Obligations As of December 31, 2014 , our net liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions, was $406 million . We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. Our income tax matters are excluded from the table above. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2014 . ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Total Amounts Committed/Maximum Amount of Loss  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  4-5 years  After 5 years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $3,985  $2,277  $1,658  $1  $49 Commercial aircraft financing commitments 16,723  2,552  7,207  4,043  2,921 Total commercial commitments $20,708  $4,829  $8,865  $4,044  $2,970 ##TABLE_ENDCommercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contingent Obligations We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $601 million at December 31, 2014 . For additional information, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We have $1,312 million of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2014 for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-GAAP Measures Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the impact of unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expenses which represent costs not attributable to business segments - see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts. Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures The table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of earnings from operations, operating margins and diluted earnings per share. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except per share data)    Years ended December 31,   Revenues $90,762  $86,623  $81,698 Earnings from operations, as reported $7,473  $6,562  $6,290 Operating margins 8.2 %  7.6 %  7.7 %       Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense $1,387  $1,314  $899 Core operating earnings (non-GAAP) $8,860  $7,876  $7,189 Core operating margins (non-GAAP) 9.8 %  9.1 %  8.8 %       Diluted earnings per share, as reported $7.38  $5.96  $5.11 Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense (1) $1.22  $1.11  $0.77 Core earnings per share (non-GAAP) $8.60  $7.07  $5.88 Weighted average diluted shares (in millions) 738.0  769.5  763.8 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Earnings per share impact is presented net of the federal statutory rate of 35.0%. ##TABLE_END Other Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Act), require disclosure of certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran that occurred during the period covered by this report. Disclosure is required even if the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. We have disclosed such activities in our Form 10-Q reports for the second and third quarter of 2014 and those disclosures are incorporated herein by reference. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we sold aeronautical navigation charts and data services to Iran Air. These sales were authorized by a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Boeing applied for the OFAC license consistent with guidance from the U.S. government in connection with ongoing negotiations between the P5+1 nations and Iran related to, among other things, the safety of Irans civil aviation industry. We generated approximately $190 thousand in gross revenues and $15 thousand net profits during the fourth quarter of 2014 from these sales. We may engage in additional sales pursuant to this license, which sales may require additional disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Act. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting Contract accounting is used to determine revenue, cost of sales, and profit predominantly by our BDS business. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contracts inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ending December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts increased Earnings from operations by $100 million , $242 million and $379 million , respectively. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS for all of 2014 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $309 million . In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower initial margins than established programs. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or other circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs for all of 2014 had been estimated to be lower by 1%, it would have increased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $520 million . If the combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs for all of 2014 (excluding the 747 and 787 programs which had gross margins that were breakeven or near breakeven during 2014 ) had been estimated to be higher by 1%, it would have decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $360 million . If we are unable to mitigate risks associated with the 747 and 787 programs, or if we are required to change one or more of our pricing, cost or other assumptions related to these programs, we could be required to record reach-forward losses which could have a material effect on our reported results. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any. We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2014 and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2014 , we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had $490 million and $497 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets. Pension Plans The majority of our employees are earning benefits under defined benefit pension plans through 2016. In 2014, we announced changes to our retirement plans whereby nonunion and the majority of union employees currently participating in defined benefit pension plans will transition in 2016 to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders equity. The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2014 . ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Change in discount rate Increase 25 bps  Change in discount rate Decrease 25 bps Pension plans    Projected benefit obligation ($2,449 )  $3,068 Net periodic pension cost (266 )  ##TABLE_ENDPension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2014 net periodic pension expense by $141 million . We expect 2015 net periodic pension cost to increase by approximately $367 million and the portion recognized in earnings to decrease by approximately $1,084 million primarily due to amortization of actuarial losses. ", "7A": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2014 , the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2014 , a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $237 million . Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. ", "8": " Item 8.

The Boeing Company and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012  (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as Boeing, the Company, we, us, or our). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Segment data for all years have been adjusted to reflect a realignment of certain programs from the Boeing Military Aircraft ( BMA ) segment to the Global Services  Support ( GSS ) segment and the combination of Other segment with Unallocated items and eliminations. See Note 21 . Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is not permitted. The comprehensive new standard will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance and require revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Adoption of the new rules could affect the timing of revenue recognition for certain transactions. The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards. For Boeing the new standard will be effective January 1, 2017 and the Company is currently evaluating the impacts of adoption and the implementation approach to be used. Use of Estimates Management makes assumptions and estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Those assumptions and estimates directly affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant estimates for which changes in the near term are considered reasonably possible and that may have a material impact on the financial statements are disclosed in these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Cycle For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year . Revenue and Related Cost Recognition Contract Accounting Contract accounting is used for development and production activities predominantly by Defense, Space  Security (BDS). The majority of business conducted by BDS is performed under contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that extend over several years. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales and costs for each contract resulting in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. When the current estimates of total sales and costs for a contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contracts percent complete. In 2014 , 2013 and 2012 net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts increased Earnings from operations by $100 , $242 and $379 , respectively and diluted EPS by $0.10 , $0.23 and $0.33 , respectively. Significant adjustments during the three years ended December 31, 2014 included a reach-forward loss of $425 on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract recorded during 2014. We combine contracts for accounting purposes when they are negotiated as a package with an overall profit margin objective. These essentially represent an agreement to do a single project for a single customer, involve interrelated construction activities with substantial common costs, and are performed concurrently or sequentially. When a group of contracts is combined, revenue and profit are earned uniformly over the performance of the combined contracts. Similarly, we may segment a single contract or group of contracts when a clear economic decision has been made during contract negotiations that would produce different rates of profitability for each element or phase of the contract. Sales related to fixed-price contracts are recognized as deliveries are made, except for certain fixed-price contracts that require substantial performance over an extended period before deliveries begin, for which sales are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones. Sales related to contracts in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if specified targets are achieved. Incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated and are probable are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded. Program Accounting Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales related to its programs. Program accounting is applicable to products manufactured for delivery under production-type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contracts and years. Under program accounting, inventoriable production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced, and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. We recognize sales for commercial airplane deliveries as each unit is completed and accepted by the customer. Sales recognized represent the price negotiated with the customer, adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. The amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effects on program margins are recognized prospectively except in cases where the program is determined to have a reach-forward loss in which case the loss is recognized in the current period. See Note 11 . Concession Sharing Arrangements We account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their purchase of products and services as a reduction to revenue when the related products and services are delivered. The sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendors products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products. Spare Parts Revenue We recognize sales of spare parts upon delivery and the amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost. Service Revenue Service revenue is recognized when the service is performed with the exception of U.S. government service agreements, which are accounted for using contract accounting. Service activities primarily include: support agreements associated with military aircraft and helicopter contracts, ongoing maintenance of International Space Station, and technical and flight operation services for commercial aircraft. Service revenue and associated cost of sales from pay-in-advance subscription fees are deferred and recognized as services are rendered. Financial Services Revenue We record financial services revenue associated with sales-type/finance leases, operating leases, and notes receivable. Lease and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type/finance leases, we record an asset at lease inception. This asset is recorded at the aggregate future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur. For operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets, included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated residual value, using the straight-line method. We periodically review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense. For notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note. Reinsurance Revenue Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Astro Ltd., participates in a reinsurance pool for workers compensation. The member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $135 , $160 and $129 during 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were $144 , $147 and $128 during 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Revenues and costs are presented net in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fleet Support We provide assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation to the operators of all our commercial airplane models. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, and technical consulting support. This activity continues throughout the aircrafts operational life. Services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire models fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services. Research and Development Research and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design, and testing, as well as bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers. Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with our contract accounting policy. We have certain research and development arrangements that meet the requirement for best efforts research and development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expense rather than as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of $289 , $285 and $326 in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. We have established cost sharing arrangements with some suppliers for the 787 program. Our cost sharing arrangements state that the supplier contributions are for reimbursements of costs we incur for experimentation, basic design, and testing activities during the 787 development. In each arrangement, we retain substantial rights to the 787 part or component covered by the arrangement. The amounts received from these cost sharing arrangements are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses since we have no obligation to refund any amounts received per the arrangements regardless of the outcome of the development efforts. Specifically, under the terms of each agreement, payments received from suppliers for their share of the costs are typically based on milestones and are recognized as earned when we achieve the milestone events and no ongoing obligation on our part exists. In the event we receive a milestone payment prior to the completion of the milestone, the amount is classified in Accrued liabilities until earned. Share-Based Compensation We provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value net of estimated forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. Income Taxes Provisions for federal, state, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Earnings before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. Tax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of Income tax expense. Postretirement Plans The majority of our employees are earning benefits under defined benefit pension plans. In 2014, we announced changes to our retirement plans whereby nonunion and the majority of union employees currently participating in defined benefit pension plans will transition in 2016 to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan. We also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employees annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). A portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and reflected in inventory at the end of a reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in Shareholders equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities we amortize them over the average future service period of employees. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Postemployment Plans We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated. Environmental Remediation We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations, and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup, and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be able to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable were $241 and $108 at December 31, 2014 and 2013 . Inventories Inventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe benefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries and plant services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costs include amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one year. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering. Commercial aircraft programs inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production costs represent actual costs incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costs are experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor and other resources) than units produced later in a program because of volume efficiencies and the effects of learning. We expect that these deferred costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive from suppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier advances are amortized to work in process. The determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision is recorded. The determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimate revenue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity. When estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. Used aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value. See Aircraft Valuation within this Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or market. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired inventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs. Included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the ability to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwise recoverable, it would be written off in the current period. We net advances and progress billings on long-term contracts against inventory in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Advances and progress billings in excess of related inventory are reported in Advances and billings in excess of related costs. Precontract Costs We may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recovery from future orders, then we capitalize the precontract costs we incur, excluding start-up costs which are expensed as incurred. Capitalized precontract costs are included in Inventories, net of advances and progress billings, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Should future orders not materialize or we determine the costs are no longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and equipment, from 3 to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over 5 years. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition. Long-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Long-lived assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Asset Retirement Obligations We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material. We also have known conditional asset retirement obligations, such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liabilitys fair value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1. We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology, from 5 to 14 years; product know-how, from 5 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 19 years; distribution rights, from 5 to 27 years; and other, from 3 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Investments Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost. The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between 20% and 50% . We classify investment income and loss on our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on whether the investment is operating or non-operating in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, including our share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from certain cost method investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic purposes. Earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on marketable securities, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in Other income/(expense), net. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them. We use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes in fair value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is to include in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For our cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss of a cash flow hedge is reported in earnings immediately. We also hold certain instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For these derivative instruments, the changes in their fair value are also recorded in earnings immediately. Aircraft Valuation Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments. Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of: ##TABLE_START (1) adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recognized upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) charges to cost of products for adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in Accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_END The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customers requirements; or the scrap market. Trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market. This quarterly valuation process yields results that are typically lower than residual value estimates by independent sources and tends to more accurately reflect results upon the actual placement of the aircraft. Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or market as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer financing. Customer financing Customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/finance leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary. We assess the fair value of the assets we own, including equipment under operating leases, assets held for sale or re-lease, and collateral underlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are less than the related assets carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fair values of sales-type/finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables. We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications. Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Allowance for losses on customer financing receivables We record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in a valuation account, the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to two components of receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables. We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the receivable agreement, without regard to any subsequent restructurings. Factors considered in assessing collectability include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. We determine a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral we would expect to realize. We review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables (after excluding receivables subject to a specific impairment allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for each customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, for example, permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall. Each quarter we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables. Warranties In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material and design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a three to four -year standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards under our authorization. These warranties are included in the programs estimate at completion. On occasion we have made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warranties issued by our BDS segments principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons hardware and are included in the contract cost estimates. These sales are generally accompanied by a six to twelve -month warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate. We provide guarantees to certain commercial airplane customers which include compensation provisions for failure to meet specified aircraft performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets, and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of the related aircraft. We have agreements that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to customers for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as a reduction in Cost of products at delivery of the related aircraft. These performance warranties and claims against suppliers are included in the programs estimate at completion. Supplier Penalties We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully anticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts. Guarantees We record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. For a residual value guarantee where we received a cash premium, the liability is equal to the cash premium received at the guarantees inception. For credit guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditors default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable, for each future period the credit guarantee will be outstanding. If at inception of a guarantee, we determine there is a probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value of the guarantee as described above or (b) the probable contingent loss amount. Note 2  Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Commercial Airplanes  Boeing Military Aircraft  Network  Space Systems  Global Services  Support  Total Balance at January 1, 2013 $2,125  $946  $1,513  $451  $5,035 Acquisitions     Goodwill adjustments (17 )     (17 ) Balance at December 31, 2013 $2,108  $964  $1,513  $458  $5,043 Acquisitions   Goodwill adjustments (22 ) (4 )  (26 ) Balance at December 31, 2014 $2,131  $964 $1,566 $458 $5,119 ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had indefinite-lived intangible assets with carrying amounts of $490 and $497 relating to trade names. The gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization of our acquired finite-lived intangible assets were as follows at December 31: ##TABLE_START    Gross Carrying Amount  Accumulated Amortization  Gross Carrying Amount  Accumulated Amortization Distribution rights $2,245  $550  $2,275  $483 Product know-how    Customer base    Developed technology    Other    Total $4,060  $1,681  $4,483  $1,928 ##TABLE_ENDAmortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $227 and $205 . Estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding years is as follows: ##TABLE_START      Estimated amortization expense $215  $210  $201  $190  $182 ##TABLE_ENDDuring 2014 and 2013 we acquired $87 and $144 of finite-lived intangible assets, of which $24 and $0 related to non-cash investing and financing transactions. Total acquired finite-lived intangibles of $24 and $182 remain unpaid as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 . Note 3  Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earnings per share for common shares and participating securities. The undistributed earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed earnings. Basic earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. The elements used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In millions - except per share amounts)       Years ended December 31,   Net earnings $5,446  $4,585  $3,900 Less: earnings available to participating securities   Net earnings available to common shareholders $5,440  $4,578  $3,892 Basic      Basic weighted average shares outstanding 728.9  760.8  758.0 Less: participating securities 1.3  1.9  2.3 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 727.6  758.9  755.7 Diluted      Basic weighted average shares outstanding 728.9  760.8  758.0 Dilutive potential common shares (1) 9.1  8.7  5.8 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 738.0  769.5  763.8 Less: participating securities 1.3  1.9  2.3 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 736.7  767.6  761.5 Net earnings per share:      Basic $7.47  $6.03  $5.15 Diluted 7.38  5.96  5.11 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Diluted earnings per share includes any dilutive impact of stock options, restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and performance awards. ##TABLE_END The following table includes the number of shares that may be dilutive potential common shares in the future.

The following is a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% to our effective income tax rates: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   U.S. federal statutory tax 35.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % Research and development credits (1) (2.9 )  (4.9 )  0.8 Amendments to the RE regulations (2)  (3.4 )  Tax basis adjustment (3) (3.6 )   Tax on international activities (0.2 )  (0.1 )  (1.2 ) Tax deductible dividends (0.7 )  (0.6 )  (0.7 ) State income tax provision, net of effect on U.S. federal tax 0.7  0.4  0.8 Federal audit settlements (4) (3.6 )   Other provision adjustments (1.0 )   (0.7 ) Effective income tax rate 23.7 %  26.4 %  34.0 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded tax benefits of $188 related to the reinstatement of the research tax credit for 2014. Research tax credits for the 2013 and 2012 tax years were both recorded in 2013. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  In 2013, we recorded $212 for the issuance of favorable regulations related to research and experimental (RE) expenditures. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  In the second quarter of 2014 we recorded an incremental tax benefit of $265 related to the application of a 2012 Federal Court of Claims decision which held that the tax basis in certain assets could be increased and realized upon the assets' disposition (tax basis adjustment). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  In the second quarter of 2014, tax benefits of $116 and $143 were recorded as a result of the 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 federal tax audit settlements. ##TABLE_END The research tax credit expired on December 31, 2014. If the research tax credit is not extended there would be an unfavorable impact to our 2015 effective income tax rate. Federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2011. The years 2011-2012 are currently being examined by the IRS. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2001-2014 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years. Significant components of our deferred tax (liabilities)/assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Inventory and long-term contract methods of income recognition, fixed assets and other (net of valuation allowance of $18 and $20) ($11,589 )  ($9,948 ) Pension benefits 6,145  3,099 Retiree health care benefits 2,572  2,458 Other employee benefits 1,477  1,773 Customer and commercial financing (853 )  (990 ) Net operating loss, credit and capital loss carryovers (net of valuation allowance of $63 and $105) (1)  Other net unrealized losses  Unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries (37 )  (44 ) In-process research and development related to acquisitions  Partnerships and joint ventures  (62 ) Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets (2) ($1,890 )  ($3,303 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Of the deferred tax asset for net operating loss and credit carryovers, $252 expires in years ending from December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2034 and $14 may be carried over indefinitely. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Included in the net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 are deferred tax assets in the amounts of $8,007 and $5,818 related to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. ##TABLE_END Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Deferred tax assets $14,219  $12,486 Deferred tax liabilities (16,028 )  (15,664 ) Valuation allowance (81 )  (125 ) Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets ($1,890 )  ($3,303 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have provided for U.S. deferred income taxes and foreign withholding tax in the amount of $37 on undistributed earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding tax on the remainder of undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries of approximately $800 because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that may be payable upon distribution. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position were as follows: interest of $17 and $12 and penalties of $5 and $8 . The amounts of interest benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were $17 , $4 , and $43 for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The interest benefit recorded during 2012 was primarily related to the settlement of non-US audits. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: ##TABLE_START    Unrecognized tax benefits  January 1 $1,141  $1,055  $939 Gross increases  tax positions in prior periods   Gross decreases  tax positions in prior periods (251 )  (125 )  (20 ) Gross increases  current-period tax positions   Gross decreases  current-period tax positions  (1 )  (1 ) Settlements (197 )   (1 ) Lapse of statute of limitations (1 )   Unrecognized tax benefits  December 31 $1,312  $1,141  $1,055 ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1,312 , $1,141 and $1,055 , respectively, of which $1,180 , $1,018 and $945 would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. As of December 31, 2014 , these amounts are primarily associated with U.S. federal tax issues such as the amount of research tax credits claimed, the domestic production activities deductions claimed, tax basis adjustments and U.S. taxation of foreign earnings. Also included in these amounts are accruals for domestic state tax issues such as the allocation of income among various state tax jurisdictions and the amount of state tax credits claimed. Note 5  Accounts Receivable, net Accounts receivable at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   U.S. government contracts $4,281  $3,604 Defense, Space  Security customers (1) 1,018  1,073 Commercial Airplanes customers 1,749  1,072 Reinsurance receivables  Other  Less valuation allowance (127 )  (104 ) Total $7,729  $6,546 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Excludes U.S. government contracts ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes our accounts receivable under long-term contracts that were unbillable or related to outstanding claims as of December 31 : ##TABLE_START  Unbillable  Claims     Current $2,306  $1,550  $29  $3 Expected to be collected after one year 1,408  1,020   Total $3,714  $2,570  $102  $64 ##TABLE_ENDUnder contract accounting unbillable receivables on long-term contracts arise when the sales or revenues based on performance attainment, though appropriately recognized, cannot be billed yet under terms of the contract as of the balance sheet date. Any adjustment for the credit quality of unbillable receivables, if required, would be recorded as a direct reduction of revenue. Factors considered in assessing the collectability of unbillable receivables include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. Unbillable receivables related to commercial customers expected to be collected after one year were  $172 and $179 at December 31, 2014 and 2013 . Accounts receivable related to claims are items that we believe are earned, but are subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate realization. Accounts receivable as of December 31, 2014 , includes $112 of unbillable receivables on a long-term contract with LightSquared, LP (LightSquared) related to the construction of two commercial satellites. One of the satellites has been delivered, and the other is substantially complete but remains in Boeings possession. On May 14, 2012, LightSquared filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. We believe that our rights in the second satellite and related ground-segment assets are sufficient to protect the value of our receivables in the event LightSquared fails to make payments as contractually required or rejects its contract with us. Given the uncertainties inherent in bankruptcy proceedings, it is reasonably possible that we could incur losses related to these receivables in connection with the LightSquared bankruptcy. Accounts receivable, other than those described above, expected to be collected after one year are not material. Note 6  Inventories Inventories at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Long-term contracts in progress $13,381  $12,608 Commercial aircraft programs 55,220  48,065 Commercial spare parts, used aircraft, general stock materials and other 7,421  7,793 Inventory before advances and progress billings 76,022  68,466 Less advances and progress billings (29,266 )  (25,554 ) Total $46,756  $42,912 ##TABLE_ENDLong-Term Contracts in Progress Long-term contracts in progress includes Delta launch program inventory that is being sold at cost to United Launch Alliance ( ULA ) under an inventory supply agreement that terminates on March 31, 2021. At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the inventory balance was $154 (net of advances of $322 ) and $425 (net of advances of $331 ). At December 31, 2014 , $292 of this inventory related to unsold launches. See Note 12 . Capitalized precontract costs of $1,281 and $520 at December 31, 2014 and 2013 are included in inventories. See C-17 in Note 11 . Commercial Aircraft Programs At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 787 program: $33,163 and $27,576 of work in process (including deferred production costs of $26,149 and $21,620 ), $2,257 and $2,189 of supplier advances, and $3,801 and $3,377 of unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs. At December 31, 2014 , $20,982 of 787 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and $8,968 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 747 program: $1,741 and $1,554 of deferred production costs, net of previously recorded reach-forward losses, and $476 and $563 of unamortized tooling costs. At December 31, 2014 , $1,047 of 747 deferred production and unamortized tooling costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and $1,170 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. Commercial aircraft programs inventory included amounts credited in cash or other consideration (early issue sales consideration) to airline customers totaling $3,341 and $3,465 at December 31, 2014 and 2013 . Note 7  Customer Financing Customer financing primarily relates to the Boeing Capital (BCC) segment and consisted of the following at December 31: ##TABLE_START   Financing receivables:    Investment in sales-type/finance leases $1,535  $1,699 Notes  Total financing receivables 1,905  2,286 Operating lease equipment, at cost, less accumulated depreciation of $571 and $564 1,677  1,734 Gross customer financing 3,582  4,020 Less allowance for losses on receivables (21 )  (49 ) Total $3,561  $3,971 ##TABLE_ENDThe components of investment in sales-type/finance leases at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Minimum lease payments receivable $1,475  $1,731 Estimated residual value of leased assets  Unearned income (461 )  (575 ) Total $1,535  $1,699 ##TABLE_ENDOperating lease equipment primarily includes large commercial jet aircraft and regional jet aircraft. At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , operating lease equipment included $48 and $83 of BCC equipment available for sale or re-lease. At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had firm lease commitments for $0 and $57 of this equipment. Financing receivable balances evaluated for impairment at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Individually evaluated for impairment $86  $95 Collectively evaluated for impairment 1,819  2,191 Total financing receivables $1,905  $2,286 ##TABLE_ENDWe determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms. At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we individually evaluated for impairment customer financing receivables of $86 and $95 and determined that none of these were impaired. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had no material receivables that were greater than 30 days past due and we had no impaired customer financing receivables during 2014. Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Income is recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , interest income recognized on such receivables was $30 and $6 , and the average recorded investment in impaired financing receivables was $376 and $466 . The change in the allowance for losses on financing receivables for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 , consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    Beginning balance - January 1 ($49 )  ($60 )  ($70 ) Customer financing valuation benefit   Ending balance - December 31 ($21 )  ($49 )  ($60 ) Collectively evaluated for impairment ($21 )  ($49 )  ($60 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customer financing receivables are customer credit ratings, default rates and collateral values. We assign internal credit ratings for all customers and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers. Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies. Our financing receivable balances at December 31 by internal credit rating category are shown below: ##TABLE_START Rating categories  BBB $1,055  $1,091 BB  B  CCC  Other  Total carrying value of financing receivables $1,905  $2,286 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2014 , our allowance related to receivables with ratings of B and BBB. We applied default rates that averaged 16% and 2% to the exposure associated with those receivables. Customer Financing Exposure Customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance and overall market conditions and may be subject to reduced valuation with market decline. Declines in collateral values are also a significant driver of our allowance for losses. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have experienced greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft. Our customer financing portfolio is primarily collateralized by out-of-production 717, 757 and MD-80 aircraft. The majority of customer financing carrying values are concentrated in the following aircraft models at December 31: ##TABLE_START   717 Aircraft ($421 and $444 accounted for as operating leases) $1,562  $1,674 747 Aircraft ($601 and $183 accounted for as operating leases)  757 Aircraft ($349 and $402 accounted for as operating leases)  MD-80 Aircraft (Accounted for as sales-type finance leases)  767 Aircraft ($47 and $60 accounted for as operating leases)  737 Aircraft ($127 and $138 accounted for as operating leases)  MD-11 Aircraft (Accounted for as operating leases)  787 Aircraft (Accounted for as operating leases)  ##TABLE_ENDCharges related to customer financing asset impairment for the years ended December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Boeing Capital $139  $67  $73 Other Boeing   (15 ) Total $184  $81  $58 ##TABLE_ENDScheduled receipts on customer financing are as follows: ##TABLE_START Year      Beyond 2019 Principal payments on notes receivable $55  $41  $42  $120  $69  $43 Sales-type/finance lease payments receivable      Operating lease equipment payments receivable      ##TABLE_ENDNote 8  Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Land $560  $562 Buildings and land improvements 11,767  11,068 Machinery and equipment 12,867  12,376 Construction in progress 1,502  1,288 Gross property, plant and equipment 26,696  25,294 Less accumulated depreciation (15,689 )  (15,070 ) Total $11,007  $10,224 ##TABLE_ENDDepreciation expense was $1,414 , $1,338 and $1,248 for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Interest capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 totaled $102 , $87 and $74 , respectively. Rental expense for leased properties was $277 , $287 and $276 , for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. At December 31, 2014 , minimum rental payments under capital leases aggregated $158 . Minimum rental payments under operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more aggregated $1,486 , net of sublease payments of $17 at December 31, 2014 . Payments due under operating and capital leases net of sublease amounts and non-cancellable future rentals during the next five years are as follows: ##TABLE_START      Minimum operating lease payments, net of sublease amounts $221  $203  $175  $146  $123 Minimum capital lease payments, net of sublease amounts     ##TABLE_ENDAccounts payable related to purchases of property, plant and equipment were $299 and $213 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 .

The $356 includes $147 related to a payment made by us under a bank guarantee on behalf of Sea Launch and $209 related to loans (partner loans) we made to Sea Launch. The net amounts owed to Boeing by each of the partners are as follows: S.P. Koroley Rocket and Space Corporation Energia of Russia  $223 , PO Yuzhnoye Mashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukraine  $89 and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine  $44 . Although each partner is contractually obligated to reimburse us for its share of the bank guarantee, the Russian and Ukrainian partners have raised defenses to enforcement and contested our claims. On October 19, 2009, we filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launch partners of the  $147 bank guarantee payment. On October 7, 2010, the arbitrator ruled that the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter but did not resolve the merits of our claim. We filed a notice appealing the arbitrators ruling on January 11, 2011. On April 11, 2014, the appellate court entered a ruling that the decision of the arbitrator is not appealable. On May 9, 2014, we filed a brief with the Supreme Court of Sweden appealing the appellate court's April 11, 2014 ruling. On February 1, 2013, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launch partners of the $147 bank guarantee payment and the $209 partner loan obligations. A trial in the United States District Court for the Central District of California is scheduled to commence July 14, 2015. We believe the partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and remedies. In the event we are unable to secure reimbursement of $147 related to our payment under the bank guarantee and $209 related to partner loans made to Sea Launch, we could incur additional charges. Our current assessment as to the collectability of these receivables takes into account the current economic conditions in Russia and Ukraine, although we will continue to monitor the situation. Note 11  Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Accrued compensation and employee benefit costs $5,868  $6,158 Environmental  Product warranties 1,504  1,570 Forward loss recognition  Dividends payable  Other 4,319  4,852 Total $13,343  $14,131 ##TABLE_ENDEnvironmental The following table summarizes environmental remediation activity during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 . ##TABLE_START   Beginning balance  January 1 $649  $710 Reductions for payments made (89 )  (120 ) Changes in estimates  Ending balance  December 31 $601  $649 ##TABLE_ENDThe liabilities recorded represent our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred to remediate sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios that includes the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. There are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by $874 and $928 . Product Warranties The following table summarizes product warranty activity recorded during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 . ##TABLE_START   Beginning balance  January 1 $1,570  $1,572 Additions for current year deliveries  Reductions for payments made (432 )  (419 ) Changes in estimates (200 )  (178 ) Ending balance - December 31 $1,504  $1,570 ##TABLE_ENDCommercial Aircraft Commitments In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and airline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer. Trade-in commitment agreements at December 31, 2014 have expiration dates from 2015 through 2026 . At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , total contractual trade-in commitments were $2,392 and $1,605 . As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we estimated that it was probable we would be obligated to perform on certain of these commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling $446 and $325 and the fair value of the related trade-in aircraft was $446 and $325 . Financing Commitments Financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, totaled $16,723 and $17,987 as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 . The estimated earliest potential funding dates for these commitments as of December 31, 2014 are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Total $2,552 3,710 3,497 2,305 1,738 Thereafter 2,921  $16,723 ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2014 all of these financing commitments related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. We have concluded that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralization and interest rates, under which funding would be provided. Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $3,985 and $4,376 as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 . Commitments to ULA We and Lockheed Martin Corporation have each committed to provide ULA with up to $527 of additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. See Note 6 . C-17 In September 2013, we decided to end production of C-17 aircraft in late 2015. In April 2014, we announced that we anticipate ending production approximately three months earlier based on our decision to produce three fewer aircraft in 2015 than previously planned. As a result, during the first quarter of 2014, BDS recorded $48 to write off inventory and accrue termination liabilities to suppliers. At December 31, 2014, our backlog included international orders for three C-17 aircraft that are scheduled for delivery in 2015 and we have active sales campaigns for the remaining seven unsold aircraft. We are currently incurring costs and have made commitments to suppliers related to these aircraft. We believe it is probable that we will recover costs related to the unsold aircraft from international customer orders. Should orders for the seven unsold aircraft not materialize or should we decide to discontinue production of unsold aircraft, we could incur further charges to write-down inventory and/or record termination liabilities. At December 31, 2014 , we had approximately $1,091 of capitalized precontract costs and $385 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers associated with unsold aircraft. F/A-18 At December 31, 2014 , our backlog included 68 F/A-18 aircraft under contract with the U.S. Navy. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 , funds 15 additional F/A-18 aircraft. The orders in backlog, combined with anticipated orders for the 15 aircraft currently funded, would complete production in 2017. The Presidents Fiscal Year 2016 budget request submitted in February 2015 did not include funding for additional F/A-18 aircraft. We are continuing to work with our U.S. customer as well as international customers to secure additional orders. Should additional orders not materialize, it is reasonably possible that we will decide in the next twelve months to end production of the F/A-18 at a future date. We are still evaluating the full financial impact of a potential production shutdown, including any recovery that may be available from the U.S. government. Company Owned Life Insurance McDonnell Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life insurance policies with a cash surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the cash surrender value was $466 and $451 and the total loans were $439 and $425 . As we have the right to offset the loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 . United States Government Defense Environment Overview U.S. government appropriation levels remain subject to significant uncertainty. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act (The Act) established limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending by approximately $490 billion between the 2012 and 2021 U.S. government fiscal years. The Act also provided that the defense budget would face sequestration cuts of up to an additional $500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded. While the impact of sequestration cuts was reduced with respect to FY2014 and FY2015 following the enactment of The Bipartisan Budget Act in December 2013, significant uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending. It is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels for FY2016 and beyond will continue to be subject to significant pressure, including risk of future sequestration cuts. Significant uncertainty also continues with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) and other government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorization and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. In addition to the risks described above, if Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner, a government shutdown could result which could have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts or sequestration impacts. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. DoD or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders. KC-46A Tanker and BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work. BDS fixed-price contracts with significant development work include Airborne Early Warning and Control, Commercial Crew, India P-8I, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker and commercial and military satellites. The operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost and revenue estimates could result in lower margins or material charges for reach-forward losses. For example, during the second quarter of 2014, higher estimated costs to complete the KC-46A Tanker contract for the U.S. Air Force resulted in a reach-forward loss of $425 of which the Commercial Airplanes segment recorded $238 and the BMA segment recorded $187 . Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts Our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve for amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide refunds to the U.S. government. Russia/Ukraine We continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. A number of our commercial customers also have operations in Russia and Ukraine. To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to production or deliveries. Should suppliers or customers experience disruption, our production and/or deliveries could be materially impacted. 747 and 787 Commercial Airplane Programs The development and initial production of new commercial airplanes and new commercial airplane derivatives, which include the 747 and 787, entail significant commitments to customers and suppliers as well as substantial investments in working capital, infrastructure and research and development. The 747 and 787 programs had gross margins that were breakeven or near breakeven during 2014 . Lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft have resulted in ongoing pricing pressures and fewer 747 orders than anticipated. We continue to have a number of unsold 747 production positions. If market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, the program could face a reach-forward loss that may be material. The combination of production challenges, change incorporation, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts has created significant pressure on 787 program profitability. If risks related to this program, including risks associated with planned production rate increases or introducing and manufacturing the 787-10 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions, as well as a reach-forward loss that may be material. Note 12  Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees. The following table provides quantitative data regarding our third party guarantees. The maximum potential payments represent a worst-case scenario, and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset our payments under guarantees. The carrying amount of liabilities represents the amount included in Accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_START  Maximum Potential Payments  Estimated Proceeds from Collateral/ Recourse  Carrying Amount of Liabilities December 31, 2013  2013  2013 Contingent repurchase commitments $1,375 $1,872  $1,364 $1,871  $5 $5 Indemnifications to ULA:         Contributed Delta program launch inventory 127       Contract pricing 261     7 Other Delta contracts 227     Other indemnifications 106     28 Credit guarantees 35  27  2 ##TABLE_ENDContingent Repurchase Commitments The repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase commitments is generally lower than the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date. Indemnifications to ULA In 2006, we agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 of Boeing Delta launch program inventory included in contributed assets plus $1,860 of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021 . Since inception, ULA has consumed $1,246 of the $1,360 of inventory that was contributed by us and has yet to consume $114 . ULA has made advance payments of $1,609 to us and we have recorded revenues and cost of sales of $1,287 under the inventory supply agreement through December 31, 2014 . We agreed to indemnify ULA against potential losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) for four satellite missions. We believe ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing. In December 2008, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value for two satellite missions. In March 2009, the USAF issued a denial of that claim. In June 2009, ULA filed a notice of appeal, and in October 2009, ULA filed a complaint before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) for a contract adjustment for the price of the two satellite missions. In September 2009, the USAF exercised its option for a third satellite mission. During the third quarter of 2010, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value of the third mission. The USAF did not exercise an option for a fourth mission prior to the expiration of the contract. In March 2011, ULA filed a notice of appeal before the ASBCA, seeking to re-price the third mission. On November 20, 2013, the ASBCA denied USAF motions for summary judgment against ULA in large part, leaving ULA s claims against the USAF substantially intact. The hearing before the ASBCA concluded on December 20, 2013. The parties filed their final post-hearing briefs in May 2014. The ASBCA may now issue a decision at any time. If ULA is ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining additional pricing, we may be responsible for an indemnification payment up to $261 and may record up to $278 in pre-tax losses associated with the three missions. Potential payments for Other Delta contracts include $85 related to deferred support costs. In June 2011, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) notified ULA that it had determined that $271 of deferred support costs are not recoverable under government contracts. In December 2011, the DCMA notified ULA of the potential non-recoverability of an additional $114 of deferred production costs. ULA and Boeing believe that all costs are recoverable and in November 2011, ULA filed a certified claim with the USAF for collection of deferred support and production costs. The USAF issued a final decision denying ULAs certified claim in May 2012. On June 14, 2012, Boeing and ULA filed a suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking recovery of the deferred support and production costs from the U.S. government. On November 9, 2012, the U.S. government filed an answer to our claim and asserted a counterclaim for credits that it alleges were offset by deferred support cost invoices. We believe that the U.S. governments counterclaim is without merit, and have filed an answer challenging it on multiple grounds. The litigation is in the discovery phase and the Court has not yet set a trial date. If, contrary to our belief, it is determined that some or all of the deferred support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record pre-tax losses and make indemnification payments to ULA for up to $317 of the costs questioned by the DCMA. Other Indemnifications As part of the 2004 sale agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation related to the sale of BCCs Commercial Financial Services business, BCC is involved in a loss sharing arrangement for losses on transferred portfolio assets, such as asset sales, provisions for loss or asset impairment charges offset by gains from asset sales. At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , our maximum future cash exposure to losses associated with the loss sharing arrangement was $63 and $106 and our accrued liability under the loss sharing arrangement was $20 and $28 . In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and our Commercial Airplanes facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. It is impossible to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 11 . Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees, principally to facilitate the sale and/or financing of commercial aircraft. Under these arrangements, we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that lease or loan payments are not made by the original lessee or debtor or certain specified services are not performed. A substantial portion of these guarantees has been extended on behalf of original lessees or debtors with less than investment-grade credit. Our commercial aircraft credit guarantees are collateralized by the underlying commercial aircraft and certain other assets. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire within the next six years. Industrial Revenue Bonds Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by the City of Wichita were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property at our Wichita site. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a ten-year property tax abatement and a sales tax exemption from the Kansas Department of Revenue. We record the property on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, along with a capital lease obligation to repay the proceeds of the IRB. We have also purchased the IRBs and therefore are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the property purchased with the IRB proceeds. The capital lease obligation and IRB asset are recorded net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the assets and liabilities associated with the City of Wichita IRBs were $638 and $690 . Note 13  Debt On October 31, 2014 , we issued $300 of fixed rate senior notes due October 30, 2021 with an annual interest rate of 2.35% , $300 of fixed rate senior notes due October 30, 2024 with an annual interest rate of 2.85% , and $250 of floating rate senior notes due October 30, 2017 . Each series of fixed rate senior notes may be redeemed at our option at any time for a redemption price equal to the full principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole premium. The floating rate senior notes bear interest at an annual rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 12.5 basis points , and are not redeemable prior to maturity. The notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds of the issuance, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, totaled $838 , of which $544 were used to fund BCC. Interest incurred, including amounts capitalized, was $504 , $548 and $625 for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Interest expense recorded by BCC is reflected as Boeing Capital interest expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Total Company interest payments were $511 , $551 and $614 for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. We have $5,005 currently available under credit line agreements, of which $2,473 is a 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in November 2015 and $2,472 expires in November 2019 and $60 in November 2017 . The 364-day credit facility has a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration date. We continue to be in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt or credit facility agreements. Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Unsecured debt securities $755  $1,370 Non-recourse debt and notes  Capital lease obligations  Other notes  Total $929  $1,563 ##TABLE_ENDDebt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Unsecured debt securities    Variable rate: 3-month USD LIBOR plus 1 basis point due 2014  $150 Variable rate: 3-month USD LIBOR plus 12.5 basis points due 2017 $250   0.95% - 5.00% due through 2024 4,223  4,832 5.88% - 6.88% due through 2043 2,394  2,392 7.25% - 8.75% due through 2043 1,657  1,672 Non-recourse debt and notes    6.98% - 7.38% notes due through 2021  Capital lease obligations due through 2024  Other notes  Total debt $9,070  $9,635 ##TABLE_ENDTotal debt is attributable to: ##TABLE_START   BCC $2,412  $2,577 Other Boeing 6,658  7,058 Total debt $9,070  $9,635 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2014 , $213 of debt (non-recourse debt, notes and capital lease obligations) was collateralized by customer financing assets totaling $362 .

In 2014, we announced changes to our retirement plans whereby nonunion and the majority of union employees currently participating in defined benefit pension plans will transition in 2016 to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan. We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans participants, and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for future benefit payments. We also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for approximately half those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered by most United Auto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage. The funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). We have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Other assets, and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in Accrued liabilities. The components of net periodic benefit cost were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits Years ended December 31,      Service cost $1,661  $1,886  $1,649  $129  $148  $146 Interest cost 3,058  2,906  3,005    Expected return on plan assets (4,169 )  (3,874 )  (3,831 )  (8 )  (6 )  (7 ) Amortization of prior service costs    (144 )  (180 )  (197 ) Recognized net actuarial loss 1,020  2,231  1,937    Settlement/curtailment/other losses      (1 ) Net periodic benefit cost $2,208  $3,449  $3,010  $275  $320  $373             Net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations $3,215  $3,036  $2,407  $287  $353  $543 ##TABLE_ENDThe following tables show changes in the benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status of both pensions and OPB for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 . Benefit obligation balances presented below reflect the PBO for our pension plans, and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations (APBO) for our OPB plans. ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits     Change in benefit obligation        Beginning balance $68,625  $75,895  $7,008  $7,981 Service cost 1,661  1,886   Interest cost 3,058  2,906   Plan participants contributions    Amendments   (43 )  Actuarial (gain)/loss 10,655  (9,205 )   (905 ) Settlement/curtailment/other (2,518 )  (81 )   (57 ) Gross benefits paid (3,126 )  (2,874 )  (449 )  (451 ) Subsidies      Exchange rate adjustment (21 )  (21 )  (8 )  (7 ) Ending balance $78,391  $68,625  $7,306  $7,008 Change in plan assets        Beginning balance at fair value $58,131  $56,178  $140  $110 Actual return on plan assets 5,893  3,316   Company contribution  1,542   Plan participants contributions    Settlement/curtailment/other (640 )  (103 )   Benefits paid (3,039 )  (2,792 )  (19 )  (21 ) Exchange rate adjustment (16 )  (18 )   Ending balance at fair value $61,119  $58,131  $141  $140 Amounts recognized in statement of financial position at December 31 consist of:        Other assets $3  $60     Other accrued liabilities (93 )  (80 )  ($363 )  ($340 ) Accrued retiree health care   (6,802 )  (6,528 ) Accrued pension plan liability, net (17,182 )  (10,474 )     Net amount recognized ($17,272 )  ($10,494 )  ($7,165 )  ($6,868 ) ##TABLE_ENDAmounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits     Net actuarial loss $21,321  $15,460  $877  $561 Prior service costs/(credits)   (512 )  (614 ) Total recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss $21,706  $16,248  $365  ($53 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe estimated amount that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits Recognized net actuarial loss $1,581  $27 Amortization of prior service costs/(credits)  (134 ) Total $1,774  ($107 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe ABO for all pension plans was $75,655 and $63,491 at December 31, 2014 and 2013 . Key information for our plans with ABO in excess of plan assets as of December 31 was as follows: ##TABLE_START   Projected benefit obligation $78,358  $63,445 Accumulated benefit obligation 75,622  58,334 Fair value of plan assets 61,082  52,905 ##TABLE_ENDAssumptions The following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31 of each year and the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year. ##TABLE_START December 31,   Discount rate:      Pension 3.90 %  4.80 %  3.80 % Other postretirement benefits 3.50 %  4.20 %  3.30 % Expected return on plan assets 7.00 %  7.50 %  7.50 % Rate of compensation increase 3.80 %  4.00 %  4.00 % ##TABLE_ENDThe discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high quality bonds that are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yields developed from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. A portfolio of about 400 bonds is used to construct the yield curve. Since corporate bond yields are generally not available at maturities beyond 30 years, it is assumed that spot rates will remain level beyond that 30-year point. The present value of each plans benefits is calculated by applying the spot/discount rates to projected benefit cash flows. All bonds are U.S. issues, with a minimum outstanding of $50. The pension funds expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the upcoming plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five -year moving average of plan assets. As of December 31, 2014 , the MRVA was approximately $1,813 less than the fair market value of assets. Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows: ##TABLE_START December 31,   Health care cost trend rate assumed next year 7.00 %  7.00 %  7.50 % Ultimate trend rate 5.00 %  5.00 %  5.00 % Year that trend reached ultimate rate   ##TABLE_ENDAssumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. To determine the health care cost trend rates we look at a combination of information including ongoing claims cost monitoring, annual statistical analyses of claims data, reconciliation of forecast claims against actual claims, review of trend assumptions of other plan sponsors and national health trends, and adjustments for plan design changes, workforce changes, and changes in plan participant behavior. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect: ##TABLE_START  Increase  Decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost $54  ($45 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation  (613 ) ##TABLE_ENDDuring 2014 the Company conducted a mortality experience study and adopted new company specific tables for purposes of determining the Companys mortality assumption used in the defined benefit plan liability calculation. The new tables resulted in an increase of $2,500 and $200 to the projected benefit obligation for pension and other postretirement benefits, respectively as of December 31, 2014. Plan Assets Investment Strategy The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive, total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified. We periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investment benchmarks for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions (such as private equity and real estate), and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced on a monthly basis. The actual and target allocations by asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Actual Allocations  Target Allocations Asset Class    Fixed income %  %  %  % Global equity    Private equity    Real estate and real assets    Global strategies    Hedge funds    Total %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDFixed income securities are invested broadly and primarily in long duration instruments. Global equity securities are invested broadly in U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various industries and market capitalizations. Real estate and real assets include global private investments that may be held through an investment in a limited partnership (LP) or other fund structures and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) in the case of real estate). Real estate includes, but is not limited to, investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include, but are not limited to, investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber), commodities and infrastructure. Private equity investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) and fund-of-funds that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies. Global strategies investments seek to capitalize on inefficiencies identified across different asset classes or markets, primarily using long-short positions in derivatives and physical securities. Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to, event driven, relative value, long-short and multi-strategy. Investment managers are retained for explicit investment roles specified by contractual investment guidelines. Certain investment managers are authorized to invest in derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve the desired market exposure of a security or an index, transfer value-added performance between asset classes, achieve the desired currency exposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation. As a percentage of total pension plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were 3.5% and 18.3% for fixed income, including to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and 2.0% and (2.2)% for global equity and commodities at December 31, 2014 and 2013 . Risk Management In managing the plan assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach and are integral to the overall investment strategy. Further, asset classes are constructed to achieve diversification by investment strategy, by investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored regularly through the custodian. Credit parameters for counterparties have been established for managers permitted to trade over-the-counter derivatives. Valuation is governed through several types of procedures, including reviews of manager valuation policies, custodian valuation processes, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconciliation, and periodic, security-specific valuation testing . Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 . The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013  Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fixed income securities:         Corporate $17,488 $17,486 $2 $15,262 $15,238 $24 U.S. government and agencies 5,224 5,224 4,537 4,537 Mortgage backed and asset backed 1,207 611 1,040 549 Municipal 1,636 1,636 1,722  1,722 Sovereign 1,073 1,073 1,018  1,018  Common/collective/pooled funds 2,127 $18 2,109 2,538 $16 2,522  Other 9 252 229 Derivatives:         Assets 49 55 Liabilities (66 ) (66 ) (10 ) (10 ) Cash equivalents and other short-term investments 792 801 Currency overlay derivatives:         Assets 2 Liabilities (3 ) (3 ) Equity securities:         U.S. common and preferred stock 7,577 7,577 6,919 6,919 Non-U.S. common and preferred stock 7,151 7,139 1 7,722 7,721 Common/collective/pooled funds 2,658 2,443 3,239 2,675 Derivatives:         Assets 9 4 Liabilities (5 ) (5 ) (6 ) (6 ) Private equity  2,955 2,927 2,968 2,958 Real estate and real assets:         Real estate 3,199 41 2,653 2,865 16 2,424 Real assets 1,567 433 1,506 464 Derivatives:         Assets 2 1 Liabilities (11 ) (11 ) (1 ) (1 ) Global strategies 2,248 2,248 2,355 2,355 Hedge funds 3,372 2,411 2,776 1,667 1,109 Total $60,750 $15,692 $36,718 $8,340 $57,794 $15,991 $33,777 $8,026          Cash $115    $87    Receivables       Payables (193 )    (208 )    Total $61,119    $58,131    ##TABLE_ENDFixed income securities are primarily valued upon a market approach, using matrix pricing and considering a securitys relationship to other securities for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or an income approach, converting future cash flows to a single present value amount. Inputs used in developing fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads. Common/collective/pooled funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their net asset values (NAVs) that are calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives included in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued using an income approach with inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates. Exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Cash equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingled fund (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued daily using a market approach with inputs that include quoted market prices for similar instruments. In the event a market price is not available for instruments with an original maturity of one year or less, amortized cost is used as a proxy for fair value. Common and preferred stock equity securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Private equity and private debt NAV valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) we use NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Real estate and real asset NAV valuations are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) NAVs are adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Publicly traded REITs and infrastructure stocks are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Global strategies investments are primarily limited liability company (LLC) or mutual fund structures. The NAVs are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which are primarily valued using a market approach. The funds generally have monthly liquidity. Hedge funds consist of fund-of-fund LLC structures and direct hedge funds. The NAVs of the fund-of-funds are based on the NAVs of the underlying hedge funds as well as any cash and accruals held at the fund-of-fund level. For direct hedge funds the NAVs are primarily based on valuation of the underlying investments. This is primarily done by applying a market or income valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument held. Redemptions in hedge funds are based on specific terms and conditions of the individual funds. Investments in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, global strategies, and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the General Partner (GP), fund manager or third party administrator. Pension assets invested in these structures rely on the NAV of these investments as the practical expedient for the valuations. The following tables present a reconciliation of Level 3 assets held during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 . Transfers into and out of Level 3 are reported at the beginning-of-year values. ##TABLE_START  January 1 2014 Balance  Net Realized and Unrealized Gains/(Losses)  Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements  Net Transfers Into/(Out of) Level 3  December 31 2014 Balance Fixed income securities:          Corporate (1) $19    ($7 )  ($10 )  $2 Mortgage backed and asset backed (1)     Other   (27 )    Equity securities:         Non-U.S. common and preferred stock   (1 )   Common/collective/ pooled funds   (24 )  Private equity 2,958   (446 )   2,927 Real estate and real assets:          Real estate 2,424   (107 )   2,653 Real assets     Hedge funds 1,109  (36 )   (173 )  Total $8,026  $761  ($298 )  ($149 )  $8,340 ##TABLE_END(1) Certain fixed income securities were reclassified from corporate to mortgage backed and asset backed on January 1, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014 , the change in unrealized gain for Level 3 assets still held at December 31, 2014 were $8 for mortgage and asset backed fixed income, $7 for other fixed income, ($24) for common/collective/pooled funds, ($3) for private equity, $198 for real estate, ($38) for real assets and ($48) for hedge funds. ##TABLE_START  January 1 2013 Balance  Net Realized and Unrealized Gains  Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements  Net Transfers Into/(Out of) Level 3  December 31 2013 Balance Fixed income securities:          Corporate $3   $16  $5  $24 Mortgage backed and asset backed   (11 )  (1 )  Other (2)   (27 )   Equity securities:          Non-U.S. common and preferred stock        Private equity (2) 2,671   (249 )    2,958 Real estate and real assets:          Real estate 2,128      2,424 Real assets   (36 )    Hedge funds 1,473   (627 )   1,109 Total $7,745  $1,066  ($870 )  $85  $8,026 ##TABLE_END(2) Certain private funds with a fixed income strategy were reclassified from private equity to other fixed income on January 1, 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2013 , the change in unrealized gain for Level 3 assets still held at December 31, 2013 were $21 for other fixed income, $422 for private equity, $243 for real estate, $71 for real assets and $283 for hedge funds. OPB Plan Assets The majority of OPB plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised of approximately 60% equities and 40% debt securities. The index fund is valued using a market approach based on the quoted market price of an identical instrument (Level 1). The expected rate of return on these assets does not have a material effect on the net periodic benefit cost. Cash Flows Contributions Required pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ), as well as rules governing funding of our non-U.S. pension plans, are expected to be minimal in 2015 . We do not expect contributions to our pension and OPB plans to be significant in 2015 . Estimated Future Benefit Payments The table below reflects the total pension benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants share of the cost, which is funded by participant contributions. OPB payments reflect our portion only. ##TABLE_START Year(s)      2020-2024 Pensions $3,448  $3,657  $3,828  $3,960  $3,977  $21,515 Other postretirement benefits:            Gross benefits paid      2,974 Subsidies (38 )  (38 )  (40 )  (41 )  (42 )  (211 ) Net other postretirement benefits $427  $457  $478  $517  $536  $2,763 ##TABLE_ENDTermination Provisions Certain of the pension plans provide that, in the event there is a change in control of the Company which is not approved by the Board of Directors and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required by ERISA , and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits in our group insurance benefit programs. We have an agreement with the U.S. government with respect to certain pension plans. Under the agreement, should we terminate any of the plans under conditions in which the plans assets exceed that plans obligations, the U.S. government will be entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plans assets based on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts. Defined Contribution Plans We provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expense for these defined contribution plans was $764 , $742 and $708 in 2014, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Note 15  Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements Share-Based Compensation Our 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated, permits awards of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or units, performance shares, performance restricted stock or units, performance units and other stock and cash-based awards to our employees, officers, directors, consultants, and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock authorized for issuance under the plan is 87,000,000 . Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfy these issuances during 2015 . Share-based plans expense is primarily included in General and administrative expense since it is incentive compensation issued primarily to our executives. The share-based plans expense and related income tax benefit were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Stock options $62  $93  $85 Restricted stock units and other awards   Share-based plans expense $195  $206  $193 Income tax benefit $70  $76  $75 ##TABLE_ENDStock Options In February 2013 and 2012, we granted to our executives 6,591,968 and 6,114,922 options, respectively. The options have been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. The stock options vest over a period of three years, with 34% vesting after the first year, 33% vesting after the second year and the remaining 33% vesting after the third year. If an executive terminates employment for any reason, the non-vested portion of the stock option will not vest and all rights to the non-vested portion will terminate. We discontinued granting options in 2014, replacing them with performance-based restricted stock units. Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Shares  Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share  Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years)  Aggregate Intrinsic Value Number of shares under option:        Outstanding at beginning of year 23,767,743  $73.97     Granted 20,008  124.98     Exercised (4,584,615)  74.82     Forfeited (697,891)  75.70     Expired (600)  50.57     Outstanding at end of year 18,504,645  $73.75  5.93  $1,041 Exercisable at end of year 13,215,966  $72.74  5.10  $757 ##TABLE_ENDThe total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $250 , $546 and $89 , respectively. Cash received from options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $343 , $1,097 and $120 with a related tax benefit of $87 , $190 and $29 , respectively, derived from the compensation deductions resulting from these option exercises. At December 31, 2014 , there was $34 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to our stock option plan which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of one year. The grant date fair value of stock options vested during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $87 , $89 and $83 , respectively. The fair values of options were estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: ##TABLE_START Grant Year Grant Date  Expected Life  Expected Volatility  Expected Dividend Yield  Risk Free Interest Rate  Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share 2/25/2013  6 years  29.0 %  2.6 %  1.0 %  $15.85 2/27/2012  6 years  29.9 %  2.4 %  1.1 %  $16.89 ##TABLE_ENDThe expected volatility of the stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock volatility and the volatility levels implied on the grant date by actively traded option contracts on our common stock. We determined the expected term of the stock option grants to be six years, calculated using the simplified method in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 110. We use the simplified method since we changed the vesting terms, tax treatment and the recipients of our stock options beginning in 2006 such that we believe our historical data prior to 2006 does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term and we do not have enough option exercise data from our grants issued subsequent to 2006 to support our own estimate as a result of vesting terms and changes in the stock price. Restricted Stock Units In February 2014, 2013 and 2012 , we granted to our executives 695,651 , 1,375,414 and 1,369,810  restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of $129.58 , $75.97 and $75.40 per unit, respectively. The RSUs granted under this program will vest and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. In addition to RSUs awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant RSUs to certain executives and employees to encourage retention or to reward various achievements. These RSUs are labeled other RSUs in the table below. The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average of the high and low stock prices on the date of grant. RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 was as follows: ##TABLE_START  Long-Term Incentive Program  Other Number of units:    Outstanding at beginning of year 3,722,317  1,132,930 Granted 729,603  288,600 Dividends 72,387  25,833 Forfeited (177,986 )  (13,962 ) Distributed (1,313,782 )  (286,303 ) Outstanding at end of year 3,032,539  1,147,098 Unrecognized compensation cost $94  $41 Weighted average remaining contractual life (years) 1.7  2.3 ##TABLE_ENDThe number of vested but undistributed RSUs at December 31, 2014 was not significant. Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PBRSUs) are stock units that pay out based on the Companys total shareholder return as compared to a group of peer companies over a three-year period. The award payout can range from 0% to 200% of the initial PBRSU grant, but will not exceed 400% of the initial value (excluding dividend equivalent credits). The PBRSUs granted under this program will vest at the payout amount and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) remains eligible under the award and, if the award is earned, will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the PBRSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. In February 2014, we granted to our executives 662,215 initial PBRSUs as part of our long-term incentive program with a grant date fair value of $136.12 per unit. Compensation expense for the award is recognized over the three-year performance period based upon the grant date fair value estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The model used the following assumptions: expected volatility of 24.2% based upon our historical stock volatility, a risk-free interest rate of 0.72% , and no expected dividend yield because the units earn dividend equivalents. PBRSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 was as follows: ##TABLE_START   Long-Term Incentive Program Number of units:   Outstanding at beginning of year  Granted  662,215 Dividends  10,497 Forfeited  (49,610 ) Distributed  Outstanding at end of year  623,102 Unrecognized compensation cost  $53 Weighted average remaining contractual life (years)  2.1 ##TABLE_ENDOther Compensation Arrangements Performance Awards Performance Awards are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a three-year period. Each unit has an initial value of $100 dollars. The amount payable at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars per unit, depending on the Companys performance against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to pay these awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on the estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period. During 2014, 2013 and 2012 , we granted Performance Awards to our executives with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals for each three -year period following the grant date. The minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out for the 2014, 2013 and 2012 Performance Awards is $343 , $261 and $251 , respectively. The 2012 grant is expected to be paid out in cash in March 2015 . Deferred Compensation The Company has a deferred compensation plan which permits executives to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus, and certain other incentive awards. Participants can diversify deferred compensation among 23 investment funds including a Boeing stock unit account. Total expense related to deferred compensation was $44 , $238 and $75 in 2014, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the deferred compensation liability which is being marked to market was $1,234 and $1,258 . Note 16  Shareholders Equity On December 15, 2014, the Board approved a new repurchase plan for up to $ 12,000 of common stock, replacing the previously authorized program. The program will expire when we have used all authorized funds or is otherwise terminated. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , there were 1,200,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. No preferred stock has been issued. Changes in Share Balances The following table shows changes in each class of shares: ##TABLE_START  Common Stock  Treasury Stock Balance at January 1, 2012 1,012,261,159  267,556,388 Issued   (11,935,423 ) Acquired   1,009,663 Balance at December 31, 2012 1,012,261,159  256,630,628 Issued   (17,903,704 ) Acquired   26,155,537 Balance at December 31, 2013 1,012,261,159  264,882,461 Issued   (6,719,270 ) Acquired   47,370,415 Balance at December 31, 2014 1,012,261,159  305,533,606 ##TABLE_ENDAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI) by component for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Currency Translation Adjustments  Unrealized Gains and Losses on Certain Investments  Unrealized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments  Defined Benefit Pension Plans  Other Postretirement Benefits  Total (1) Balance at January 1, 2012 $197  ($8 )  $66  ($16,755 )  ($16,500 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications    (2,290 )  (2,248 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI   (5 )  1,337 (2)  1,332 Net current period Other comprehensive loss    (953 )  (916 ) Balance at December 31, 2012 $214  ($8 )  $86  ($17,708 )  ($17,416 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications (64 )   (75 )  6,093  5,954 Amounts reclassified from AOCI   (17 )  1,585 (2)  1,568 Net current period Other comprehensive income/(loss) (64 )   (92 )  7,678  7,522 Balance at December 31, 2013 $150  ($8 )  ($6 )  ($10,030 )  ($9,894 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications (97 )   (137 )  (4,644 )  (4,878 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI    (2)  Net current period Other comprehensive income/(loss) (97 )   (130 )  (3,782 )  (4,009 ) Balance at December 31, 2014 $53  ($8 )  ($136 )  ($13,812 )  ($13,903 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Net of tax. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Primarily relates to amortization of actuarial losses for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 totaling $661 , $1,516 , and $1,304 (net of tax of ($367) , ($849) , and ($752) ), respectively. These are included in the net periodic pension cost of which a portion is allocated to production as inventoried costs. See Note 14 . ##TABLE_END Note 17  Derivative Financial Instruments Cash Flow Hedges Our cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage currency risk associated with certain transactions, specifically forecasted sales and purchases made in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2019 . We use commodity derivatives, such as swaps and fixed-price purchase commitments to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. Our commodity contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2017 . Fair Value Hedges Interest rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt. The net change in fair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in Boeing Capital interest expense. Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment We also hold certain derivative instruments, primarily foreign currency forward contracts, for risk management purposes that are not receiving hedge accounting treatment. Notional Amounts and Fair Values The notional amounts and fair values of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Notional amounts (1) Other assets Accrued liabilities   2014  2014  Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:          Foreign exchange contracts $2,586  $2,524 $9  $122 ($204 )  ($64 ) Interest rate contracts  10     Commodity contracts  1  (24 )  (39 ) Derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment:          Foreign exchange contracts  21  (5 )  (35 ) Commodity contracts       (4 ) Total derivatives $3,064  $3,177  (233 )  (142 ) Netting arrangements    (16 )  (63 )  Net recorded balance    $25  $86 ($217 ) ($79 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Notional amounts represent the gross contract/notional amount of the derivatives outstanding. ##TABLE_END Gains/(losses) associated with our cash flow and undesignated hedging transactions and their effect on Other comprehensive income/(loss) and Net earnings were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  Effective portion recognized in Other comprehensive income/(loss), net of taxes:    Foreign exchange contracts ($135 )  ($76 ) Commodity contracts (2 )  Effective portion reclassified out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings, net of taxes:    Foreign exchange contracts  Commodity contracts (13 )  (20 ) Forward points recognized in Other income, net:    Foreign exchange contracts  Undesignated derivatives recognized in Other income, net:    Foreign exchange contracts (7 )  ##TABLE_ENDBased on our portfolio of cash flow hedges, we expect to reclassify losses of $98 (pre-tax) out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings during the next 12 months. Ineffectiveness related to our hedges recognized in Other income was insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 . We have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. For foreign exchange contracts with original maturities of at least five years, our derivative counterparties could require settlement if we default on our five-year credit facility. For commodity contracts, our counterparties could require collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and commodity contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at December 31, 2014 was $20 . At December 31, 2014 , there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives. Note 18  Significant Group Concentrations of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments involving potential credit risk are predominantly with commercial aircraft customers and the U.S. government. Of the $11,438 in gross accounts receivable and gross customer financing included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2014 , $5,246 related predominantly to commercial aircraft customers ( $1,664 of accounts receivable and $3,582 of customer financing) and $4,281 related to the U.S. government. Of the $3,582 in gross customer financing, $2,429 related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit including American Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, and United/Continental Airlines who were associated with 11% , 9% and 8% , respectively, of our financing portfolio. Financing for aircraft is collateralized by security in the related asset and in some instances security in other assets as well. Other Risk As of December 31, 2014 , approximately 39% of our total workforce was represented by collective bargaining agreements, the majority of which expire after 2015. Note 19  Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013  Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets         Money market funds $3,826 $3,826   $3,783 $3,783   Available-for-sale investments 7  6  $2 Derivatives  $25   $86  Total assets $3,858 $3,833 $25 $3,877 $3,789 $86 $2          Liabilities         Derivatives ($217 )  ($217 )  ($79 )  ($79 )  Total liabilities ($217 )  ($217 )  ($79 )  ($79 )  ##TABLE_ENDMoney market funds and available-for-sale equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Available-for-sale debt investments are primarily valued using an income approach based on benchmark yields, reported trades and broker/dealer quotes. Derivatives include foreign currency, commodity and interest rate contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve. Certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following table presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended December 31 due to long-lived asset impairment, and the fair value and asset classification of the related assets as of the impairment date: ##TABLE_START    Fair Value  Total Losses  Fair Value  Total Losses Operating lease equipment $187  ($170 )  $216  ($81 ) Property, plant and equipment  (15 )   (15 ) Other assets and Acquired intangible assets  (17 )   Total $206  ($202 )  $256  ($96 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of the impaired operating lease equipment is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of third party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades and other market factors. Management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued appropriateness and consistency with market trends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected net sales price for the aircraft. Property, plant and equipment, Other assets and Acquired intangible assets were primarily valued using an income approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. For Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2014 , the following table presents the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques and related unobservable inputs of those assets. ##TABLE_START  Fair Value  Valuation Technique(s)  Unobservable Input  Range Median or Average Operating lease equipment $187  Market approach  Aircraft value publications  $158 - $268 (1) Median $238   Aircraft condition adjustments  ($58) - $7 (2) Net ($51) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  The range represents the sum of the highest and lowest values for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, according to the third party aircraft valuation publications that we use in our valuation process. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The negative amount represents the sum, for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, of all downward adjustments based on consideration of individual aircraft attributes and condition. The positive amount represents the sum of all such upward adjustments. ##TABLE_END Fair Value Disclosures The fair values and related carrying values of financial instruments that are not required to be remeasured at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2014  Carrying Amount  Total Fair Value  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets          Accounts receivable, net $7,729  $7,845    $7,845   Notes receivable, net       Liabilities          Debt, excluding capital lease obligations (8,909 )  (10,686 )    (10,480 )  ($206 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  December 31, 2013  Carrying Amount  Total Fair Value  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets          Accounts receivable, net $6,546  $6,525    $6,525   Notes receivable, net       Liabilities          Debt, excluding capital lease obligations (9,483 )  (10,897 )    (10,897 )  ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of Accounts receivable is based on current market rates for loans of the same risk and maturities. The fair values of our variable rate notes receivable that reprice frequently approximate their carrying amounts. The fair values of fixed rate notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on current market yields. For our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowing cost derived from dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. The fair values of our debt classified as Level 3 are based on discounted cash flow models using the implied yield from similar securities. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain. Items not included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, Accounts payable and long-term payables. The carrying values of those items, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at December 31, 2014 and 2013 . The fair value of assets and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1). Note 20  Legal Proceedings Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are pending against us. Potentially material contingencies are discussed below. We are subject to various U.S. government investigations, from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such government disputes and investigations will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, except as set forth below. Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made. Employment, Labor and Benefits Litigation In connection with the 2005 sale of the former Wichita facility to Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. (Spirit), on February 16, 2007, an action entitled Harkness et al. v. The Boeing Company et al. was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, alleging collective bargaining agreement breaches and ERISA violations in connection with alleged failures to provide benefits to certain former employees of the Wichita facility. During the second quarter of 2014, the plaintiffs and Boeing agreed to settle the matter, subject to a fairness hearing, which has not been scheduled. The settlement would apply to approximately 2,000 employees who were subsequently employed by Spirit. Spirit is obligated to indemnify Boeing for settlement of this matter, and we intend to pursue full indemnification from Spirit. During the fourth quarter of 2014, Boeing filed a complaint against Spirit in Delaware Superior Court seeking to enforce our rights to indemnification and to recover from Spirit amounts incurred by Boeing for pension and retiree medical obligations. We cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter pending the outcome of the fairness hearing. On October 13, 2006, we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. Plaintiffs, seeking to represent a class of similarly situated participants and beneficiaries in The Boeing Company Voluntary Investment Plan (the VIP), alleged that fees and expenses incurred by the VIP were and are unreasonable and excessive, not incurred solely for the benefit of the VIP and its participants, and were undisclosed to participants. The plaintiffs further alleged that defendants breached their fiduciary duties in violation of 502(a)(2) of ERISA , and sought injunctive and equitable relief pursuant to 502(a)(3) of ERISA . Our motion for summary judgment was denied on December 30, 2014. We expect trial in this matter to begin during the second quarter of 2015. We cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter given the current procedural status of the litigation. Note 21  Segment Information We operate in five principal segments: Commercial Airplanes; Boeing Military Aircraft ( BMA ), Network  Space Systems ( NSS ), and Global Services  Support ( GSS ), collectively Defense, Space  Security ; and Boeing Capital . All other activities fall within Unallocated items, eliminations and other. See page 53 for the Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note. Effective during the first quarter of 2014 , certain programs and contracts were realigned among BDS segments. The BMA Airborne Warning and Control Systems program, F-22 Modernization program and the Airborne Early Warning and Control Peace Eagle contract were realigned from BMA to GSS . Beginning in the third quarter of 2014 , amounts previously reported separately as Other segment and Unallocated items and eliminations are now presented on a combined basis to provide a more meaningful presentation.

For segment reporting purposes, we record Commercial Airplanes segment revenues and cost of sales for airplanes transferred to other segments. Such transfers may include airplanes accounted for as operating leases and considered transferred to the BCC segment and airplanes transferred to the BDS segment for further modification prior to delivery to the customer. The revenues and cost of sales for these transfers are eliminated in the Unallocated items and eliminations caption. For segment reporting purposes, we record BDS revenues and cost of sales for the modification performed on airplanes received from Commercial Airplanes when the airplane is delivered to the customer or at the attainment of performance milestones. Intersegment revenues, eliminated in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, are shown in the following table. ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Commercial Airplanes $1,822  $879  $1,215 Boeing Capital   Total $1,841  $908  $1,264 ##TABLE_ENDUnallocated Items, Eliminations and other Unallocated items, eliminations and other includes costs not attributable to business segments as well as intercompany profit eliminations.

Through 2012, the business segments have been allocated pension and other postretirement benefit costs using U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards ( CAS ), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Beginning in 2013, pension costs, comprising GAAP service and prior service costs, are allocated to Commercial Airplanes. BDS continues to be allocated CAS pension costs which are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs will continue to be allocated to business segments based on CAS , which is generally based on benefits paid. Prior year allocations have not been adjusted.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Boeing Company Chicago, Illinois We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 . The financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework ( 2013 ) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 12, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP  Chicago, Illinois February 12, 2015  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Boeing Company Chicago, Illinois We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 of the Company and our report dated February 12, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP  Chicago, Illinois February 12, 2015  ", "9A": " Item 9A.

The major programs in this segment include for strategic missile and defense systems: Ground-based Midcourse Defense ( GMD ); for space and intelligence systems: commercial, civil and military satellites; and for space exploration: Space Launch System ( SLS ), Commercial Crew and International Space Station. This segment also includes our joint venture operations related to United Launch Alliance . Global Services  Support Segment This segment provides customers with mission readiness through total support solutions. Our global services business sustains aircraft and systems with a full spectrum of products and services through integrated logistics, including supply chain management and engineering support; maintenance, modification and upgrades for aircraft; and training systems and government services, including pilot and maintenance training. GSS international operations include Boeing Defence U.K. Ltd., and Boeing Defence Australia, as well as Alsalam Aircraft Company, Aviation Training International, Ltd and Boeing Sikorsky International Services LLC, joint ventures. Integrated logistics comprises an integrated array of services that address the complete life cycle of aircraft and systems. Major programs supported include the F/A-18E/F, F-15, AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook for domestic and international customers. Aircraft modernization and sustainment is performed at centers throughout the United States and around the world, providing rapid cycle time and aircraft services for military customers on a wide variety of BDS and non- BDS platforms. Major support is performed as part of the C-17 Globemaster III Integrated Sustainment Program. Aircraft programs include the Airborne Early Warning and Control ( AEWC ) Peace Eagle contract with Turkey and Airborne Warning and Control Systems ( AWACS ) program. We delivered the final AEWC aircraft to Turkey in 2015. Training systems and government services comprise a full range of training capabilities for domestic and international customers, including the design and development of trainers for multiple aircraft platforms and logistics and asset management solutions. Boeing Capital Segment BCC seeks to ensure that Boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing product and manages overall financing exposure. BCC s portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases, finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and investments. Financial and Other Business Information See the Summary of Business Segment Data and Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information, including revenues and earnings from operations, for each of our business segments. Intellectual Property We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. Non-U.S. Revenues See Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding non-U.S. revenues. Research and Development Research and development expenditures involve experimentation, design, development and related test activities for defense systems, new and derivative jet aircraft including both commercial and military, advanced space and other company-sponsored product development. These are expensed as incurred including amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on U.S. government contracts. Our total research and development expense, net amounted to $3.3 billion , $3.0 billion and $3.1 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Research and development costs also include bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services, as well as costs incurred in excess of amounts estimated to be recoverable under cost-sharing research and development agreements. Bid and proposal costs were $286 million , $289 million and $285 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Employees Total workforce level at December 31, 2015 was approximately 161,400 . As of December 31, 2015 , our principal collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions: ##TABLE_START Union Percent of our Employees Represented Status of the Agreements with Major Union The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) 22% We have two major agreements; one expiring in June 2022 and one in September 2024. The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) 13% We have two major agreements expiring in Octo ber 2016. The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) 1% We have one major agreement expiring in October 2022. ##TABLE_ENDCompetition The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as Airbus, Embraer and Bombardier, and other entrants from Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with greater value products, services, and support. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which spans the life cycle of the airplane: aircraft acquisition, readying for service, maintenance and engineering, enhancing and upgrading, and transitioning to the next model - as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. BDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company and General Dynamics Corporation. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group, continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In addition, certain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2016 . Regulatory Matters Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our international markets. Government Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default, based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default. Commercial Aircraft. In the U.S., our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Internationally, similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Joint Aviation Authorities. Environmental. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations. A Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site for which we were originally assigned a partial share, the statutory framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. International. Our international sales are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, investment, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. International sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks. Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take one year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of companies. Suppliers We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and program/contract profitability, thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. We are also dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices. Seasonality No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report. Our Commercial Airplanes business depends heavily on commercial airlines, and is subject to unique risks. Market conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft. The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. In addition, availability of financing to non-U.S. customers depends in part on the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally, or in the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period. We enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. In order to account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers. Our Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards. The commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S. suppliers, highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy regulatory and customer requirements, and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. We must meet planned production rate and productivity improvement targets in order to satisfy customer demand and maintain our profitability. We continue to increase production rates for the 737, 767 and 787 programs, while at the same time engaging in significant ongoing development of the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X aircraft. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements, and optimizing how we manage inventory. If production rate ramp-up efforts at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer. Operational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins. Our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory certifications, could result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support costs. Further, if we cannot efficiently and cost-effectively incorporate design changes into early build 787 aircraft, we may face further profitability pressures on this program. If our commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly and technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues. Changes in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the U.S. DoD . Levels of U.S. defense spending in future periods are very difficult to predict and subject to significant risks. In addition, significant budgetary delays and constraints have already resulted in reduced spending levels, and additional reductions may be forthcoming. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act (The Act) established limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending by approximately $490 billion between the 2012 and 2021 U.S. government fiscal years. The Act also provided that the defense budget would face sequestration cuts of up to an additional $500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded. The impact of sequestration cuts has been reduced with respect to FY2016 and FY2017 following the enactment of The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 in November 2015. However, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure, including risk of future sequestration cuts. In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies (including NASA) within the overall budgetary framework described above. While the FY2016 appropriations enacted December 2015 included funding for Boeings major programs, such as F/A-18, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, KC-46A Tanker and P-8 programs, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in FY2017 and beyond will affect Boeings programs. We also expect that ongoing concerns regarding the U.S. national debt will continue to place downward pressure on U.S. DoD spending levels. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorizations and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. In addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both U.S. defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment, we expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. If we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition priorities and/or fail to meet affordability targets set by the U.S. DoD customer, our revenues and market share would be further impacted. We conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks. In 2015 ,  27% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign military sales through the U.S. government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks. Our sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs. New procurement regulations, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our compliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS business. These requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could be subject to additional costs in the form of withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply with these requirements in the future. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as continuing resolutions rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position. We are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S. government contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, routinely audit government contractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false. We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns. Our BDS business generated approximately 72% of its 2015 revenues from fixed-price contracts. While fixed-price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. For example, during the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $835 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract, primarily driven by additional costs attributable to design changes, testing and manufacturing complexity. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance. Fixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker , and commercial and military satellites. We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks. Our BDS business generated approximately 28% of its 2015 revenues from cost-type contracting arrangements. Some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Programs whose contracts are primarily cost-type include GMD , Proprietary and SLS programs. We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks. Contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit payments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite does not perform to specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance. The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees we ultimately expect to realize is recognized as revenue in the construction period. If the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criteria, customers will not be obligated to continue making in-orbit payments and/or we may be required to provide refunds to the customer and incur significant charges. Our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components. We rely on other companies including subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies, and production commodities and to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers or incur additional costs. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum, titanium or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the suppliers control, such as geo-political developments, or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs. For example, we continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results. Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. With respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling and other non-recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes to price escalation indices, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer and supplier negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact these estimates. Any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under Managements Discussion and Analysis  Critical Accounting Policies  Contract Accounting/Program Accounting on pages 44  45 and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 55  66 of this Form 10-K. Competition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell may reduce our future contracts and sales. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasing competition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers and service providers in one or more of our market segments. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation, fewer large and new programs and new priorities, including near and long-term cost competitiveness, of our U.S. DoD and international customers will intensify competition for many of our products and services. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not result in reduced revenues and market share. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries. In 2015 , non-U.S. customers accounted for approximately 59% of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including: ##TABLE_START  changes in regulatory requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  domestic and international government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  fluctuations in international currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  volatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  imposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international conflicts. ##TABLE_END While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future. The outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. We are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the United States and its various states, as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S. government, the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our current or past ownership of certain property. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers based in the United States, and in certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks. A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions, particularly in the United States. Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8F aircraft. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position could be materially adversely affected. We may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , our airplane financing commitments totaled $16,283 million and $16,723 million . If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures. As part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful. We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures. We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. We maintain insurance for certain risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. government. The amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft technologies, missile systems, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims or liabilities. Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses. Our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. Any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of our data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and of our products and services. Some of our and our suppliers workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages. Approximately 61,000 employees, which constitute 38% of our total workforce, were union represented as of December 31, 2015 . We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BMA program production. We may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 11 U.S. labor organizations and 6 non-U.S. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions requirements without impacting our financial condition. The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations. We have substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders ' equity and cash flows from operations and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods. We have qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover the majority of our employees. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and discretionary contributions to improve the plans ' funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions  could have a significant effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders ' equity. For U.S. government contracts, we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. We also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the level of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see  Management ' s Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies - Pension Plans  on pages 46  47 of this Form 10-K. Although GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement benefit contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or past manufacturing operations or the operations of companies we have acquired. In other cases, we may become subject to such costs due to an indemnification agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental liabilities. In addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation requirements could result in additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Unauthorized access to our or our customers information and systems could negatively impact our business. We face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address these threats. While these measures are designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems, certain types of attacks, including cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information technology systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we cannot prevent the unauthorized access, release and/or corruption of our customers confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or we could face financial losses.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in many countries and rely on an extensive network of international partners, key suppliers and subcontractors. Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses  Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space  Security ( BDS )  supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital ( BCC ). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands and we price our products and services to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. Commercial Airplanes is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits us as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets sometimes offset. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers. Consolidated Results of Operations  Earnings From Operations and Core Operating Earnings (Non-GAAP) The following table summarizes key indicators of consolidated results of operations: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except per share data)      Years ended December 31,   Revenues $96,114  $90,762  $86,623       GAAP      Earnings from operations 7,443  7,473  6,562 Operating margins 7.7 %  8.2 %  7.6 % Effective income tax rate 27.7 %  23.7 %  26.4 % Net earnings $5,176  $5,446  $4,585 Diluted earnings per share $7.44  $7.38  $5.96       Non-GAAP (1)      Core operating earnings $7,741  $8,860  $7,876 Core operating margin 8.1 %  9.8 %  9.1 % Core earnings per share $7.72  $8.60  $7.07 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) These measures exclude certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense. See page 43 for important information about these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. ##TABLE_END Revenues  The following table summarizes Revenues: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Commercial Airplanes $66,048  $59,990  $52,981 Defense, Space  Security 30,388  30,881  33,197 Boeing Capital   Unallocated items, eliminations and other (735 )  (525 )  Total $96,114  $90,762  $86,623 ##TABLE_ENDRevenues in 2015  increased by $5,352 million or 6% compared with 2014 . Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $6,058 million or 10%  due to higher new airplane deliveries and mix . BDS revenues decreased by $493 million or 2% due to lower revenues in all three segments. Revenues in 2014 increased by $4,139 million or 5% compared with 2013. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $7,009 million primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries. BDS revenues decreased by $2,316 million due to lower revenues in all three segments. The changes in unallocated items, eliminations and other in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 primarily reflect the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries. Earnings From Operations  The following table summarizes Earnings from operations: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Commercial Airplanes $5,157  $6,411  $5,795 Defense, Space  Security 3,274  3,133  3,235 Boeing Capital   Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense (298 )  (1,387 )  (1,314 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations (740 )  (776 )  (1,261 ) Earnings from operations (GAAP) $7,443  $7,473  $6,562 Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense  1,387  1,314 Core operating earnings (Non-GAAP) $7,741  $8,860  $7,876 ##TABLE_ENDEarnings from operations in 2015  decreased by $30 million compared with 2014 primarily reflecting a fourth quarter charge of $885 million related to the 747 program at Commercial Airplanes and higher charges of $410 million related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker recorded by Commercial Airplanes and our Boeing Military Aircraft ( BMA ) segment, partially offset by lower unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense of $1,089 million . Earnings from operations in 2014 increased by $911 million compared with 2013 primarily reflecting higher earnings at Commercial Airplanes of $616 million and lower unallocated items and eliminations of $485 million. The decrease in unallocated items is due to the A-12 litigation settlement of $406 million which was recorded in 2013 and lower 2014 deferred compensation of $194 million. The A-12 aircraft litigation settlement resulted in the Company recording a $406 million pre-tax charge in 2013, which consisted of writing-off A-12 inventory, recorded as cost of sales, and providing three EA-18G Growlers at no cost to the U.S. Navy, recorded as a reduction in revenues. During the second quarter of 2015 and of 2014 , we recorded reach-forward losses of $835 million and $425 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract. $513 million of the 2015 charge was recorded at Commercial Airplanes and $322 million at our BMA segment. $238 million of the 2014 charge was recorded at Commercial Airplanes and $187 million at our BMA segment. Core operating earnings in 2015  decreased by $1,119 million compared with 2014 primarily due to the 2015 747 charge and higher USAF KC-46A Tanker charges. Core operating earnings in 2014 increased by $984 million compared with 2013 primarily reflecting higher earnings at Commercial Airplanes and the 2013 A-12 charge. Unallocated Items, Eliminations and Other The most significant items included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other are shown in the following table: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Share-based plans ($76 )  ($67 )  ($95 ) Deferred compensation (63 )  (44 )  (238 ) Eliminations and other (601 )  (665 )  (522 ) Litigation settlements   (406 ) Sub-total (included in core operating earnings*) (740 )  (776 )  (1,261 ) Pension (421 )  (1,469 )  (1,374 ) Postretirement   Pension and other postretirement benefit expense (excluded from core operating earnings*) (298 )  (1,387 )  (1,314 ) Total unallocated items, eliminations and other ($1,038 )  ($2,163 )  ($2,575 ) ##TABLE_END* Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense. See page 43 . Deferred compensation expense increased by $19 million in 2015 and decreased by $194 million in 2014, primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions and our stock price. Eliminations and other unallocated expense decreased by $64 million in 2015 primarily due to the timing of the elimination of profit on intercompany aircraft deliveries and expense allocations. The increase of $143 million in 2014 was primarily due to insurance recoveries which were recorded in the third quarter of 2013. Litigation settlements include the 2013 charge of $406 million related to the settlement of the A-12 litigation. Net periodic benefit cost related to pension totaled $2,786 million , $2,208 million and $3,449 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The components of net periodic benefit cost are shown in the following table: ##TABLE_START  Pension Years ended December 31,   Service cost $1,764  $1,661  $1,886 Interest cost 2,990  3,058  2,906 Expected return on plan assets (4,031 )  (4,169 )  (3,874 ) Amortization of prior service costs   Recognized net actuarial loss 1,577  1,020  2,231 Settlement/curtailment/other losses   Net periodic benefit cost $2,786  $2,208  $3,449 ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in 2015 net periodic benefit cost related to pension is primarily due to $557 million of higher amortization of actuarial losses due to lower discount rates. The decrease in 2014 is primarily due to lower amortization of actuarial losses due to higher discount rates which more than offset higher 2014 curtailment charges. A portion of net periodic benefit cost is recognized in Earnings from operations in the period incurred and the remainder is included in inventory at the end of the reporting period and recorded in Earnings from operations in subsequent periods. Costs are allocated to the business segments as described in Note 21 . Net periodic benefit costs included in Earnings from operations were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Pension Years ended December 31,   Allocated to business segments ($1,945 )  ($1,746 )  ($1,662 ) Unallocated items, eliminations and other (421 )  (1,469 )  (1,374 ) Total ($2,366 )  ($3,215 )  ($3,036 ) ##TABLE_ENDUnallocated pension expense recognized in earnings decreased by $1,048 million in 2015 primarily due to lower amortization of pension costs capitalized as inventory in prior years and lower curtailment charges in 2015. Unallocated pension expense in 2014 reflects pension charges of $395 million, primarily for pension curtailment costs. Other Earnings Items ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Earnings from operations $7,443  $7,473  $6,562 Other (loss)/income, net (13 )  (3 )  Interest and debt expense (275 )  (333 )  (386 ) Earnings before income taxes 7,155  7,137  6,232 Income tax expense (1,979 )  (1,691 )  (1,646 ) Net earnings from continuing operations $5,176  $5,446  $4,586 ##TABLE_ENDInterest and debt expense decreased by $58 million in 2015 as a result of higher interest capitalized on construction in progress. Interest and debt expense decreased by $53 million in 2014 as a result of lower weighted average debt balances. Our effective income tax rates were 27.7% , 23.7% and 26.4% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Our 2015 effective tax rate was higher than 2014 primarily due to tax benefits of $524 million recorded in the second quarter of 2014 related to tax basis adjustments and settlement of the 2007 - 2010 federal tax audits. Our 2014 effective tax rate was lower than 2013 primarily due to the tax benefits of $524 million recorded in the second quarter of 2014. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Total Costs and Expenses (Cost of Sales) Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales and BDS predominantly uses contract accounting. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. Under contract accounting, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. The following table summarizes cost of sales: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,  Change   Change Cost of sales $82,088  $76,752 $5,336  $76,752  $73,268 $3,484 Cost of sales as a % of revenues 85.4 %  84.6 % 0.8 %  84.6 %  84.6 % 0.0 % ##TABLE_ENDCost of sales in 2015  increased by $5,336 million , or 7% , compared with the same period in 2014 , primarily driven by the $5,352 million , or 6% , increase in revenues. Cost of sales at Commercial Airplanes increased by $6,846 million , or 14% , primarily driven by the 10% increase in revenues. Cost of sales at BDS  decreased by $252 million , or 1% , primarily due to the 2% reduction in revenues. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was approximately 85.4% in 2015 compared with 84.6% in 2014 primarily driven by the 2015 747 charge and higher KC-46A Tanker charges. Cost of sales in 2014 increased by $3,484 million, or 5%, compared with the same period in 2013, primarily driven by the increase in revenue. Cost of sales at Commercial Airplanes increased by $6,265 million, or 14%, primarily driven by the 13% increase in revenues. Cost of sales at BDS decreased by $2,085 million, or 8%, primarily due to the 7% reduction in revenues. Research and Development The following table summarizes our Research and development expense: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Commercial Airplanes $2,340  $1,881  $1,807 Defense, Space  Security  1,158  1,215 Other   Total $3,331  $3,047  $3,071 ##TABLE_ENDResearch and development expense in 2015  increased by $284 million compared to 2014 primarily due to higher 777X spending at Commercial Airplanes which more than offset lower spending at BDS. Research and development expense in 2014 decreased by $24 million compared to 2013. In 2014 , Commercial Airplanes spending increased on 777X, 787-10 and 737 MAX, partially offset by lower spending on the 787-9. Backlog Our backlog at December 31 was as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)   Contractual Backlog:      Commercial Airplanes $431,408  $440,118  $372,980 Defense, Space  Security:      Boeing Military Aircraft 20,019  21,119  23,580 Network  Space Systems 7,368  8,935  9,832 Global Services  Support 17,800  16,920  16,269 Total Defense, Space  Security 45,187  46,974  49,681 Total contractual backlog $476,595  $487,092  $422,661 Unobligated backlog $12,704  $15,299  $18,267 ##TABLE_ENDContractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The decrease in contractual backlog at December 31, 2015 compared with December 31, 2014 was primarily due to deliveries in excess of net orders. The increase in contractual backlog at December 31, 2014 compared with December 31, 2013 was primarily due to commercial airplane orders and reclassifications from unobligated backlog related to incremental funding. The increase was partially offset by commercial airplane deliveries and revenues recognized on awarded contracts . Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The decreases in unobligated backlog in 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to reclassifications to contractual backlog related to incremental funding for BDS contracts, partially offset by contract awards. Additional Considerations KC-46A Tanker In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force ( USAF ) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development ( EMD ) contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. We have also begun work on low rate initial production ( LRIP ) aircraft for the USAF. The USAF is expected to authorize two low rate initial production lots in 2016 for a total of 19 aircraft, subject to satisfactory progress being made on the EMD contract . In second quarter 2014, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $425 million on the EMD contract. In second quarter 2015, we recorded an additional reach-forward loss of $835 million. $513 million of this loss was recorded at our Commercial Airplanes segment and the remaining $322 million was recorded in our BMA segment. The $835 million loss includes $670 million related to the EMD contract and $165 million related to LRIP aircraft. The reach-forward loss on the EMD contract was driven primarily by design changes required in the aircraft fuels and aerial refueling systems which were identified as we prepared for and conducted ground and flight testing. Other costs include additional qualification and certification testing as well as investments that will enable us to meet our delivery commitments in 2017. The reach-forward loss related to LRIP aircraft was primarily driven by increased manufacturing complexity resulting from design changes. As with any development program, this program remains subject to additional reach-forward losses if we experience technical or quality issues, schedule delays or increased costs. We continue to expect to meet our commitment to deliver 18 fully operational aircraft to the customer by August 2017. The contract contains production options for both LRIP aircraft and full rate production aircraft. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. Russia/Ukraine We continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. A number of our commercial customers also have operations in Russia and Ukraine. To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to production or deliveries. Should suppliers or customers experience disruption, our production and/or deliveries could be materially impacted. Export-Import Bank of the United States Many of our non-U.S. customers finance purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the banks charter on June 30, 2015, the banks charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the banks board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. Certain of our non-U.S. customers also may seek to delay purchases if they cannot obtain financing at reasonable costs, and there may be further impacts with respect to future sales campaigns involving non-U.S. customers. We continue to work with our customers to mitigate risks associated with the lack of a quorum of the banks board of directors and assist with alternative third party financing sources. Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment Global economic activity and global trade, which are the primary drivers of the demand for air travel, grew below the long-term average for the fourth year in a row in 2015. Despite this, passenger traffic continued to grow more than 5%, as it has every year since 2010, and accelerated to more than 6% in 2015. While growth was strong across all major world regions, there continues to be significant variation between regions and airline business models. Airlines operating in the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions as well as low-cost-carriers globally are currently leading passenger growth. Air cargo traffic grew at 5% in the first quarter and 3% in the second quarter of 2015 compared with the same periods in 2014. However, weaker global industrial production and world trade resulted in little to no cargo traffic growth during the remainder of the year. The slowing air cargo market recovery has resulted in reduced orders and demand for new freighter aircraft and freighter conversions, and in January 2016, we announced plans to further reduce production rates on the 747 program. Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also relentlessly focusing on reducing costs by renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airplanes and in 2015 benefited significantly from lower fuel costs. Net profits for the global airline industry are estimated to total $33 billion in 2015 compared to $17 billion in 2014. We expect airline profits to continue to grow in 2016, driven by strong passenger demand and relatively low oil prices. The long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast projects a long-term average growth rate of 4.9% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 3.1% average annual GDP growth, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $5.6 trillion market for approximately 38,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global environmental regulations. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia is enabling low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 11% of Commercial Airplanes contractual backlog, in dollar terms, is with U.S. airlines, including cargo carriers. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and increasingly capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft in the market above 90 seats. Many of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including launch aid, which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airplane development activities and enables airplanes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. Changes in value of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies impact competitors revenues and profits. Many competitors are expected to benefit from the strong U.S. dollar experienced in 2015 and ongoing improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share through pricing and/or improving earnings. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spare parts, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively.

Commercial Airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  *     Total            Cumulative deliveries 5,713  1,519  1,083  1,361    Deliveries (15)  (3)     2014            Cumulative deliveries 5,218  1,501  1,067  1,263    Deliveries (15)  (3)     2013            Cumulative deliveries 4,733  1,482  1,061  1,164    Deliveries (8)     (1)  ##TABLE_END* Intercompany deliveries identified by parentheses ##TABLE_START  Aircraft accounted for as revenues by Commercial Airplanes and as operating leases in consolidation identified by parentheses ##TABLE_END Earnings From Operations  Earnings from operations in 2015  decreased by $1,254 million or 20% compared with 2014 primarily due to higher reach-forward losses of $1,160 million and higher research and development spending of $459 million, largely on the 777X, which more than offset higher new airplane deliveries and mix. During the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a charge of $885 million to recognize a reach-forward loss on the 747 program. In addition, we recorded reach-forward losses on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract of $513 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $238 million in the second quarter of 2014. Operating margins in 2015 decreased primarily due to additional reach-forward losses, higher research and development expense and the dilutive impact of 787 volume and mix. Earnings from operations in 2014 increased by $616 million or 11% compared with 2013. The increase in earnings is primarily due to higher earnings of $947 million driven by higher new airplane deliveries and commercial aviation services revenue growth. This earnings increase was partially offset by a reach- forward loss of $238 million recorded in the second quarter of 2014 related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract and higher research and development expense of $74 million. The increase in research and development reflects higher spending on the 777X, 787-10 and 737 MAX, which more than offset lower 787-9 spending. Operating margins decreased from 10.9% in 2013 to 10.7% in 2014 primarily due to the dilutive impact of 747 and 787 deliveries and the USAF KC-46A Tanker reach-forward loss. Backlog  Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their Board of Directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers. The decrease in contractual backlog during 2015 was due to deliveries in excess of net orders. The increase in contractual backlog during 2014 was due to net orders in excess of deliveries. The decrease in unobligated backlog during 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to the reclassification from unobligated to contractual backlog related to incremental funding of the existing multi-year contract for Commercial Airplanes share of the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a programs life. Estimation of each programs accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. ##TABLE_START  Program   747**    777X  2015            Program accounting quantities 8,400  1,574  1,147  1,650  *  1,300 Undelivered units under firm orders 4,392      Cumulative firm orders 10,105  1,539  1,163  1,579   1,142            Program accounting quantities 7,800  1,574  1,113  1,600  *  1,300 Undelivered units under firm orders 4,299      Cumulative firm orders 9,517  1,537  1,114  1,541   1,071            Program accounting quantities 7,000  1,574  1,113  1,550  *  1,300 Undelivered units under firm orders 3,680      Cumulative firm orders 8,413  1,537  1,110  1,478   1,030 ##TABLE_END* The accounting quantity for the 777X will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020. ** At December 31, 2015 , undelivered 747 units under firm orders include a number of aircraft that are being remarketed. Program Highlights 737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 600 units during 2015 due to the program  s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 42 per month and plan an additional increase to 47 per month in 2017. We plan to further increase the rate to 52 per month in 2018 and to 57 per month in 2019. First delivery of the 737 MAX is expected in 2017. 747 Program Lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower-than-expected growth of global freight traffic have resulted in market uncertainties, ongoing pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated. During the second half of 2015, the cargo market recovery slowed, and in January 2016, we announced a plan to further reduce the production rate to 0.5 per month as well as recognize a reach-forward loss of $885 million on the program. The charge, which was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015, is primarily related to lower anticipated revenues reflecting ongoing pricing and market pressures, as well as higher estimated costs due to the reduced production rate. We are currently producing at a rate of 1.3 per month with plans to reduce the rate to 1.0 per month in March 2016, further reduce the rate to 0.5 per month in September 2016 and then return to 1.0 per month in 2019. We have a number of completed aircraft in inventory as well as unsold production positions and we remain focused on obtaining additional orders and implementing cost-reduction efforts. If we are unable to obtain sufficient orders in 2016 and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, the program could face an additional reach-forward loss that may be material. 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 34 units during 2015 due to the program's progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. We are currently producing at a combined tanker and commercial production rate of 1.5 per month and plan to increase to 2 per month in 2016. We plan to further increase the rate to 2.5 per month in the fourth quarter of 2017. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 50 units during 2015 due to the programs normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 8.3 per month and plan to reduce the rate to 7 per month in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we launched the 777X, which features a new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips. The 777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020. 787 Program We continue to produce at a rate of 10 per month and plan for rate increases to 12 per month in 2016 and 14 per month by the end of the decade. First delivery of the 787-10 derivative aircraft is targeted for 2018. The accounting quantity of 1,300 units remains unchanged. We remain focused on increasing the production rate to 12 per month in 2016 and improving productivity. We continue to monitor and address challenges associated with aircraft production and assembly for both the 787-8 and 787-9, including management of our manufacturing operations and extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work, as well as completing and delivering early build aircraft. In addition, we continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes, including requests for contractual relief related to delivery delays and supplier assertions. During 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs associated with these airplanes were included in research and development expense. Based on sales activity and market interest we continue to believe that the remaining 787 flight-test aircraft are commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to these aircraft in program inventory. However, there is risk that we may be unable to sell these aircraft. If we determine that any of the remaining flight-test aircraft cannot be sold, we would incur additional material charges related to the reclassification of costs associated with those aircraft to research and development expense. The combination of production challenges, change incorporation on early build aircraft, schedule delays, customer and supplier impacts and changes to price escalation factors has created significant pressure on program profitability and we continue to have near breakeven gross margins. If risks related to these challenges, together with risks associated with planned production rate increases, or introducing or manufacturing the 787-10 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions, further pressures on program profitability and/or a reach-forward loss. We continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks. Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. Program Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. Reflects models in development during 2015 We launched the 787-10 in June 2013 and the 777X in November 2013. Additional Considerations The development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Defense, Space  Security Business Environment and Trends United States Government Defense Environment Overview  The enactment of The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 in November 2015 established overall defense spending levels for FY2016 and FY2017. However, uncertainty remains with respect to levels of defense spending for FY2018 and beyond, including risk of future sequestration cuts. Significant uncertainty also continues with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense ( U.S. DoD ) and other government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorization and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. In addition to the risks described above, if Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner, a government shutdown could result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts or program-level appropriations. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. DoD or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders. International Environment Overview The international market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of international opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given the diverse regional threats.

In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Deliveries of units for new-build production aircraft, including remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   F/A-18 Models   F-15 Models   C-17 Globemaster III   CH-47 Chinook (New)   CH-47 Chinook (Renewed)   AH-64 Apache (New)   AH-64 Apache (Remanufactured)   P-8 Models   AEWC    C-40A 1  Total   ##TABLE_ENDRevenues  BDS revenues in 2015  decreased by $493 million compared with 2014 due to lower revenues in all three segments. BDS revenues in 2014 decreased by $2,316 million compared with 2013 primarily due to lower revenues of $1,775 million in the BMA segment and lower revenues of $509 million in the Network  Space Systems ( NSS ) segment. Earnings From Operations  BDS earnings from operations in 2015  increased by $141 million compared with 2014 due to higher earnings in all three segments. Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $49 million  lower in 2015 compared with 2014 , primarily reflecting higher charges of $135 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract recorded at BMA which more than offset higher favorable adjustments in the Global Services  Support ( GSS ) segment. BDS earnings from operations in 2014 decreased by $102 million compared with 2013 due to lower earnings of $200 million and $21 million in the BMA and NSS segments, partially offset by higher earnings of $119 million in the GSS  segment. Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $96 million higher in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily reflecting higher favorable adjustments in the GSS segment. Backlog Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. BDS total backlog was $57,675 million at December 31, 2015 , reflecting a decrease of 7% from December 31, 2014 . BDS total backlog was $61,913 million at December 31, 2014, reflecting a decrease of 8% from December 31, 2013. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional Considerations Our BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense ( GMD ), Proprietary and Space Launch System ( SLS ) programs. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew and commercial and military satellites.

BMA revenues in 2014 decreased by $1,775 million, or 12%, compared with 2013 primarily due to a reduction of revenue of $1,730 million related to F-15 and USAF KC-46A Tanker milestones, fewer C-17 aircraft deliveries and delivery mix on the P-8 program. Earnings From Operations  BMA earnings from operations in 2015  increased by $17 million compared with 2014 primarily due to lower C-17 charges, higher Chinook deliveries and higher earnings on the F-15 program, primarily due to a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2015. These increases were partially offset by higher charges of $135 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract and lower earnings on proprietary programs. BMA recorded charges of $322 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $187 million in the second quarter of 2014 related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract. In addition, BMA recorded a charge of $48 million in the first quarter of 2014 to write-off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of our decision to produce three fewer C-17 aircraft in 2015 than previously planned. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $96 million  lower in 2015 than in 2014 primarily driven by the USAF KC-46A Tanker charges and lower favorable F/A-18 adjustments, partially offset by higher favorable F-15 program adjustments. BMA earnings from operations in 2014 decreased by $200 million, or 13%, compared with 2013 primarily due to 2014 charges of $235 million and lower earnings of $73 million related to fewer deliveries on the C-17 program. The charges recorded in 2014 included $187 million related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract and $48 million to write off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of our 2014 decision to produce three fewer C-17 aircraft in 2015 than previously planned. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. These decreases were partially offset by higher earnings of $65 million related to improved performance on the F/A-18 program. In addition, in 2013, we recorded a charge of $64 million to write off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of the Republic of Korea's announcement to restart its F-X fighter aircraft competition. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $39 million lower in 2014 than in 2013 primarily driven by the reach-forward loss on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract, partially offset by higher favorable adjustments to the F/A-18 and F-15 programs. Backlog BMA total backlog at December 31, 2015 was $27,170 million , a decrease of 7% reflecting revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by contract awards for the F-15, Apache, C-17 and F/A-18 programs. BMA total backlog at December 31, 2014 was $29,139 million, a decrease of 13% reflecting revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by contract awards for the F/A-18, P-8 and Apache programs.

Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $10 million  lower in 2015 than in 2014 primarily due to higher unfavorable adjustments on commercial satellite programs. NSS earnings from operations in 2014 decreased by $21 million compared with 2013 primarily due to lower earnings of $84 million on several commercial satellite programs related to lower milestone volume, partially offset by higher earnings of $68 million due to improved performance on several government satellite programs and our ULA joint venture as well as higher volume on Commercial Crew during the initial performance period. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $12 million higher in 2014 than in 2013. NSS earnings from operations include equity earnings of $183 million , $211 million and $171 million primarily from our ULA joint venture in 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Backlog NSS total backlog was $12,347 million at December 31, 2015 , reflecting a decrease of 17% from December 31, 2014 primarily due to revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by current year contract awards including orders from NASA for International Space Station engineering support and Post Certification Mission 1 on the Commercial Crew program. NSS total backlog was $14,922 million at December 31, 2014, reflecting a decrease of 6% from December 31, 2013 primarily due to revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by current year contract awards for the Commercial Crew, commercial satellite and missile defense system programs.

GSS revenues in 2014 decreased by $32 million compared with 2013 primarily due to lower volume of $277 million in IL and TSGS programs. These decreases were partially offset by higher Aircraft Modernization  Sustainment ( AMS ) revenues of $245 million primarily related to deliveries of three AEWC Peace Eagle to Turkey in 2014. Earnings From Operations  GSS earnings from operations in 2015  increased by $96 million compared with 2014 primarily due to improved performance across the segment. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $57 million higher in 2015 than in 2014 primarily due to favorable F-15 program adjustments.  GSS earnings from operations in 2014 increased by $119 million, or 12%, compared with 2013 primarily due to an increase of $145 million related to improved performance in several MMU programs, most notably the AEWC Peace Eagle contract. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $123 million higher in 2014 than in 2013 primarily due to unfavorable adjustments on the AEWC Peace Eagle contract in 2013.  Backlog GSS total backlog at December 31, 2015 was $18,158 million , an increase of 2% reflecting current year contract awards, including C-17 support programs, Advanced Surveillance Command and Control and F-15 support programs, partially offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years. GSS total backlog at December 31, 2014 was $17,852 million , which was largely unchanged from backlog of $17,736 million at December 31, 2013. Boeing Capital Business Environment and Trends BCCs gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2015 totaled $3,459 million . A substantial portion of BCCs portfolio is concentrated among certain U.S. commercial airline customers. BCCs portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8F aircraft. BCC provided customer financing of $586 million and $489 million during 2015 and 2014 . While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2016, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,300 western-built commercial jet aircraft ( 9.5% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2015 , including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 11% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2014 and 2013 , 9.8% and 9.2% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. Results of Operations ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Revenues $413  $416  $408 Earnings from operations $50  $92  $107 Operating margins %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDRevenues  BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and notes, and other income. BCC s revenues in 2015 are consistent with 2014. BCC s revenues in 2014 increased by $8 million compared with 2013 primarily due to higher aircraft return condition payments of $60 million, partially offset by a decrease in finance lease income and lower interest income. Earnings From Operations  BCCs earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2015  decreased by $42 million compared with 2014 primarily due to higher asset impairment expense. Earnings from operations in 2014 decreased by $15 million compared with 2013 due to $60 million increase in asset impairment expense, partially offset by a reduction in the provision for losses on receivables, driven by a change to a customer credit rating recorded in the first quarter of 2014, in addition to lower depreciation and interest expense.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , BCC had $49 million and $48 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease, of which $15 million in 2015 had either signed preliminary agreements with deposits or firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $111 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2016 . We are seeking to remarket these aircraft or have the leases extended. BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment.

The increase of $0.5 billion in 2015 was primarily due to lower inventory growth, partially offset by lower receipts of advances and progress billings. The increase of $0.7 billion in 2014 was primarily due to higher customer advances which more than offset higher gross inventory. Our investment in gross inventories decreased by $0.3 billion in 2015 primarily in our BDS business, largely driven by ending production of C-17 aircraft, which more than offset continued investment in commercial airplane program inventory. Our investment in gross inventories increased $7.6 billion in 2014 and $5.7 billion in 2013 , largely driven by continued investment in commercial airplane program inventory, primarily 787 inventory. Advances and progress billings increased by $0.4 billion in 2015 , $6.9 billion in 2014 and $3.9 billion in 2013 , primarily due to payments from Commercial Airplane customers. Discretionary contributions to our pension plans were insignificant in 2015 compared with $0.8 billion in 2014 and $1.5 billion  in 2013 . Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities was $1.8 billion during 2015 compared with $2.5 billion provided during 2014 and $5.2 billion used during 2013 , largely due to changes in investments in time deposits. Net proceeds from investments were $0.6 billion in 2015 compared with $4.8 billion in 2014 and net contributions to investments of $2.9 billion in 2013 . In 2015 , capital expenditures totaled $2.5 billion , up from $2.2 billion in 2014 and $2.1 billion in 2013 . We expect capital expenditures in 2016 to be consistent with 2015 due to continued investment to support growth. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $7.9 billion during 2015 , a decrease of $0.7 billion compared with 2014 primarily due to higher new borrowings of $0.8 billion and lower repayments of debt and distribution rights of $0.9 billion in 2015 , which more than offset higher share repurchases of $0.8 billion and higher dividend payments of $0.4 billion in 2015 . Cash used by financing activities was $8.6 billion during 2014, an increase of $4.3 billion compared with 2013 primarily due to higher share repurchases of $3.2 billion, higher dividends paid of $0.6 billion and a decrease in proceeds from stock options exercised of $0.8 billion in 2014, partially offset by higher new borrowings of $0.4 billion in 2014. During 2015 , we issued $1.7 billion and repaid $0.9 billion of debt. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 the recorded balance of debt was $10.0 billion and $9.1 billion of which $1.2 billion and $0.9 billion was classified as short-term. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 this includes $2.4 billion of debt attributable to BCC , of which $0.5 billion and $0.1 billion was classified as short-term. During 2015 and 2014 we repurchased 46.7 million and 46.6 million shares totaling $6.8 billion and $6.0 billion through our open market share repurchase program. In 2015 and 2014 , we had 0.7 million shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At December 31, 2015 , the amount available under the share repurchase plan, announced on December 14, 2015, totaled $14 billion . Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that continues to serve as a significant potential source of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2015 and at December 31, 2015 , we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $5.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. Financing commitments totaled $16.3 billion and $16.7 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In addition, many of our non-U.S. customers finance aircraft purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the banks charter on June 30, 2015, the banks charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the banks board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , our pension plans were $17.9 billion and $17.3 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2015 with minimal required contributions in 2016 . We expect to make contributions to our plans of approximately $0.1 billion in 2016 . We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years. At December 31, 2015 , we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2015 , and the estimated timing thereof. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Total  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  3-5 years  After 5 years Long-term debt (including current portion) $9,922  $1,186  $996  $2,358  $5,382 Interest on debt (1) 5,580     3,554 Pension and other postretirement cash requirements 14,146   1,718  4,222  7,566 Capital lease obligations     Operating lease obligations 1,529     Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position 123,100  43,471  31,741  24,465  23,423 Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position 16,580  15,358    Total contractual obligations (2) $171,014  $61,413  $36,609  $32,181  $40,811 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2015 . Variable rate debt was 3% of our total debt at December 31, 2015 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Excludes income tax matters. As of December 31, 2015 , our net liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions, was $1,177 million . We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. ##TABLE_END Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation. Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2015 , we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2015 , we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $18.4 billion that extend through 2030 . Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2015 . ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Total Amounts Committed/Maximum Amount of Loss  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  4-5 years  After 5 years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $4,968  $3,127  $1,355  $182  $304 Commercial aircraft financing commitments 16,283  2,897  6,899  4,205  2,282 Total commercial commitments $21,251  $6,024  $8,254  $4,387  $2,586 ##TABLE_ENDCommercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contingent Obligations We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $566 million at December 31, 2015 . For additional information, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We have $1,617 million of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015 for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-GAAP Measures Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the impact of certain pension and other postretirement benefit expenses that are not allocated to business segments - see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts. Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures The table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of earnings from operations, operating margins and diluted earnings per share. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except per share data)    Years ended December 31,   Revenues $96,114  $90,762  $86,623 Earnings from operations, as reported $7,443  $7,473  $6,562 Operating margins 7.7 %  8.2 %  7.6 %       Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense $298  $1,387  $1,314 Core operating earnings (non-GAAP) $7,741  $8,860  $7,876 Core operating margins (non-GAAP) 8.1 %  9.8 %  9.1 %       Diluted earnings per share, as reported $7.44  $7.38  $5.96 Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense (1) $0.28  $1.22  $1.11 Core earnings per share (non-GAAP) $7.72  $8.60  $7.07 Weighted average diluted shares (in millions) 696.1  738.0  769.5 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Earnings per share impact is presented net of the federal statutory rate of 35.0%. ##TABLE_END Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting Contract accounting is used to determine revenue, cost of sales, and profit predominantly by our BDS business. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contracts inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts decreased Earnings from operations by $224 million . For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts increased Earnings from operations by $100 million and $242 million . Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS for all of 2015 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $304 million . In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower initial margins than established programs. In addition, actual costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity are included within program inventory as deferred production costs. Deferred production, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements are realized. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins. If the combined gross margin percentages for our commercial airplane programs had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would have a similar effect on the Commercial Airplane segments operating margins. For the year-ended December 31, 2015, a 1% increase or decrease in operating margins for our Commercial Airplane segment would have a $650 million impact on operating earnings. The 747 is in a reach-forward loss position at December 31, 2015 while the 787 program had near breakeven margins during 2015. Absent changes in estimated revenues or costs, subsequent 747 deliveries are recorded at zero margin. Reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately as an additional reach-forward loss. If we are unable to mitigate risks associated with the 747 and 787 programs, or if we are required to change one or more of our pricing, cost or other assumptions related to these programs, we could be required to record additional reach-forward losses which could have a material effect on our reported results. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any. We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2015 and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2015 , we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had $490 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets. Pension Plans The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans will transition to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders equity. The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2015 . ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Change in discount rate Increase 25 bps  Change in discount rate Decrease 25 bps Pension plans    Projected benefit obligation ($2,128 )  $2,648 Net periodic pension cost (129 )  ##TABLE_ENDPension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2015 net periodic pension expense by $148 million . We expect 2016 net periodic pension cost to decrease by approximately $2,119 million and the portion recognized in earnings to decrease by approximately $378 million primarily due to lower service cost and amortization of actuarial losses. Other Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Act), require disclosure of certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran that occurred during the period covered by this report. Disclosure is required even if the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. We have disclosed such activities in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2015 and such disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we agreed to sell aircraft maintenance manuals to Iran Air Tours. We generated no revenues or net profits during the fourth quarter of 2015 from these activities. These sales were authorized by a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Boeing applied for the OFAC license consistent with guidance from the U.S. government in connection with ongoing negotiations between the P5+1 nations and Iran related to, among other things, the safety of Irans civil aviation industry. We may engage in additional activities pursuant to this license, which sales may require additional disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Act. ", "7A": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2015 , the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2015 , a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $229 million . Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. ", "8": " Item 8.

The Boeing Company and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013  (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as Boeing, the Company, we, us, or our). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. During 2015 we adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Income Taxes, which requires that the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position reflect all deferred income tax assets and liabilities as non-current. The Company elected to retrospectively apply the provisions of this standard and prior year balances have been revised to reflect the current year presentation. Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The new standard was originally effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption was not permitted. On August 12, 2015, the FASB approved a one year delay of the effective date to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, while permitting companies to voluntarily adopt the new standard as of the original effective date. The comprehensive new standard will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance and require revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Adoption of the new rules could affect the timing of revenue recognition for certain transactions. The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards. The Company is currently evaluating when to adopt the new standard, the impacts of adoption and the implementation approach to be used. Use of Estimates Management makes assumptions and estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Those assumptions and estimates directly affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant estimates for which changes in the near term are considered reasonably possible and that may have a material impact on the financial statements are disclosed in these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Cycle For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year . Revenue and Related Cost Recognition Contract Accounting Contract accounting is used for development and production activities predominantly by Defense, Space  Security ( BDS ). The majority of business conducted by BDS is performed under contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that extend over several years. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales and costs for each contract resulting in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. When the current estimates of total sales and costs for a contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contracts percent complete. In 2015 , net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts decreased Earnings from operations by $224 and diluted EPS by $0.23 . In 2014 and 2013 net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts increased Earnings from operations by $100 and $242 and diluted EPS by $0.10 and $0.23 . Significant adjustments during the three years ended December 31, 2015 included reach-forward losses of $835 and $425 on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract recorded during 2015 and 2014 . We combine contracts for accounting purposes when they are negotiated as a package with an overall profit margin objective. These essentially represent an agreement to do a single project for a single customer, involve interrelated construction activities with substantial common costs, and are performed concurrently or sequentially. When a group of contracts is combined, revenue and profit are earned uniformly over the performance of the combined contracts. Similarly, we may segment a single contract or group of contracts when a clear economic decision has been made during contract negotiations that would produce different rates of profitability for each element or phase of the contract. Sales related to fixed-price contracts are recognized as deliveries are made, except for certain fixed-price contracts that require substantial performance over an extended period before deliveries begin, for which sales are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones. Sales related to contracts in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if specified targets are achieved. Incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated and are probable are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded. Program Accounting Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales related to its programs. Program accounting is applicable to products manufactured for delivery under production-type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contracts and years. Under program accounting, inventoriable production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced, and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. We recognize sales for commercial airplane deliveries as each unit is completed and accepted by the customer. Sales recognized represent the price negotiated with the customer, adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. The amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effects on program margins are recognized prospectively except in cases where the program is determined to have a reach-forward loss in which case the loss is recognized in the current period. See Note 11 . Concession Sharing Arrangements We account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their purchase of products and services as a reduction to revenue when the related products and services are delivered. The sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendors products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products. Spare Parts Revenue We recognize sales of spare parts upon delivery and the amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost. Service Revenue Service revenue is recognized when the service is performed with the exception of U.S. government service agreements, which are accounted for using contract accounting. Service activities primarily include: support agreements associated with military aircraft and helicopter contracts, space travel on Commercial Crew, ongoing maintenance of International Space Station, and technical and flight operation services for commercial aircraft. Service revenue and associated cost of sales from pay-in-advance subscription fees are deferred and recognized as services are rendered. Financial Services Revenue We record financial services revenue associated with sales-type/finance leases, operating leases, and notes receivable. Lease and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type/finance leases, we record an asset at lease inception. This asset is recorded at the aggregate future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur. For operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets, included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated residual value, using the straight-line method. We periodically review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense. For notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note. Reinsurance Revenue Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Astro Ltd., participates in a reinsurance pool for workers compensation. The member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $136 , $135 and $160 during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were $132 , $144 and $147 during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Revenues and costs are presented net in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fleet Support We provide assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation to the operators of all our commercial airplane models. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, and technical consulting support. This activity continues throughout the aircrafts operational life. Services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire models fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services. Research and Development Research and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design, and testing, as well as bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers. Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with our contract accounting policy. We have certain research and development arrangements that meet the requirement for best efforts research and development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expense rather than as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of $286 , $289 and $285 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. We have established cost sharing arrangements with some suppliers for the 787 program. Our cost sharing arrangements state that the supplier contributions are for reimbursements of costs we incur for experimentation, basic design, and testing activities during the 787 development. In each arrangement, we retain substantial rights to the 787 part or component covered by the arrangement. The amounts received from these cost sharing arrangements are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses since we have no obligation to refund any amounts received per the arrangements regardless of the outcome of the development efforts. Specifically, under the terms of each agreement, payments received from suppliers for their share of the costs are typically based on milestones and are recognized as earned when we achieve the milestone events and no ongoing obligation on our part exists. In the event we receive a milestone payment prior to the completion of the milestone, the amount is classified in Accrued liabilities until earned. Share-Based Compensation We provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value net of estimated forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. Income Taxes Provisions for federal, state, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Earnings before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. Tax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of Income tax expense. Postretirement Plans The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans will transition to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. We also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employees annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). A portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and reflected in inventory at the end of a reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in Shareholders equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities we amortize them over the average future service period of employees. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Postemployment Plans We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated. Environmental Remediation We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations, and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup, and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be able to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable were $163 and $241 at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Inventories Inventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe benefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries and plant services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costs include amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one year. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering. Commercial aircraft programs inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production costs represent actual costs incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costs are experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor and other resources) than units produced later in a program because of volume efficiencies and the effects of learning. We expect that these deferred costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive from suppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier advances are amortized to work in process. The determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision is recorded. The determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimate revenue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity. When estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. Used aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value. See Aircraft Valuation within this Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or net realizable value. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired inventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs. Included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the ability to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwise recoverable, it would be written off in the current period. We net advances and progress billings on long-term contracts against inventory in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Advances and progress billings in excess of related inventory are reported in Advances and billings in excess of related costs. Precontract Costs We may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recovery from future orders, then we capitalize the precontract costs we incur, excluding start-up costs which are expensed as incurred. Capitalized precontract costs are included in Inventories, net of advances and progress billings, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Should future orders not materialize or we determine the costs are no longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and equipment, from 4 to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over 5 years. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition. Long-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Long-lived assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Asset Retirement Obligations We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material. We also have known conditional asset retirement obligations, such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liabilitys fair value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1. We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology, from 5 to 14 years; product know-how, from 6 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 19 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 27 years; and other, from 3 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Investments Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost. Available-for-sale securities include commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized based on the specific identification method. Available-for-sale securities are assessed for impairment quarterly. The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between 20% and 50% . We classify investment income and loss on our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on whether the investment is operating or non-operating in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, including our share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from certain cost method investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic purposes. Earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on marketable securities, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in Other income/(expense), net. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them. We use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes in fair value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is to include in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For our cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss of a cash flow hedge is reported in earnings immediately. We have agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives and international business requirements. These agreements are derivatives for accounting purposes but are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We also hold certain derivative instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For these aluminum agreements and for other derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings immediately. Aircraft Valuation Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments. Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of: ##TABLE_START (1) adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recognized upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) charges to cost of products for adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in Accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_END The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customers requirements; or the scrap market. Trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market or using current published third-party aircraft valuations based on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individual attributes and known conditions. Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer financing. Customer financing Customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/finance leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary. We assess the fair value of the assets we own, including equipment under operating leases, assets held for sale or re-lease, and collateral underlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are less than the related assets carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fair values of sales-type/finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables. We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications. Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Allowance for losses on customer financing receivables We record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in a valuation account, the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to two components of receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables. We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the receivable agreement, without regard to any subsequent restructurings. Factors considered in assessing collectability include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. We determine a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral we would expect to realize. We review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables (after excluding receivables subject to a specific impairment allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for each customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, for example, permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall. Each quarter we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables. Warranties In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material and design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a three to four -year standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards under our authorization. These warranties are included in the programs estimate at completion. On occasion we have made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warranties issued by our BDS segments principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons hardware and are included in the contract cost estimates. These sales are generally accompanied by a six month to two -year warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate. We provide guarantees to certain commercial airplane customers which include compensation provisions for failure to meet specified aircraft performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets, and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of the related aircraft. We have agreements that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to customers for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as a reduction in Cost of products at delivery of the related aircraft. These performance warranties and claims against suppliers are included in the programs estimate at completion. Supplier Penalties We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully anticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts. Guarantees We record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. For a residual value guarantee where we received a cash premium, the liability is equal to the cash premium received at the guarantees inception. For credit guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditors default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable, for each future period the credit guarantee will be outstanding. If at inception of a guarantee, we determine there is a probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value of the guarantee as described above or (b) the probable contingent loss amount. Note 2  Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Commercial Airplanes  Boeing Military Aircraft  Network  Space Systems  Global Services  Support  Total Balance at January 1, 2014 $2,108  $964  $1,513  $458  $5,043 Acquisitions     Goodwill adjustments (22 )   (4 )   (26 ) Balance at December 31, 2014 $2,131  $964  $1,566  $458  $5,119 Acquisitions 15   Goodwill adjustments (14 )  (14 ) Balance at December 31, 2015 $2,123  $979 $1,566 $458 $5,126 ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had indefinite-lived intangible assets with carrying amounts of $490 relating to trade names.

Note 3  Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earnings per share for common shares and participating securities. The undistributed earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed earnings. Basic earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. The elements used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In millions - except per share amounts)       Years ended December 31,   Net earnings $5,176  $5,446  $4,585 Less: earnings available to participating securities   Net earnings available to common shareholders $5,172  $5,440  $4,578 Basic      Basic weighted average shares outstanding 688.0  728.9  760.8 Less: participating securities 1.1  1.3  1.9 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 686.9  727.6  758.9 Diluted      Basic weighted average shares outstanding 688.0  728.9  760.8 Dilutive potential common shares (1) 8.1  9.1  8.7 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 696.1  738.0  769.5 Less: participating securities 1.1  1.3  1.9 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 695.0  736.7  767.6 Net earnings per share:      Basic $7.52  $7.47  $6.03 Diluted 7.44  7.38  5.96 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Diluted earnings per share includes any dilutive impact of stock options, restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and performance awards. ##TABLE_END The following table includes the number of shares that may be dilutive potential common shares in the future.

Research tax credits for the 2013 and 2012 tax years were both recorded in 2013. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  In 2013, we recorded $212 for the issuance of favorable regulations related to research and experimental (RE) expenditures. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  In the second quarter of 2014 we recorded an incremental tax benefit of $265 related to the application of a 2012 Federal Court of Claims decision which held that the tax basis in certain assets could be increased and realized upon the assets' disposition (tax basis adjustment). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  In the second quarter of 2014, tax benefits of $116 and $143 were recorded as a result of the 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 federal tax audit settlements. ##TABLE_END Federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2011. The years 2011-2012 are currently being examined by the IRS. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2001-2015 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years. Prior year balances of deferred tax (liabilities)/assets have been revised to reflect current year presentation. Significant components of our deferred tax (liabilities)/assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Inventory and long-term contract methods of income recognition (10,401 )  (10,156 ) Pension benefits 6,303  6,145 Retiree health care benefits 2,513  2,572 Fixed assets, intangibles and goodwill (net of valuation allowance $16 and $18) (1,837 )  (1,782 ) Other employee benefits 1,339  1,477 Customer and commercial financing (777 )  (853 ) Accrued expenses and reserves  Net operating loss, credit and capital loss carryovers (net of valuation allowance of $89 and $63) (1)  Other (92 )  (292 ) Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets (2) ($2,127 )  ($1,890 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Of the deferred tax asset for net operating loss and credit carryovers, $208 expires in years ending from December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2035 and $8 may be carried over indefinitely. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Included in the net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are deferred tax assets in the amounts of $7,277 and $8,007 related to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. ##TABLE_END Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Deferred tax assets $13,128  $14,219 Deferred tax liabilities (15,150 )  (16,028 ) Valuation allowance (105 )  (81 ) Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets ($2,127 )  ($1,890 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As discussed in Note 1, during the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company retrospectively adopted ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The effects of the accounting change on the December 31, 2014 Statement of Financial Position were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Revised As Reported Current deferred tax asset $18 Non-current deferred tax asset 6,576 Current deferred tax liability (8,484 ) Non-current deferred tax liability (2,207 ) Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets ($1,890 ) ($1,890 ) ##TABLE_ENDWe have provided for U.S. deferred income taxes and foreign withholding tax in the amount of $35 on undistributed earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding tax on the remainder of undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries of approximately $700 because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that may be payable upon distribution. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position were not significant. The amounts of interest benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 . A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: ##TABLE_START    Unrecognized tax benefits  January 1 $1,312  $1,141  $1,055 Gross increases  tax positions in prior periods   Gross decreases  tax positions in prior periods (25 )  (251 )  (125 ) Gross increases  current-period tax positions   Gross decreases  current-period tax positions   (1 ) Settlements  (197 )  Lapse of statute of limitations  (1 )  Unrecognized tax benefits  December 31 $1,617  $1,312  $1,141 ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1,617 , $1,312 and $1,141 , respectively, of which $1,479 , $1,180 and $1,018 would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. As of December 31, 2015 , these amounts are primarily associated with U.S. federal tax issues such as the amount of research tax credits claimed, the U.S. manufacturing activity tax benefit, tax basis adjustments and U.S. taxation of foreign earnings. Also included in these amounts are accruals for domestic state tax issues such as the allocation of income among various state tax jurisdictions and the amount of state tax credits claimed. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will resolve the matters presently under consideration for the 2011-2012 tax years with the IRS. Depending on the timing and outcome of that audit settlement, unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $115 based on current estimates. Note 5  Accounts Receivable, net Accounts receivable at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   U.S. government contracts $4,864  $4,281 Commercial Airplanes 2,250  1,749 Defense, Space  Security customers (1)  1,018 Reinsurance receivables  Other  Less valuation allowance (94 )  (127 ) Total $8,713  $7,729 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Excludes U.S. government contracts ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes our accounts receivable under long-term contracts that were unbillable or related to outstanding claims as of December 31 : ##TABLE_START  Unbillable  Claims     Current $2,024  $2,306   $29 Expected to be collected after one year 2,001  1,408  $70  Total $4,025  $3,714  $70  $102 ##TABLE_ENDUnder contract accounting unbillable receivables on long-term contracts arise when the sales or revenues based on performance attainment, though appropriately recognized, cannot be billed yet under terms of the contract as of the balance sheet date. Any adjustment for the credit quality of unbillable receivables, if required, would be recorded as a direct reduction of revenue. Factors considered in assessing the collectability of unbillable receivables include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. Unbillable receivables related to commercial customers expected to be collected after one year were  $178 and $172 at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Accounts receivable related to claims are items that we believe are earned, but are subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate realization. Accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015 , includes $104 of unbillable receivables on a long-term contract with New LightSquared, LLC (LightSquared) related to the construction of two commercial satellites. One of the satellites has launched and has been accepted by the customer, and the other is substantially complete but remains in Boeings possession. On May 14, 2012, LightSquared filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On December 7, 2015, LightSquared exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and fully assumed the Boeing contract. We do not expect to incur losses on these receivables. Accounts receivable, other than those described above, expected to be collected after one year are not material. Note 6  Inventories Inventories at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Long-term contracts in progress $13,858  $13,381 Commercial aircraft programs 55,230  55,220 Commercial spare parts, used aircraft, general stock materials and other 6,673  7,421 Inventory before advances and progress billings 75,761  76,022 Less advances and progress billings (28,504 )  (29,266 ) Total $47,257  $46,756 ##TABLE_ENDLong-Term Contracts in Progress Long-term contracts in progress includes Delta launch program inventory that is being sold at cost to United Launch Alliance ( ULA ) under an inventory supply agreement that terminates on March 31, 2021. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the inventory balance was $120 (net of advances of $310 ) and $154 (net of advances of $322 ). At December 31, 2015 , $176 of this inventory related to unsold launches. See Note 12 . Included in inventories are capitalized precontract costs of $732 at December 31, 2015 , primarily related to KC-46A Tanker and $1,281 at December 31, 2014 , primarily related to C-17. See Note 11 . Commercial Aircraft Programs At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 787 program: $34,656 and $33,163 of work in process (including deferred production costs of $28,510 and $26,149 ), $2,551 and $2,257 of supplier advances, and $3,890 and $3,801 of unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs. At December 31, 2015 , $23,721 of 787 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and $8,679 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 747 program: $942 and $1,741 of deferred production costs, net of reach-forward losses, and $377 and $476 of unamortized tooling costs. At December 31, 2015 , $342 of 747 deferred production and unamortized tooling costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and $977 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. At December 31, 2015 we have a number of completed 747 aircraft in work in process inventory that we expect to recover from future orders. Commercial aircraft programs inventory included amounts credited in cash or other consideration (early issue sales consideration) to airline customers totaling $3,166 and $3,341 at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Used aircraft in inventories at Commercial Airplanes totaled $267  and $275  at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Note 7  Customer Financing Customer financing primarily relates to the Boeing Capital (BCC) segment and consisted of the following at December 31: ##TABLE_START   Financing receivables:    Investment in sales-type/finance leases $1,620  $1,535 Notes  Total financing receivables 1,876  1,905 Operating lease equipment, at cost, less accumulated depreciation of $338 and $571 1,710  1,677 Gross customer financing 3,586  3,582 Less allowance for losses on receivables (16 )  (21 ) Total $3,570  $3,561 ##TABLE_ENDThe components of investment in sales-type/finance leases at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Minimum lease payments receivable $1,537  $1,475 Estimated residual value of leased assets  Unearned income (447 )  (461 ) Total $1,620  $1,535 ##TABLE_ENDOperating lease equipment primarily includes large commercial jet aircraft and regional jet aircraft. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , operating lease equipment included $49 and $48 available for sale or re-lease. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had firm lease commitments for $15 and $0 of this equipment. Financing receivable balances evaluated for impairment at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Individually evaluated for impairment $86  $86 Collectively evaluated for impairment 1,790  1,819 Total financing receivables $1,876  $1,905 ##TABLE_ENDWe determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had no material receivables that were greater than 30 days past due and we had no impaired customer financing receivables during 2015 and 2014. Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Income is recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer. For the year ended December 31, 2013, interest income recognized on such receivables was $30 , and the average recorded investment in impaired financing receivables was $376 . The change in the allowance for losses on financing receivables for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    Beginning balance - January 1 ($21 )  ($49 )  ($60 ) Customer financing valuation benefit   Ending balance - December 31 ($16 )  ($21 )  ($49 ) Collectively evaluated for impairment ($16 )  ($21 )  ($49 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customer financing receivables are customer credit ratings, default rates and collateral values. We assign internal credit ratings for all customers and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers. Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies. Our financing receivable balances at December 31 by internal credit rating category are shown below: ##TABLE_START Rating categories  BBB $973  $1,055 BB  B  CCC  Other  Total carrying value of financing receivables $1,876  $1,905 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2015 , our allowance related to receivables with ratings of B, BB and BBB. We applied default rates that averaged 16% , 10% and 2% to the exposure associated with those receivables. Customer Financing Exposure Customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance and overall market conditions and may be subject to reduced valuation with market decline. Declines in collateral values are also a significant driver of our allowance for losses. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have experienced greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft. Our customer financing portfolio is primarily collateralized by out-of-production aircraft. The majority of customer financing carrying values are concentrated in the following aircraft models at December 31: ##TABLE_START   717 Aircraft ($372 and $421 accounted for as operating leases) $1,415  $1,562 747 Aircraft (Accounted for as operating leases) 1,038  MD-80 Aircraft (Accounted for as sales-type finance leases)  757 Aircraft ($48 and $349 accounted for as operating leases)  767 Aircraft ($84 and $47 accounted for as operating leases)  737 Aircraft ($115 and $127 accounted for as operating leases)  MD-11 Aircraft (Accounted for as operating leases)  ##TABLE_ENDCharges related to customer financing asset impairment for the years ended December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Boeing Capital $162  $139  $67 Other Boeing   Total $162  $184  $81 ##TABLE_ENDScheduled receipts on customer financing are as follows: ##TABLE_START Year      Beyond 2020 Principal payments on notes receivable $54  $38  $104  $56  $4  Sales-type/finance lease payments receivable      $450 Operating lease equipment payments receivable      ##TABLE_ENDNote 8  Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Land $536  $560 Buildings and land improvements 12,397  11,767 Machinery and equipment 13,187  12,867 Construction in progress 2,242  1,502 Gross property, plant and equipment 28,362  26,696 Less accumulated depreciation (16,286 )  (15,689 ) Total $12,076  $11,007 ##TABLE_ENDDepreciation expense was $1,357 , $1,414 and $1,338 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Interest capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $158 , $102 and $87 , respectively. Rental expense for leased properties was $267 , $277 and $287 , for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. At December 31, 2015 , minimum rental payments under capital leases aggregated $157 . Minimum rental payments under operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more aggregated $1,515 , net of sublease payments of $13 at December 31, 2015 . Payments due under operating and capital leases net of sublease amounts and non-cancellable future rentals during the next five years are as follows: ##TABLE_START      Minimum operating lease payments, net of sublease amounts $240  $217  $182  $157  $117 Minimum capital lease payments     ##TABLE_ENDAccounts payable related to purchases of property, plant and equipment were $502 and $299 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Note 9  Investments Our investments, which are recorded in Short-term and other investments or Investments, consisted of the following at December 31: ##TABLE_START   Time deposits $456  $1,295 Pledged money market funds (1)  Available-for-sale investments  Equity method investments (2) 1,230  1,114 Restricted cash (3)  Other investments  Total $2,034  $2,513 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Reflects amounts pledged in lieu of letters of credit as collateral in support of our workers compensation programs. These funds can become available within 30 days notice upon issuance of letters of credit. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Dividends received were $239 and $293 during 2015 and 2014 . Retained earnings at December 31, 2015 include undistributed earnings from our equity method investments of $251 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Restricted to pay certain claims related to workers compensation and life insurance premiums for certain employees. ##TABLE_END Equity Method Investments Our equity method investments consisted of the following as of December 31: ##TABLE_START  Segment Ownership Percentages  Investment Balance      United Launch Alliance Network  Space Systems (NSS) 50%  $908  $916 Other Commercial Airplanes, NSS and Global Services  Support (GSS)    Total equity method investments   $1,230  $1,114 ##TABLE_ENDNote 10  Other Assets Sea Launch At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , Other assets included $356 of receivables related to our former investment in the Sea Launch venture which became payable by certain Sea Launch partners following Sea Launchs bankruptcy filing in June 2009. The $356 includes $147 related to a payment made by us under a bank guarantee on behalf of Sea Launch and $209 related to loans (partner loans) we made to Sea Launch. The net amounts owed to Boeing by each of the partners are as follows: S.P. Koroley Rocket and Space Corporation Energia of Russia  $223 , PO Yuzhnoye Mashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukraine  $89 and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine  $44 . Although each partner is contractually obligated to reimburse us for its share of the bank guarantee, the Russian and Ukrainian partners have raised defenses to enforcement and contested our claims. On February 1, 2013, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launch partners of the $147 bank guarantee payment and the $209 partner loan obligations. On September 28, 2015, the district court granted summary judgment in Boeings favor on all claims against the other partners. Further proceedings will determine the final damage amount, including potential interest payments. If the partners decide to appeal or seek reconsideration of the district courts ruling additional proceedings would ensue. Prior to these proceedings, we had filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce seeking reimbursement from the other partners for a portion of these amounts. In 2010, the arbitrator ruled that the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter, which ruling has been on appeal in the Swedish appellate courts since mid-2014. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Supreme Court of Sweden confirmed our right to pursue this appeal in the Swedish appellate courts . We believe the partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and remedies. In the event we are unable to secure reimbursement of $147 related to our payment under the bank guarantee and $209 related to partner loans made to Sea Launch, we could incur additional charges. Our current assessment as to the collectability of these receivables takes into account the current economic conditions in Russia and Ukraine, although we will continue to monitor the situation. Spirit AeroSystems As of December 31, 2015, Other assets included $140 of receivables related to an indemnification from Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. (Spirit), for costs incurred related to pension and retiree medical obligations of former Boeing employees that were subsequently employed by Spirit. During the fourth quarter of 2014, Boeing filed a complaint against Spirit in Delaware Superior Court seeking to enforce our rights to indemnification and to recover from Spirit amounts incurred by Boeing for pension and retiree medical obligations. We expect to fully recover from Spirit and do not expect to incur any losses. Note 11  Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Accrued compensation and employee benefit costs $5,624  $5,868 Environmental  Product warranties 1,485  1,504 Forward loss recognition  Dividends payable  Income Taxes Payable  Other 4,599  4,319 Total $14,014  $13,462 ##TABLE_ENDEnvironmental The following table summarizes environmental remediation activity during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 . ##TABLE_START   Beginning balance  January 1 $601  $649 Reductions for payments made (78 )  (89 ) Changes in estimates  Ending balance  December 31 $566  $601 ##TABLE_ENDThe liabilities recorded represent our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred to remediate sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios that includes the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. There are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by $853 and $874 . Product Warranties The following table summarizes product warranty activity recorded during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 . ##TABLE_START   Beginning balance  January 1 $1,504  $1,570 Additions for current year deliveries  Reductions for payments made (323 )  (432 ) Changes in estimates (117 )  (200 ) Ending balance - December 31 $1,485  $1,504 ##TABLE_ENDCommercial Aircraft Commitments In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and airline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer. Trade-in commitment agreements at December 31, 2015 have expiration dates from 2016 through 2026 . At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , total contractual trade-in commitments were $1,585 and $2,392 . As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we estimated that it was probable we would be obligated to perform on certain of these commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling $240 and $446 and the fair value of the related trade-in aircraft was $240 and $446 . Financing Commitments Financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, totaled $16,283 and $16,723 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 . The estimated earliest potential funding dates for these commitments as of December 31, 2015 are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Total $2,897 3,664 3,235 2,884 1,321 Thereafter 2,282  $16,283 ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2015 , $15,919 of these financing commitments related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. We have concluded that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralization and interest rates, under which funding would be provided. Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $4,968 and $3,985 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Commitments to ULA We and Lockheed Martin Corporation have each committed to provide ULA with additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. As of December 31, 2015 , ULAs total remaining obligation to Boeing under the inventory supply agreement was $120 . See Note 6 . C-17 Production of the C-17 aircraft ended in the fourth quarter of 2015. At December 31, 2015 , one aircraft remained unsold, while our backlog includes international orders for four C-17 aircraft that are scheduled for delivery in 2016. During 2015 we received orders for six C-17 aircraft and we believe it is probable that we will receive an order for the remaining unsold aircraft from an international customer. Should an order not materialize we could incur charges to write down inventory. F/A-18 At December 31, 2015 , our backlog included 48 F/A-18 aircraft under contract with the U.S. Navy. The orders in backlog include an order for 15 aircraft finalized in October 2015. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, passed in December 2015, funds 12 additional F/A-18 aircraft that, combined with the orders in backlog, would complete production in mid-2018. The Presidents Fiscal Year 2017 Budget request submitted in February 2016 includes funding for two additional F/A-18 aircraft. We are continuing to work with our U.S. customers as well as international customers to secure additional orders that would extend the program beyond 2018. Should additional orders not materialize, it is reasonably possible that we will decide to end production of the F/A-18 in 2018. We are still evaluating the full financial impact of a potential production shutdown, including any recovery that may be available from the U.S. government. KC-46A Tanker We have also begun work on low rate initial production aircraft for the U.S. Air Force ( USAF ). The USAF is expected to authorize two  low rate initial production lots in 2016 for a total of 19 aircraft, subject to satisfactory progress being made on the Engineering, Manufacturing and Development contract. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $429 of capitalized precontract costs and $1,589 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers associated with the KC-46A Tanker. Company Owned Life Insurance McDonnell Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life insurance policies with a cash surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the cash surrender value was $487 and $466 and the total loans were $456 and $439 . As we have the right to offset the loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 . United States Government Defense Environment Overview The enactment of The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 in November 2015 established overall defense spending levels for FY2016 and FY2017. However, uncertainty remains with respect to levels of defense spending for FY2018 and beyond, including risk of future sequestration cuts. Significant uncertainty also continues with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) and other government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorization and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. In addition to the risks described above, if Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner, a government shutdown could result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts or program-level appropriations. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. DoD or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders. KC-46A Tanker and BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work. BDS fixed-price contracts with significant development work include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker and commercial and military satellites. The operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost and revenue estimates could result in lower margins or material charges for reach-forward losses. For example, during the second quarter of 2015, higher estimated costs to complete the KC-46A Tanker contract for the USAF resulted in a reach-forward loss of $835 . Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts Our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve for amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide refunds to the U.S. government. Russia/Ukraine We continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. A number of our commercial customers also have operations in Russia and Ukraine. To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to production or deliveries. Should suppliers or customers experience disruption, our production and/or deliveries could be materially impacted. 747 Program During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a charge of $885 to recognize a reach-forward loss on the 747 program primarily due to slower than expected growth in global cargo markets, resulting in market and pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated driving reductions in our planned production rates. The charge is primarily related to lower anticipated revenues reflecting ongoing pricing and market pressures as well as higher estimated costs due to the reduction in the production rate from 1.0 per month to 0.5 per month in September 2016 . We currently plan to return to a rate of 1.0 per month in 2019. We have a number of completed aircraft in inventory as well as unsold production positions and we remain focused on obtaining additional orders and implementing cost-reduction efforts. If we are unable to obtain sufficient orders in 2016 and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, the program could face an additional reach-forward loss that may be material. 787 Program During 2015 the 787 program continued to have near breakeven gross margins. The combination of production challenges, change incorporation on early build aircraft, schedule delays, customer and supplier impacts and changes to price escalation factors has created significant pressure on program profitability. If risks related to this program, including risks associated with planned production rate increases or introducing and manufacturing the 787-10 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions, as well as a reach-forward loss that may be material. Note 12  Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees. The following table provides quantitative data regarding our third party guarantees. The maximum potential payments represent a worst-case scenario, and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset our payments under guarantees.

Estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date. Indemnifications to ULA In 2006, we agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 of Boeing Delta launch program inventory included in contributed assets plus $1,860 of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021 . Since inception, ULA has consumed $1,253 of the $1,360 of inventory that was contributed by us and has yet to consume $107 . Under the inventory supply agreement, we have recorded revenues and cost of sales of $1,367 through December 31, 2015 . ULA has made payments of $1,740 to us under the inventory supply agreement and we have made $71 of indemnification payments to ULA. We agreed to indemnify ULA against potential losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the USAF for four satellite missions. We believe ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing. In December 2008, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value for two satellite missions. In March 2009, the USAF issued a denial of that claim. In June 2009, ULA filed a notice of appeal, and in October 2009, ULA filed a complaint before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) for a contract adjustment for the price of the two satellite missions. In September 2009, the USAF exercised its option for a third satellite mission. During the third quarter of 2010, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value of the third mission. The USAF did not exercise an option for a fourth mission prior to the expiration of the contract. In March 2011, ULA filed a notice of appeal before the ASBCA, seeking to re-price the third mission. On November 20, 2013, the ASBCA denied USAF motions for summary judgment against ULA in large part, leaving ULA s claims against the USAF substantially intact. The hearing before the ASBCA concluded on December 20, 2013. The parties filed their final post-hearing briefs in May 2014. The ASBCA may now issue a decision at any time. If ULA is ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining additional pricing, we may be responsible for an indemnification payment up to $261 and may record up to $277 in pre-tax losses associated with the three missions. Potential payments for Other Delta contracts include $85 related to deferred support costs and $91 related to deferred production costs. In June 2011, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) notified ULA that it had determined that $271 of deferred support costs are not recoverable under government contracts. In December 2011, the DCMA notified ULA of the potential non-recoverability of an additional $114 of deferred production costs. ULA and Boeing believe that all costs are recoverable and in November 2011, ULA filed a certified claim with the USAF for collection of deferred support and production costs. The USAF issued a final decision denying ULAs certified claim in May 2012. On June 14, 2012, Boeing and ULA filed a suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking recovery of the deferred support and production costs from the U.S. government. On November 9, 2012, the U.S. government filed an answer to our claim and asserted a counterclaim for credits that it alleges were offset by deferred support cost invoices. We believe that the U.S. governments counterclaim is without merit, and have filed an answer challenging it on multiple grounds. The litigation is in the discovery phase and the Court has not yet set a trial date. If, contrary to our belief, it is determined that some or all of the deferred support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record pre-tax losses and make indemnification payments to ULA for up to $317 of the costs questioned by the DCMA. Other Indemnifications In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and our Commercial Airplanes facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 11 . Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees, principally to facilitate the sale and/or financing of commercial aircraft. Under these arrangements, we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that lease or loan payments are not made by the original lessee or debtor or certain specified services are not performed. A substantial portion of these guarantees has been extended on behalf of original lessees or debtors with less than investment-grade credit. Our commercial aircraft credit guarantees are collateralized by the underlying commercial aircraft and certain other assets. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire within the next five years. Industrial Revenue Bonds Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by the City of Wichita and St. Louis County were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property at our Wichita and St. Louis sites. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a ten-year property tax abatement and a sales tax exemption from the Kansas Department of Revenue, and a twelve-year property tax abatement and sales tax exemption from St. Louis County. We record these properties on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, along with capital lease obligations to repay the proceeds of the IRBs. We have also purchased the IRBs and therefore are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the properties purchased with the IRB proceeds. The capital lease obligations and IRB assets are recorded net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the assets and liabilities associated with the City of Wichita and St. Louis County IRBs were $584 and $638 . Note 13  Debt On February 20, 2015 , we issued $750 of fixed rate senior notes consisting of $250 due March 1, 2025 that bear an annual interest rate of 2.5% , $250 due March 1, 2035 that bear an annual interest rate of 3.3% , and $250 due March 1, 2045 that bear an annual interest rate of 3.5% . The notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds of the issuance totaled $722 , after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. On October 29, 2015 , we issued $900 of fixed rate senior notes consisting of $350 due October 30, 2020 that bear an annual interest rate of 1.65% , $250 due October 30, 2022 that bear interest at the rate of 2.2% , and $300 due October 30, 2025 that bear interest at the rate of 2.6% . The notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds of the issuance totaled $881 , after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. Interest incurred, including amounts capitalized, was $497 , $504 and $548 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Interest expense recorded by BCC is reflected as Boeing Capital interest expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Total Company interest payments were $488 , $511 and $551 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. We have $4,980 currently available under credit line agreements, of which $2,465 is a 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in November 2016 and $2,365 expires in November 2020 , $90 in November 2019 , and $60 in November 2017 . The 364-day credit facility has a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration date. We continue to be in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt or credit facility agreements. Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Unsecured debt securities $1,004  $755 Non-recourse debt and notes  Capital lease obligations  Other notes  Total $1,234  $929 ##TABLE_ENDDebt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Unsecured debt securities    Variable rate: 3-month USD LIBOR plus 12.5 basis points due 2017 $250  $250 0.95% - 4.88% due through 2045 5,075  4,223 5.88% - 6.88% due through 2043 2,381  2,394 7.25% - 8.75% due through 2043 1,645  1,657 Non-recourse debt and notes    6.98% - 7.38% notes due through 2021  Capital lease obligations due through 2024  Other notes  Total debt $9,964  $9,070 ##TABLE_ENDTotal debt is attributable to: ##TABLE_START   BCC $2,355  $2,412 Other Boeing 7,609  6,658 Total debt $9,964  $9,070 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2015 , $163 of debt (non-recourse debt, notes and capital lease obligations) was collateralized by customer financing assets totaling $295 .

Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans will transition to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans participants, and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for future benefit payments. We also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for approximately half those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered by most United Auto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage. The funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). We have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Other assets, and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in Accrued liabilities. The components of net periodic benefit cost were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits Years ended December 31,      Service cost $1,764  $1,661  $1,886  $140  $129  $148 Interest cost 2,990  3,058  2,906    Expected return on plan assets (4,031 )  (4,169 )  (3,874 )  (8 )  (8 )  (6 ) Amortization of prior service costs/(credits)    (136 )  (144 )  (180 ) Recognized net actuarial loss 1,577  1,020  2,231    Settlement/curtailment/other losses      Net periodic benefit cost $2,786  $2,208  $3,449  $285  $275  $320             Net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations $2,366  $3,215  $3,036  $288  $287  $353 ##TABLE_ENDIn 2015 , we recorded charges of $290  related to curtailments and other benefit changes associated with certain of our defined benefit plans. The following tables show changes in the benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status of both pensions and OPB for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Benefit obligation balances presented below reflect the PBO for our pension plans, and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations (APBO) for our OPB plans. ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits     Change in benefit obligation        Beginning balance $78,391  $68,625  $7,306  $7,008 Service cost 1,764  1,661   Interest cost 2,990  3,058   Plan participants contributions    Amendments (1,379 )   (19 )  (43 ) Actuarial (gain)/loss (3,505 )  10,655  (89 )  Settlement/curtailment/other (457 )  (2,518 )   Gross benefits paid (3,382 )  (3,126 )  (486 )  (449 ) Subsidies      Exchange rate adjustment (39 )  (21 )  (15 )  (8 ) Ending balance $74,388  $78,391  $7,138  $7,306 Change in plan assets        Beginning balance at fair value $61,119  $58,131  $141  $140 Actual return/(loss) on plan assets (701 )  5,893   Company contribution    Plan participants contributions    Settlement payments (649 )  (640 )   Benefits paid (3,284 )  (3,039 )  (20 )  (19 ) Exchange rate adjustment (35 )  (16 )   Ending balance at fair value $56,514  $61,119  $132  $141 Amounts recognized in statement of financial position at December 31 consist of:        Other assets $10  $3     Other accrued liabilities (101 )  (93 )  ($390 )  ($363 ) Accrued retiree health care   (6,616 )  (6,802 ) Accrued pension plan liability, net (17,783 )  (17,182 )     Net amount recognized ($17,874 )  ($17,272 )  ($7,006 )  ($7,165 ) ##TABLE_ENDAmounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits     Net actuarial loss $20,871  $21,321  $781  $877 Prior service costs/(credits) (1,195 )   (397 )  (512 ) Total recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss $19,676  $21,706  $384  $365 ##TABLE_ENDThe estimated amount that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during the year ending December 31, 2016 is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits Recognized net actuarial loss $787  $22 Amortization of prior service costs/(credits)  (126 ) Total $825  ($104 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for all pension plans was $72,330 and $75,655 at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Key information for our plans with ABO in excess of plan assets as of December 31 was as follows: ##TABLE_START   Projected benefit obligation $74,188  $78,358 Accumulated benefit obligation 72,121  75,622 Fair value of plan assets 56,306  61,082 ##TABLE_ENDAssumptions The following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31 of each year and the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year. ##TABLE_START December 31,   Discount rate:      Pension 4.20 %  3.90 %  4.80 % Other postretirement benefits 3.80 %  3.50 %  4.20 % Expected return on plan assets 7.00 %  7.00 %  7.50 % Rate of compensation increase 4.00 %  3.80 %  4.00 % ##TABLE_ENDThe discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high quality bonds that are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yields developed from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. A portfolio of about 400 bonds is used to construct the yield curve. Since corporate bond yields are generally not available at maturities beyond 30 years, it is assumed that spot rates will remain level beyond that 30-year point. The present value of each plans benefits is calculated by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows. All bonds are U.S. issues, with a minimum outstanding of $50. The pension funds expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the upcoming plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five -year moving average of plan assets. As of December 31, 2015 , the MRVA was approximately $2,731 greater than the fair market value of assets. Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows: ##TABLE_START December 31,   Health care cost trend rate assumed next year 6.50 %  7.00 %  7.00 % Ultimate trend rate 5.00 %  5.00 %  5.00 % Year that trend reached ultimate rate   ##TABLE_ENDAssumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. To determine the health care cost trend rates we look at a combination of information including ongoing claims cost monitoring, annual statistical analyses of claims data, reconciliation of forecast claims against actual claims, review of trend assumptions of other plan sponsors and national health trends, and adjustments for plan design changes, workforce changes, and changes in plan participant behavior. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect: ##TABLE_START  Increase  Decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost $54  ($44 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation  (551 ) ##TABLE_ENDPlan Assets Investment Strategy The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified. We periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investment benchmarks for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced on a monthly basis. The actual and target allocations by asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Actual Allocations  Target Allocations Asset Class    Fixed income %  %  %  % Global equity    Private equity    Real estate and real assets    Hedge funds (1)    Total %  %  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  As of January 1, 2015 the global strategies asset class was consolidated with the hedge funds asset class. ##TABLE_END Fixed income securities are invested primarily in a diversified portfolio of long duration instruments. Global equity securities are invested in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various industries and market capitalizations. Real estate and real assets include global private investments that may be held through an investment in a limited partnership (LP) or other fund structures and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the case of real estate). Real estate includes, but is not limited to, investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include, but are not limited to, investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber), commodities and infrastructure. Private equity investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) and fund-of-funds that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies. Hedge fund investments seek to capitalize on inefficiencies identified across and within different asset classes or markets. Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to directional, event driven, relative value, long-short and multi-strategy. Investment managers are retained for explicit investment roles specified by contractual investment guidelines. Certain investment managers are authorized to use derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve the desired market exposure of a security or an index, transfer value-added performance between asset classes, achieve the desired currency exposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation. As a percentage of total pension plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were 13.1% and 3.5% for fixed income, including to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and 4.0% and 2.0% for global equity and commodities at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Risk Management In managing the plan assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach and are integral to the overall investment strategy. Further, asset classes are constructed to achieve diversification by investment strategy, by investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored regularly through the custodian. Credit parameters for counterparties have been established for managers permitted to trade over-the-counter derivatives. Valuation is governed through several types of procedures, including reviews of manager valuation policies, custodian valuation processes, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconciliation, and periodic, security-specific valuation testing . Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 . The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. We have retrospectively adopted ASU No. 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that calculate Net Asset Value Per Share . The fair value hierarchy now excludes certain investments which are valued using Net Asset Value (NAVs) as a practical expedient. ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014  Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fixed income securities:         Corporate $16,339 $16,336 $3 $17,488 $17,486 $2 U.S. government and agencies 4,801 4,800 5,224 5,224 Mortgage backed and asset backed 382 1,207 611 Municipal 1,475 1,475 1,636  1,636 Sovereign 907 1,073  1,073  Other 9 246 237 Derivatives:         Assets 25 49 Liabilities (67 ) (67 ) (66 ) (66 ) Cash equivalents and other short-term investments 1,015 1,015 792 Equity securities:         U.S. common and preferred stock (1) 5,165 5,164 7,605 7,605 Non-U.S. common and preferred stock 5,712 5,710 7,151 7,139 1 Derivatives:         Assets 11 9 Liabilities (3 ) (3 ) (5 ) (5 ) Private equity (1) 3 3 Real estate and real assets:         Real estate 447 500 Real assets 351 6 369 4 Derivatives:         Assets 3 2 Liabilities (2 ) (2 ) (11 ) (11 ) Total $37,376 $11,681 $25,231 $464 $43,646 $15,622 $27,403 $621          Fixed income common/collective/pooled funds $1,753    $2,127    Fixed income other       Equity common/collective pooled funds 4,948    2,658    Private equity 2,611    2,924    Real estate and real assets 3,637    3,523    Hedge funds 5,478    5,620    Total investments measured at NAV as a practical expedient $18,674    $17,104             Cash $162    $115    Receivables       Payables (133 )    (193 )    Total $56,514    $61,119    ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Level 1 private equity securities have been reclassified to U.S. common and preferred stock. These are publicly traded equities that were distributed from private equity LPs. ##TABLE_END Fixed income securities are primarily valued upon a market approach, using matrix pricing and considering a securitys relationship to other securities for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or an income approach, converting future cash flows to a single present value amount. Inputs used in developing fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads. Common/collective/pooled funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their NAVs that are calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives included in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued using an income approach with inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates. Exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Cash equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingled fund (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued daily using a market approach with inputs that include quoted market prices for similar instruments. In the event a market price is not available for instruments with an original maturity of one year or less, amortized cost is used as a proxy for fair value. Common and preferred stock equity securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Private equity and private debt NAV valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) we use NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Real estate and real asset NAV valuations are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) NAVs are adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Publicly traded REITs and infrastructure stocks are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Hedge funds consist of direct hedge funds and fund-of-fund limited liability company (LLC) structures. For direct hedge funds the NAVs are generally based on valuation of the underlying investments. This is primarily done by applying a market or income valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument held. The NAVs of the fund-of-funds are based on the NAVs of the underlying hedge funds as well as any cash and accruals held at the fund-of-fund level. Redemptions in hedge funds are based on specific terms and conditions of the individual funds. Investments in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the General Partner (GP), fund manager or third party administrator. Additionally, some investments in fixed income and equity are made via commingled vehicles and are valued in a similar fashion. Pension assets invested in commingled and limited partnership structures rely on the NAV of these investments as the practical expedient for the valuations. The following tables present a reconciliation of Level 3 assets (excluding investments which are valued using NAVs as a practical expedient) held during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Transfers into and out of Level 3 are reported at the beginning-of-year values. ##TABLE_START  January 1 2015 Balance  Net Realized and Unrealized (Losses)  Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements  Net Transfers Into Level 3  December 31 2015 Balance Fixed income securities:          Corporate (1) $1    $1  $1  $3 U.S. government and agencies (1)        Mortgage backed and asset backed (1)  ($9 )  (157 )   Other   (3 )     Equity securities:         U.S. common and preferred stock        Non-U.S. common and preferred stock   (2 )   Private equity     Real assets     Total $621  ($12 )  ($153 )  $8  $464 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  January 1 2014 Balance  Net Realized and Unrealized Gains  Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements  Net Transfers Into/(Out of) Level 3  December 31 2014 Balance Fixed income securities:          Corporate (2) $19   ($7 )  ($10 )  $2 Mortgage backed and asset backed (2)  $14    Equity securities:          Non-U.S. common and preferred stock    (1 )   Private equity      Real assets      Total $577  $14  $6  $24  $621 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Certain fixed income securities were reclassified from corporate and mortgage backed and asset backed to U.S. government and agencies on January 1, 2015. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Certain fixed income securities were reclassified from corporate to mortgage backed and asset backed on January 1, 2014. ##TABLE_END The changes in unrealized (losses)/gains for Level 3 mortgage backed and asset backed fixed income securities still held at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were ($10)  and  $8 . OPB Plan Assets The majority of OPB plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised of approximately 60% equities and 40% debt securities. The index fund is valued using a market approach based on the quoted market price of an identical instrument (Level 1). The expected rate of return on these assets does not have a material effect on the net periodic benefit cost. Cash Flows Contributions Required pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ), as well as rules governing funding of our non-U.S. pension plans, are expected to be minimal in 2016 . In 2016 we expect to make contributions to our pension plans of approximately $100 . Estimated Future Benefit Payments The table below reflects the total pension benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants share of the cost, which is funded by participant contributions. OPB payments reflect our portion only. ##TABLE_START Year(s)      2021-2025 Pensions $4,311  $4,419  $4,479  $4,451  $4,488  $22,724 Other postretirement benefits:            Gross benefits paid      3,139 Subsidies (38 )  (38 )  (38 )  (37 )  (37 )  (177 ) Net other postretirement benefits $483  $508  $536  $558  $589  $2,962 ##TABLE_ENDTermination Provisions Certain of the pension plans provide that, in the event there is a change in control of the Company which is not approved by the Board of Directors and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required by ERISA , and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits in our group insurance benefit programs. We have an agreement with the U.S. government with respect to certain pension plans. Under the agreement, should we terminate any of the plans under conditions in which the plans assets exceed that plans obligations, the U.S. government will be entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plans assets based on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts. Defined Contribution Plans We provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expense for these defined contribution plans was $768 , $764 and $742 in 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Note 15  Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements Share-Based Compensation Our 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated, permits awards of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or units, performance shares, performance restricted stock or units, performance units and other stock and cash-based awards to our employees, officers, directors, consultants, and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock authorized for issuance under the plan is 87,000,000 . Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfy these issuances during 2016 . Share-based plans expense is primarily included in General and administrative expense since it is incentive compensation issued primarily to our executives. The share-based plans expense and related income tax benefit were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Stock options $30  $62  $93 Restricted stock units and other awards   Share-based plans expense $190  $195  $206 Income tax benefit $68  $70  $76 ##TABLE_ENDStock Options In February 2013, we granted to our executives 6,591,968 options. The options have been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. The stock options vest over a period of three years, with 34% vesting after the first year, 33% vesting after the second year and the remaining 33% vesting after the third year. If an executive terminates employment for any reason, the non-vested portion of the stock option will not vest and all rights to the non-vested portion will terminate. We discontinued granting options in 2014, replacing them with performance-based restricted stock units. Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Shares  Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share  Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years)  Aggregate Intrinsic Value Number of shares under option:        Outstanding at beginning of year 18,504,645  $73.75     Exercised (5,369,947)  74.40     Forfeited (206,433)  76.14     Expired (2,321)  77.95     Outstanding at end of year 12,925,944  $73.44  5.23  $920 Exercisable at end of year 11,249,575  $72.94  4.93  $806 ##TABLE_ENDThe total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $385 , $250 and $546 , respectively. Cash received from options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $399 , $343 and $1,097 with a related tax benefit of $135 , $87 and $190 , respectively, derived from the compensation deductions resulting from these option exercises. At December 31, 2015 , there was $4 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to our stock option plan which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two months . The grant date fair value of stock options vested during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $56 , $87 and $89 , respectively. The stock options granted in February 2013 had a fair value of $15.85 which was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected life of 6 years , expected volatility of 29.0% based upon our historical stock volatility, risk-free interest rates of 1.0% , and expected dividend yield of 2.6% . The expected volatility of the stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock volatility and the volatility levels implied on the grant date by actively traded option contracts on our common stock. We determined the expected term of the stock option grants to be six years, calculated using the simplified method in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 110. We use the simplified method since we changed the vesting terms, tax treatment and the recipients of our stock options beginning in 2006 such that we believe our historical data prior to 2006 does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term and we do not have enough option exercise data from our grants issued subsequent to 2006 to support our own estimate as a result of vesting terms and changes in the stock price. Restricted Stock Units In February 2015, 2014 and 2013 , we granted to our executives 590,778 , 695,651 and 1,375,414  restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of $154.64 , $129.58 and $75.97 per unit, respectively. The RSUs granted under this program will vest and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. In addition to RSUs awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant RSUs to certain executives and employees to encourage retention or to reward various achievements. These RSUs are labeled other RSUs in the table below. The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average of the high and low stock prices on the date of grant. RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 was as follows: ##TABLE_START  Long-Term Incentive Program  Other Number of units:    Outstanding at beginning of year 3,032,539  1,147,098 Granted 634,960  223,282 Dividends 64,705  28,849 Forfeited (128,628 )  (64,542 ) Distributed (1,256,936 )  (213,686 ) Outstanding at end of year 2,346,640  1,121,001 Unrecognized compensation cost $92  $43 Weighted average remaining contractual life (years) 1.8  2.0 ##TABLE_ENDThe number of vested but undistributed RSUs at December 31, 2015 was not significant. Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PBRSUs) are stock units that pay out based on the Companys total shareholder return as compared to a group of peer companies over a three-year period. The award payout can range from 0% to 200% of the initial PBRSU grant, but will not exceed 400% of the initial value (excluding dividend equivalent credits). The PBRSUs granted under this program will vest at the payout amount and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) remains eligible under the award and, if the award is earned, will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the PBRSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. In February 2015 and 2014, we granted to our executives 556,203 and 662,215 PBRSUs as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of $164.26 and $136.12 per unit. Compensation expense for the award is recognized over the three-year performance period based upon the grant date fair value estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The model used the following assumptions in 2015 and 2014: expected volatility of 20.35% and 24.2% based upon our historical stock volatility, risk-free interest rates of 1.03% and 0.72% , and no expected dividend yield because the units earn dividend equivalents. PBRSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 was as follows: ##TABLE_START   Long-Term Incentive Program Number of units:   Outstanding at beginning of year  623,102 Granted  556,203 Dividends  25,887 Forfeited  (82,157 ) Outstanding at end of year  1,123,035 Unrecognized compensation cost  $82 Weighted average remaining contractual life (years)  1.8 ##TABLE_ENDOther Compensation Arrangements Performance Awards Performance Awards are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a three-year period. Each unit has an initial value of $100 dollars. The amount payable at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars per unit, depending on the Companys performance against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to pay these awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on the estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period. During 2015, 2014 and 2013 , we granted Performance Awards to our executives with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals for each three -year period following the grant date. The minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out for the 2015, 2014 and 2013 Performance Awards is $349 , $327 and $255 , respectively. The 2013 grant is expected to be paid out in cash in March 2016 . Deferred Compensation The Company has a deferred compensation plan which permits executives to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus, and certain other incentive awards. Participants can diversify deferred compensation among 23 investment funds including a Boeing stock unit account. Total expense related to deferred compensation was $63 , $44 and $238 in 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the deferred compensation liability which is being marked to market was $1,191 and $1,234 . Note 16  Shareholders Equity On December 14, 2015, the Board approved a new repurchase plan for up to $ 14,000 of common stock, replacing the previously authorized program. The program will expire when we have used all authorized funds or is otherwise terminated. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , there were 1,200,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. No preferred stock has been issued. Changes in Share Balances The following table shows changes in each class of shares: ##TABLE_START  Common Stock  Treasury Stock Balance at January 1, 2013 1,012,261,159  256,630,628 Issued   (17,903,704 ) Acquired   26,155,537 Balance at December 31, 2013 1,012,261,159  264,882,461 Issued   (6,719,270 ) Acquired   47,370,415 Balance at December 31, 2014 1,012,261,159  305,533,606 Issued   (7,288,113 ) Acquired   47,391,861 Balance at December 31, 2015 1,012,261,159  345,637,354 ##TABLE_ENDAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI) by component for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Currency Translation Adjustments  Unrealized Gains and Losses on Certain Investments  Unrealized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments  Defined Benefit Pension Plans  Other Postretirement Benefits  Total (1) Balance at January 1, 2013 $214  ($8 )  $86  ($17,708 )  ($17,416 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications (64 )   (75 )  6,093  5,954 Amounts reclassified from AOCI   (17 )  1,585 (2)  1,568 Net current period Other comprehensive loss (64 )   (92 )  7,678  7,522 Balance at December 31, 2013 $150  ($8 )  ($6 )  ($10,030 )  ($9,894 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications (97 )   (137 )  (4,644 )  (4,878 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI    (2)  Net current period Other comprehensive income/(loss) (97 )   (130 )  (3,782 )  (4,009 ) Balance at December 31, 2014 $53  ($8 )  ($136 )  ($13,812 )  ($13,903 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications (92 )  $8  (140 )   (51 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI    1,127 (2)  1,206 Net current period Other comprehensive income/(loss) (92 )   (61 )  1,300  1,155 Balance at December 31, 2015 ($39 )   ($197 )  ($12,512 )  ($12,748 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Net of tax. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Primarily relates to amortization of actuarial losses for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 totaling $1,038 , $661 , and $1,516 (net of tax of ($570) , ($367) , and ($849) ), respectively. These are included in the net periodic pension cost of which a portion is allocated to production as inventoried costs. See Note 14 . ##TABLE_END Note 17  Derivative Financial Instruments Cash Flow Hedges Our cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage currency risk associated with certain transactions, specifically forecasted sales and purchases made in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2021 . We use commodity derivatives, such as swaps and fixed-price purchase commitments to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. Our commodity contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2020 . Fair Value Hedges Interest rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt. The net change in fair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in Boeing Capital interest expense. Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment We have entered into agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives and international business requirements. These agreements are derivative instruments for accounting purposes. The quantities of aluminum in these agreements offset and are priced at prevailing market prices. We also hold certain foreign currency forward contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Notional Amounts and Fair Values The notional amounts and fair values of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Notional amounts (1) Other assets Accrued liabilities   2015  2015  Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:          Foreign exchange contracts $2,727  $2,586 $23  $9 ($304 )  ($204 ) Interest rate contracts  9     Commodity contracts  2  (13 )  (24 ) Derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment:          Foreign exchange contracts  4  (11 )  (5 ) Commodity contracts       Total derivatives $4,053  $3,064  (328 )  (233 ) Netting arrangements    (23 )  (16 )  Net recorded balance    $15  $25 ($305 ) ($217 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Notional amounts represent the gross contract/notional amount of the derivatives outstanding. ##TABLE_END Gains/(losses) associated with our cash flow and undesignated hedging transactions and their effect on Other comprehensive income/(loss) and Net earnings were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  Effective portion recognized in Other comprehensive income/(loss), net of taxes:    Foreign exchange contracts ($136 )  ($135 ) Commodity contracts (4 )  (2 ) Effective portion reclassified out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings, net of taxes:    Foreign exchange contracts (67 )  Commodity contracts (12 )  (13 ) Forward points recognized in Other income, net:    Foreign exchange contracts  Undesignated derivatives recognized in Other income, net:    Foreign exchange contracts (1 )  (7 ) ##TABLE_ENDBased on our portfolio of cash flow hedges, we expect to reclassify losses of $156 (pre-tax) out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings during the next 12 months. Ineffectiveness related to our hedges recognized in Other income was insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 . We have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. For foreign exchange contracts with original maturities of at least five years, our derivative counterparties could require settlement if we default on our five-year credit facility. For certain commodity contracts, our counterparties could require collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and commodity contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at December 31, 2015 was $51 . At December 31, 2015 , there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives. Note 18  Significant Group Concentrations of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments involving potential credit risk are predominantly with commercial aircraft customers and the U.S. government. Of the $12,393 in gross accounts receivable and gross customer financing included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2015 , $5,633 related predominantly to commercial aircraft customers ( $2,096 of accounts receivable and $3,537 of customer financing) and $4,864 related to the U.S. government. Of the $3,586 in gross customer financing, $2,487 related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit including Silk Way Airlines, AirBridgeCargo Airlines and American Airlines who were associated with 13% , 13% and 9% , respectively, of our financing portfolio. Financing for aircraft is collateralized by security in the related asset and in some instances security in other assets as well. Other Risk As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 38% of our total workforce was represented by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 13% of our total workforce was represented by agreements expiring in 2016. Note 19  Fair Value Measurements The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy. ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014  Total Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Assets       Money market funds $4,504 $4,504  $3,826 $3,826  Available-for-sale investments:       Commercial paper     Corporate notes     U.S. government agencies     Other 20  7  Derivatives  25  $25 Total assets $4,788 $4,524 $264 $3,858 $3,833 $25        Liabilities       Derivatives ($305 )  ($305 ) ($217 )  ($217 ) Total liabilities ($305 )  ($305 ) ($217 )  ($217 ) ##TABLE_ENDMoney market funds, available-for-sale debt investments and equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices or broker/dealer quotes of identical or comparable instruments. Derivatives include foreign currency, commodity and interest rate contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve. Certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following table presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended December 31 due to long-lived asset impairment, and the fair value and asset classification of the related assets as of the impairment date: ##TABLE_START    Fair Value  Total Losses  Fair Value  Total Losses Operating lease equipment $270  ($159 )  $187  ($170 ) Property, plant and equipment  (6 )   (15 ) Other assets and Acquired intangible assets    (17 ) Total $278  ($165 )  $206  ($202 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of the impaired operating lease equipment is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of third party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades and other market factors. Management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued appropriateness and consistency with market trends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected net sales price for the aircraft. Property, plant and equipment, Other assets and Acquired intangible assets were primarily valued using an income approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. For Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2015 , the following table presents the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques and related unobservable inputs of those assets. ##TABLE_START  Fair Value  Valuation Technique(s)  Unobservable Input  Range Median or Average Operating lease equipment $270  Market approach  Aircraft value publications  $226 - $394 (1) Median $343   Aircraft condition adjustments  ($112) - $39 (2) Net ($73) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  The range represents the sum of the highest and lowest values for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, according to the third party aircraft valuation publications that we use in our valuation process. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The negative amount represents the sum, for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, of all downward adjustments based on consideration of individual aircraft attributes and condition. The positive amount represents the sum of all such upward adjustments. ##TABLE_END Fair Value Disclosures The fair values and related carrying values of financial instruments that are not required to be remeasured at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2015  Carrying Amount  Total Fair Value  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets          Accounts receivable, net $8,713  $8,705    $8,705   Notes receivable, net       Liabilities          Debt, excluding capital lease obligations (9,814 )  (11,292 )    (11,123 )  ($169 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  December 31, 2014  Carrying Amount  Total Fair Value  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets          Accounts receivable, net $7,729  $7,845    $7,845   Notes receivable, net       Liabilities          Debt, excluding capital lease obligations (8,909 )  (10,686 )    (10,480 )  ($206 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of Accounts receivable is based on current market rates for loans of the same risk and maturities. The fair values of our variable rate notes receivable that reprice frequently approximate their carrying amounts. The fair values of fixed rate notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on current market yields. For our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowing cost derived from dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. The fair values of our debt classified as Level 3 are based on discounted cash flow models using the implied yield from similar securities. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain. Items not included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, Accounts payable and long-term payables. The carrying values of those items, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . The fair value of assets and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1). Note 20  Legal Proceedings Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are pending against us. Potentially material contingencies are discussed below. We are subject to various U.S. government inquiries and investigations, from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such government disputes and investigations will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made. Employment, Labor and Benefits Litigation In the second quarter of 2014, Boeing agreed to a $90 settlement with plaintiffs in the Harkness case with respect to litigation initiated by former Boeing employees in 2007 upon the sale of the Wichita facility to Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. (Spirit) in 2005. The settlement was approved by the district court in a fairness hearing in September 2015. The payment was made in the fourth quarter and the indemnification receivable from Spirit is included in Other Assets at December 31, 2015. On October 13, 2006, we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. Plaintiffs, seeking to represent a class of similarly situated participants and beneficiaries in The Boeing Company Voluntary Investment Plan (the VIP), alleged that fees and expenses incurred by the VIP were and are unreasonable and excessive, not incurred solely for the benefit of the VIP and its participants, and were undisclosed to participants. The plaintiffs further alleged that defendants breached their fiduciary duties in violation of 502(a)(2) of ERISA , and sought injunctive and equitable relief pursuant to 502(a)(3) of ERISA . The parties reached a provisional settlement on August 26, 2015, subject to a fairness hearing currently scheduled for March 2016. We do not expect this matter or the associated settlement to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Boeing Company Chicago, Illinois We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 . The financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 10, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP  Chicago, Illinois February 10, 2016  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Boeing Company Chicago, Illinois We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 of the Company and our report dated February 10, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP  Chicago, Illinois February 10, 2016  ", "9A": " Item 9A.

Aircraft modernization and sustainment includes major support performed as part of the C-17 Globemaster III Integrated Sustainment Program and aircraft programs for the Airborne Early Warning and Control ( AEWC ) and Airborne Warning and Control Systems ( AWACS ). Boeing Capital Segment BCC seeks to ensure that Boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing product and manages overall financing exposure. BCC s portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases, finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and investments. Financial and Other Business Information See the Summary of Business Segment Data and Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information, including revenues and earnings from operations, for each of our business segments. Intellectual Property We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. Non-U.S. Revenues See Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding non-U.S. revenues. Research and Development Research and development (RD) expenditures involve experimentation, design, development and related test activities for defense systems, new and derivative jet aircraft including both commercial and military, advanced space and other company-sponsored product development. RD expenditures are expensed as incurred including amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on U.S. government contracts. Our total research and development expense, net amounted to $4.6 billion , $3.3 billion and $3.0 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Research and development costs also include bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services, as well as costs incurred in excess of amounts estimated to be recoverable under cost-sharing research and development agreements. Bid and proposal costs were $311 million , $286 million and $289 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Employees Total workforce level at December 31, 2016 was approximately 150,500 . As of December 31, 2016 , our principal collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions: ##TABLE_START Union Percent of our Employees Represented Status of the Agreements with Major Union The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) 21% We have two major agreements; one expiring in June 2022 and one in September 2024. The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) 13% We have two major agreements expiring in Octo ber 2022. The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) 1% We have one major agreement expiring in October 2022. ##TABLE_ENDCompetition The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as Airbus, Embraer and Bombardier, and other entrants from Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with greater value products, services, and support. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which spans the life cycle of the airplane: aircraft acquisition, readying for service, maintenance and engineering, enhancing and upgrading, and transitioning to the next model - as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. BDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group, continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In addition, certain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2017 . Regulatory Matters Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our international markets. Government Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default. Commercial Aircraft. In the U.S., our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Internationally, similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Joint Aviation Authorities. Environmental. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations. A Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site for which we were originally assigned a partial share, the statutory framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. International. Our international sales are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and repatriation of earnings. International sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks. Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take a year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of companies. Suppliers We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and program/contract profitability, thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. We are also dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices. Seasonality No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report. Our Commercial Airplanes business depends heavily on commercial airlines, and is subject to unique risks. Market conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft. The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. In addition, availability of financing to non-U.S. customers depends in part on the continued operations of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally, or in the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period. We enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. In order to account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers. Our Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards. The commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S. suppliers, highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy regulatory and customer requirements, and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. We must minimize disruption caused by production changes and achieve productivity improvements in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have plans to adjust production rates on several of our commercial aircraft programs, while at the same time engaging in significant ongoing development and production of the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X aircraft. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements, and optimizing how we manage inventory. If production rate ramp-up efforts at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed, if other production rate changes result in significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer. Operational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins. Our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory certifications, could result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support costs. Further, if we cannot efficiently and cost-effectively incorporate design changes into early build 787 aircraft, we may face further profitability pressures on this program. If our commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly and technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues. Changes in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the U.S. DoD . Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such as the political environment, U.S. foreign policy, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as authorization and appropriations bills. In addition, significant budgetary delays and constraints have already resulted in reduced spending levels, and additional reductions may be forthcoming. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (The Act) established limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending between the 2012 and 2021 U.S. government fiscal years. Accordingly, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to pressure. In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies (including NASA) within the overall budgetary framework described above. While the House and Senate Appropriations committees included funding for Boeings major programs in FY2017, such as F/A-18, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, KC-46A Tanker and P-8 programs, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in FY2017 and beyond will affect Boeings programs. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorizations and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. In addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both U.S. defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment, we expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. If we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition priorities and/or fail to meet affordability targets set by the U.S. DoD customer, our revenues and market share would be further impacted. We conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks. In 2016 ,  23% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign military sales through the U.S. government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks. Our sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs. New procurement regulations, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our compliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS business. These requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could be subject to additional costs in the form of withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply with these requirements in the future. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as continuing resolutions rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position. We are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S. government contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, routinely audit government contractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false. We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns. Our BDS business generated approximately 71% of its 2016 revenues from fixed-price contracts. While fixed-price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. For example, during 2016, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $1,128 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract, primarily driven by additional costs attributable to design changes, testing and manufacturing complexity. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance. Fixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker , and commercial and military satellites. We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks. Our BDS business generated approximately 29% of its 2016 revenues from cost-type contracting arrangements. Some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Programs whose contracts are primarily cost-type include GMD , Proprietary and SLS programs. We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks. Contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit payments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite does not perform to specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance. The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees we ultimately expect to realize is recognized as revenue in the construction period. If the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criteria, customers will not be obligated to continue making in-orbit payments and/or we may be required to provide refunds to the customer and incur significant charges. Our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components. We rely on other companies including U.S. and non-U.S. subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies, and production commodities and to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers or incur additional costs. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum, titanium or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the suppliers control, such as geo-political developments, or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs. For example, we continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results. Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. With respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling and other non-recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes to price escalation indices, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer and supplier negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact these estimates. Any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under Managements Discussion and Analysis  Critical Accounting Policies  Contract Accounting/Program Accounting on pages 44  45 and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 55  66 of this Form 10-K. Competition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell may reduce our future contracts and sales. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasing competition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers and service providers in one or more of our market segments. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation, fewer large and new programs and new priorities, including near and long-term cost competitiveness, of our U.S. DoD and international customers will intensify competition for many of our products and services. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not result in reduced revenues and market share. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries. In 2016 , non-U.S. customers accounted for approximately 59% of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including: ##TABLE_START  changes in regulatory requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  domestic and international government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  fluctuations in international currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  volatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  imposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international tensions and conflicts. ##TABLE_END While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future. The outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. We are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the United States and its various states, as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S. government, the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our current or past ownership of certain property. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks. A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft, and among customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position could be materially adversely affected. We may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , our airplane financing commitments totaled $14,847 million and $16,283 million . If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures. As part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful. We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures. We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. We maintain insurance for certain risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. government. The amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft technologies, missile systems, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims or liabilities. Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses. Our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. Any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of our data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and of our products and services. Some of our and our suppliers workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages. Approximately 57,000 employees, which constitute 38% of our total workforce, were union represented as of December 31, 2016 . We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BMA program production. We may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 11 U.S. labor organizations and 7 non-U.S. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions requirements without impacting our financial condition. The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations. We have substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders ' equity and cash flows from operations and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods. The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and discretionary contributions to improve the plans ' funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions  could have a significant effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders ' equity. For U.S. government contracts, we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. We also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the level of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see  Management ' s Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies - Pension Plans  on pages 46  47 of this Form 10-K. Although GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement benefit contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or past manufacturing operations or the operations of companies we have acquired. In other cases, we may become subject to such costs due to an indemnification agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental liabilities. In addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation requirements could result in additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Unauthorized access to our or our customers information and systems could negatively impact our business. We face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address these threats. While these measures are designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems, certain types of attacks, including cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information and information technology systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we cannot prevent the unauthorized access, release and/or corruption of our customers confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or we could face financial losses.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in many countries and rely on an extensive network of international partners, key suppliers and subcontractors. Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses  Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space  Security ( BDS )  supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital ( BCC ). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands and we price our products and services to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. Commercial Airplanes is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits us as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets sometimes offset. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers. In November 2016, we announced plans for the formation of Boeing Global Services (BGS), which will bring together certain Commercial Aviation Services businesses currently included in the Commercial Airplanes segment and certain BDS businesses (primarily those currently included in the Global Services  Support (GSS) segment). We expect BGS to be operational during the second half of 2017. Consolidated Results of Operations  The following table summarizes key indicators of consolidated results of operations: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except per share data)      Years ended December 31,   Revenues $94,571  $96,114  $90,762       GAAP      Earnings from operations 5,834  7,443  7,473 Operating margins 6.2 %  7.7 %  8.2 % Effective income tax rate 12.1 %  27.7 %  23.7 % Net earnings $4,895  $5,176  $5,446 Diluted earnings per share $7.61  $7.44  $7.38       Non-GAAP (1)      Core operating earnings $5,464  $7,741  $8,860 Core operating margins 5.8 %  8.1 %  9.8 % Core earnings per share $7.24  $7.72  $8.60 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) These measures exclude certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense.

Commercial Airplanes revenues decreased by $979 million or 1% primarily due to lower deliveries. BDS revenues for 2016  decreased by $890 million compared with the same period in 2015 due to lower revenues in Boeing Military Aircraft ( BMA ) and Network  Space Systems ( NSS ), partially offset by higher revenues in GSS . Revenues in 2015 increased by $5,352 million or 6% compared with 2014. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $6,058 million or 10% due to higher new airplane deliveries and mix. BDS revenues decreased by $493 million or 2% primarily due to lower revenues in the GSS and NSS segments. The changes in unallocated items, eliminations and other in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 primarily reflect the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries. Earnings From Operations  The following table summarizes Earnings from operations: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Commercial Airplanes $3,130  $5,157  $6,411 Defense, Space  Security 3,008  3,274  3,133 Boeing Capital   Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit income/(expense)  (298 )  (1,387 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations (733 )  (740 )  (776 ) Earnings from operations (GAAP) $5,834  $7,443  $7,473 Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit (370 )   1,387 Core operating earnings (Non-GAAP) $5,464  $7,741  $8,860 ##TABLE_ENDEarnings from operations in 2016  decreased by $1,609 million compared with 2015 due to lower earnings at Commercial Airplanes, partially offset by the change in unallocated pension and postretirement income/(expense). Commercial Airplanes earnings in 2016 decreased by $2,027 million primarily due to the reclassification of $1,235 million of 787 flight test aircraft costs to research and development and higher reach-forward losses on the 747 and KC-46A Tanker programs. The reclassification of flight test aircraft costs was recorded in second quarter as a result of our determination that two 787 flight test aircraft were no longer commercially saleable. The change in the unallocated pension and postretirement income/(expense) in 2016 was primarily driven by lower service costs and lower amortization of actuarial losses. Earnings from operations in 2015 decreased by $30 million compared with 2014 primarily reflecting a fourth quarter charge of $885 million related to the 747 program at Commercial Airplanes and higher charges of $410 million related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker recorded by Commercial Airplanes and our BMA segment, partially offset by lower unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense of $1,089 million. The 2015 unallocated expense is lower than 2014, primarily due to the lower amortization of pension costs capitalized as inventory in prior years as well as lower settlements and curtailments. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker program. In 2016, we recorded charges of $1,128 million , of which $772 million was recorded at Commercial Airplanes and $356 million at our BMA segment. During 2015, we recorded charges of $835 million : $513 million at Commercial Airplanes and $322 million at our BMA segment. During 2014, we recorded charges of $425 million : $238 million at Commercial Airplanes and $187 million at our BMA segment. During 2016 and 2015 we recorded reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258 million and $885 million. Core operating earnings for 2016  decreased by $2,277 million compared with 2015 primarily due to the reclassification of costs related to the 787 flight test aircraft and higher charges on the 747 and KC-46A Tanker programs described above. Core operating earnings in 2015 decreased by $1,119 million compared with 2014 primarily due to the 2015 747 charge and higher KC-46A Tanker charges. Unallocated Items, Eliminations and Other The most significant items included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other are shown in the following table: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Share-based plans ($66 )  ($76 )  ($67 ) Deferred compensation (46 )  (63 )  (44 ) Eliminations and other (621 )  (601 )  (665 ) Sub-total (included in core operating earnings*) (733 )  (740 )  (776 ) Pension  (421 )  (1,469 ) Postretirement   Pension and other postretirement benefit income/(expense) (excluded from core operating earnings*)  (298 )  (1,387 ) Total unallocated items, eliminations and other ($363 )  ($1,038 )  ($2,163 ) ##TABLE_END* Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense. See pages 42 - 43 . Deferred compensation expense decreased by $17 million in 2016 and increased by $19 million in 2015, primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions and our stock price. Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $ 20 million in 2016 and decreased by $ 64 million in 2015 primarily due to the timing of the elimination of profit on intercompany aircraft deliveries and expense allocations. Net periodic benefit cost related to pension totaled $523 million , $2,786 million and $2,208 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The components of net periodic benefit cost are shown in the following table: ##TABLE_START  Pension Years ended December 31,   Service cost $604  $1,764  $1,661 Interest cost 3,050  2,990  3,058 Expected return on plan assets (3,999 )  (4,031 )  (4,169 ) Amortization of prior service costs   Recognized net actuarial loss  1,577  1,020 Settlement/curtailment/other losses   Net periodic benefit cost $523  $2,786  $2,208 ##TABLE_ENDThe decrease in net periodic pension benefit cost of $2,263 million in 2016 is primarily due to lower service costs and lower amortization of actuarial losses. The lower service costs reflect the changes to our retirement plans whereby certain employees transitioned in 2016 to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan. The lower amortization of actuarial losses reflects actuarial gains in 2015 resulting from the year-end discount rate increase from 3.9% to 4.2%. The increase in 2015 net periodic benefit cost related to pension is primarily due to $557 million of higher amortization of actuarial losses in 2015 resulting from the 2014 year-end discount rate decrease from 4.8% to 3.9%. A portion of net periodic benefit cost is recognized in Earnings from operations in the period incurred and the remainder is included in inventory at the end of the reporting period and recorded in Earnings from operations in subsequent periods. Costs are allocated to the business segments as described in Note 21 . Net periodic benefit costs included in Earnings from operations were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Pension Years ended December 31,   Allocated to business segments ($2,196 )  ($1,945 )  ($1,746 ) Unallocated items, eliminations and other  (421 )  (1,469 ) Total ($1,979 )  ($2,366 )  ($3,215 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe unallocated pension costs recognized in earnings in 2016 was a benefit of $217 million compared with expense of $421 million in 2015 . The 2016 benefit reflects the difference between the higher segment allocation compared to the U.S. GAAP net periodic pension costs recognized in earnings in the current period. Unallocated pension expense recognized in earnings decreased by $1,048 million in 2015 primarily due to lower amortization of pension costs capitalized as inventory in prior years and lower curtailment charges in 2015. Other Earnings Items ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Earnings from operations $5,834  $7,443  $7,473 Other income/(loss), net  (13 )  (3 ) Interest and debt expense (306 )  (275 )  (333 ) Earnings before income taxes 5,568  7,155  7,137 Income tax expense (673 )  (1,979 )  (1,691 ) Net earnings from continuing operations $4,895  $5,176  $5,446 ##TABLE_ENDInterest and debt expense increased by $31 million in 2016 as a result of higher average debt balances. Our effective income tax rates were 12.1% , 27.7% and 23.7% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our 2016 effective tax rate was lower than 2015 primarily due to tax benefits of $617 million recorded in the third quarter of 2016 related to tax basis adjustments and settlement of the 2011 - 2012 federal tax audits. Our 2015 effective tax rate was higher than 2014 primarily due to tax benefits of $524 million recorded in the second quarter of 2014 related to tax basis adjustments and settlement of the 2007-2010 federal tax audits. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Total Costs and Expenses (Cost of Sales) Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales and BDS predominantly uses contract accounting. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. Under contract accounting, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. The following table summarizes cost of sales: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,  Change   Change Cost of sales $80,790  $82,088 ($1,298 )  $82,088  $76,752 $5,336 Cost of sales as a % of revenues 85.4 %  85.4 % 0.0 %  85.4 %  84.6 % 0.8 % ##TABLE_ENDCost of sales in 2016  decreased by $1,298 million , or 2%, compared with 2015 , primarily due to lower volume across all segments, partially offset by the 747 reach-forward losses at Commercial Airplanes. Cost of sales in 2015 increased by $5,336 million, or 7%, compared with 2014, primarily driven by the $5,352 million, or 6%, increase in revenues. Cost of sales at Commercial Airplanes increased by $6,846 million, or 14%, primarily driven by the 10% increase in revenues. Cost of sales at BDS decreased by $252 million, or 1%, primarily due to the 2% reduction in revenues. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was approximately 85.4% in 2015 compared with 84.6% in 2014 primarily driven by the 2015 747 charge and higher KC-46A Tanker charges. Research and Development The following table summarizes our Research and development expense: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Commercial Airplanes $3,755  $2,340  $1,881 Defense, Space  Security   1,158 Other (47 )   Total $4,627  $3,331  $3,047 ##TABLE_ENDResearch and development expense in 2016  increased by $1,296 million compared with 2015 primarily due to the reclassification of $1,235 million of costs from inventory in the second quarter of 2016 related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft and higher spending on 777X at Commercial Airplanes. Research and development expense in 2015 increased by $284 million compared with 2014 primarily due to higher 777X spending at Commercial Airplanes which more than offset lower spending at BDS. Backlog Our backlog at December 31 was as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)   Contractual Backlog:      Commercial Airplanes $416,198  $431,408  $440,118 Defense, Space  Security:      Boeing Military Aircraft 21,415  19,947  21,078 Network  Space Systems 5,054  7,368  8,935 Global Services  Support 15,610  17,872  16,961 Total Defense, Space  Security 42,079  45,187  46,974 Total contractual backlog $458,277  $476,595  $487,092 Unobligated backlog $15,215  $12,704  $15,299 ##TABLE_ENDContractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The decrease in contractual backlog during 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to deliveries in excess of net orders. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The increase in unobligated backlog in 2016 was primarily due to contract awards, partially offset by reclassifications to contractual backlog related to BDS contracts. The decrease in unobligated backlog in 2015 was primarily due to reclassifications to contractual backlog related to incremental funding for BDS contracts, partially offset by contract awards. Additional Considerations KC-46A Tanker In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force ( USAF ) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. The EMD contract is currently in the certification and flight testing phases. In 2015, we began work on low rate initial production (LRIP) aircraft for the USAF. During the third quarter of 2016, following our achievement of key flight testing milestones, the USAF authorized two LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at $2.8 billion. On January 27, 2017, the USAF authorized an additional LRIP lot for 15 aircraft valued at $2.1 billion. Through 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,260 million related to the EMD contract and LRIP aircraft. During 2016 we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,128 million . In the first quarter of 2016, we recorded charges of $243 million which were primarily driven by higher than anticipated certification and test rework and the change incorporation impact to EMD and LRIP aircraft. In the second quarter of 2016, technical complexities and schedule delays resulted in charges of $573 million. The charges were driven by costs associated with certification delays and higher costs associated with the overall revised schedule, as well as a boom axial load issue that required a hardware solution, and production concurrency between late-stage development testing and the initial production aircraft. Charges of $312 million in the fourth quarter were primarily driven by greater than anticipated effort required to incorporate previously identified changes into LRIP aircraft currently in production, along with associated manufacturing and schedule disruptions. The need for this additional work was identified as aircraft were being prepared for certification and testing. As with any development program, this program remains subject to additional reach-forward losses if we experience further technical or quality issues, schedule delays or increased costs. The first tanker delivery is expected to occur in late 2017 with 18 fully operational aircraft to be delivered in early 2018. The contract contains production options for both LRIP aircraft and full rate production aircraft. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. Russia/Ukraine We continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. A number of our commercial customers also have operations in Russia and Ukraine. To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to production or deliveries. Should suppliers or customers experience disruption, our production and/or deliveries could be materially impacted. Export-Import Bank of the United States Many of our non-U.S. customers finance purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the banks charter on June 30, 2015, the banks charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the banks board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. Certain of our non-U.S. customers also may seek to delay purchases if they cannot obtain financing at reasonable costs, and there may be further impacts with respect to future sales campaigns involving non-U.S. customers. We continue to work with our customers to mitigate risks associated with the lack of a quorum of the banks board of directors and assist with alternative third party financing sources. Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment Passenger traffic growth is estimated at approximately 6% in 2016. While growth was strong across all major world regions, there continues to be significant variation between regions and airline business models. Airlines operating in the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions as well as low-cost-carriers globally are currently leading passenger growth. Air cargo traffic growth is estimated at approximately 3% in 2016. The sluggish air cargo market recovery has resulted in reduced orders and demand for new freighter aircraft and freighter conversions. Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also relentlessly focusing on reducing costs by renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airplanes and in 2016 benefited significantly from lower fuel costs. Net profits for the global airline industry are estimated to be approximately $36 billion in 2016. 2017 airline profits are expected to be slightly lower than 2016, at approximately $30 billion. The long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast projects a long-term average growth rate of 4.8% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. Based on long-term projections of 2.9% average annual GDP growth, we project a $5.9 trillion market for approximately 39,600 new airplanes over the next 20 years. However, we continue to monitor near-term market conditions in the wide-body segment. The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global environmental regulations. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Market liberalization in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is enabling low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 11% of Commercial Airplanes contractual backlog, in dollar terms, is with U.S. airlines, including cargo carriers. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and increasingly capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft in the market above 90 seats. Some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including launch aid, which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airplane development activities and enables airplanes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. Changes in value of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies impact competitors revenues and profits. Many competitors are expected to benefit from the strong U.S. dollar experienced in 2016 and ongoing improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share through pricing and/or improving earnings. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spare parts, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively.

Revenues increased by $6,058 million or 10% in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries and mix. Commercial Airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  *    Total           Cumulative deliveries 6,203  1,528  1,096  1,460   Deliveries (19)  (3)    748           Cumulative deliveries 5,713  1,519  1,083  1,361   Deliveries (15)  (3)    762           Cumulative deliveries 5,218  1,501  1,067  1,263   Deliveries (15)  (3)    723 ##TABLE_END* Intercompany deliveries identified by parentheses Earnings From Operations  Earnings from operations in 2016  decreased by $2,027 million compared with the same period in 2015 . The decrease in earnings and operating margins is primarily due to higher research and development costs of $1,415 million , delivery mix and higher reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258 million compared with $885 million in 2015 . Research and development expense in 2016 reflect the reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of $1,235 million related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft and higher planned spending related to the 777X program. Earnings include reach-forward losses related to the KC-46A Tanker of $772 million recorded in 2016 compared with $513 million in 2015. Earnings from operations in 2015 decreased by $1,254 million or 20% compared with 2014 primarily due to higher reach-forward losses of $1,160 million and higher research and development spending of $459 million, largely on the 777X, which more than offset higher new airplane deliveries and mix. During the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a charge of $885 million to recognize a reach-forward loss on the 747 program. In addition, we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker contract of $513 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $238 million in the second quarter of 2014. Operating margins in 2015 decreased primarily due to additional reach-forward losses, higher research and development expense and the dilutive impact of 787 volume and mix. Backlog  Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their board of directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers. The decrease in backlog during 2016 and 2015 was due to deliveries in excess of net orders. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a programs life. Estimation of each programs accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. ##TABLE_START  Program   747*    777X  2016            Program accounting quantities 9,000  1,555  1,159  1,625  **  1,300 Undelivered units under firm orders 4,452      Cumulative firm orders 10,655  1,556  1,189  1,596   1,200            Program accounting quantities 8,400  1,574  1,147  1,650  **  1,300 Undelivered units under firm orders 4,392      Cumulative firm orders 10,105  1,539  1,163  1,579   1,142            Program accounting quantities 7,800  1,574  1,113  1,600  **  1,300 Undelivered units under firm orders 4,299      Cumulative firm orders 9,517  1,537  1,114  1,541   1,071 ##TABLE_END* At December 31, 2016 , the 747 accounting quantity has 26 undelivered aircraft, including 9 that have not been sold or may be remarketed. ** The accounting quantity for the 777X will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020. Program Highlights 737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 600 units during 2016 due to the program  s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 42 per month and plan to increase to 47 per month in 2017. We plan to further increase the rate to 52 per month in 2018 and to 57 per month in 2019. First delivery of the 737 MAX is expected in 2017. 747 Program During the fourth quarter of 2016 we received an order for 14 new aircraft. We are currently producing at rate of 0.5 aircraft per month having reduced the rate from 1.0 per month in September 2016. Lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower-than-expected growth of global freight traffic have continued to drive market uncertainties, pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated. As a result, during 2016, we canceled previous plans to return to a production rate of 1.0 aircraft per month beginning in 2019, resulting in a reduction in the program accounting quantity from 1,574 to 1,555 aircraft. This reduction in the program accounting quantity, together with lower anticipated revenues from future sales and higher costs associated with producing fewer airplanes, resulted in a reach-forward loss of $1,188 million in the second quarter of 2016. We previously recognized reach-forward losses of $885 million in 2015 and $70 million during the first quarter of 2016 related to our prior decision to reduce the production rate to 0.5 per month and anticipating lower estimated revenue from future sales due to ongoing pricing and market pressures. We continue to have a number of completed aircraft in inventory as well as unsold production positions and we remain focused on obtaining additional orders and implementing cost-reduction efforts. If we are unable to obtain sufficient orders and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, we could record additional losses that may be material, and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747. 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 12 units during 2016 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. We increased the combined tanker and commercial production rate from 1.5 per month to 2 per month in April 2016. We plan to further increase the rate to 2.5 per month in the fourth quarter of 2017. 777 Program We produced at a rate of 8.3 per month during 2016. We implemented a planned production rate decrease to 7 per month at the beginning of 2017. In addition, we announced in December 2016 that, due to lower than anticipated 777 orders, we plan to further reduce the rate to 5 per month in the second half of 2017. We reduced the program accounting quantity from 1,650 to 1,625 aircraft, reflecting recent order activity and planned production rates. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we launched the 777X, which features a new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips. The 777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020. 787 Program During 2016, the program received 58 net new orders and increased the production rate from 10 per month to a rate of 12 per month. We are planning a further rate increase to 14 per month by the end of the decade. First delivery of the 787-10 derivative aircraft is targeted for 2018. The accounting quantity of 1,300 units remains unchanged. We remain focused on improving productivity and obtaining additional orders to support planned production. We continue to monitor and address challenges associated with aircraft production and assembly, including management of our manufacturing operations and extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work, as well as completing and delivering early build aircraft. During 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs associated with those airplanes were included in research and development expense. We produced the fourth and fifth flight test aircraft in 2009 but have been unable to sell them at acceptable prices. The aircraft have been used extensively for flight and ground testing and we intended to begin to refurbish the aircraft in early 2017 for commercial sale based on sales activity and market interest. However, during the second quarter of 2016 we determined that firm orders for these aircraft prior to refurbishment were now unlikely, and that the Company would not invest company funds for their refurbishment. The Company also determined the costs to refurbish the aircraft at a future date would be prohibitively expensive. We therefore determined that the aircraft were not commercially saleable, and accordingly, costs of $1,235 million associated with these aircraft were reclassified from 787 program inventory to research and development expense during the second quarter of 2016. We have firm orders for the five remaining undelivered early build aircraft and plan to complete retrofitting them by the end of 2017 . The combination of production challenges, change incorporation on early build aircraft, schedule delays, customer and supplier impacts and changes to price escalation factors has created significant pressure on program profitability and we continue to have near breakeven gross margins. We are continuing to monitor wide-body demand and if sufficient orders do not materialize during the next several quarters we may consider appropriate adjustments to the planned production rate increase. If risks related to these challenges, together with risks associated with the planned production rate and productivity improvements, supply chain management or introducing or manufacturing the 787-10 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face further pressures on program profitability and/or a reach-forward loss. We continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks. Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. Program Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. ##TABLE_START Go-ahead and Initial Delivery                  737 MAX                      787-10                      777X                      ##TABLE_ENDReflects models in development during 2016 We launched the 787-10 in June 2013 and the 777X in November 2013. Additional Considerations The development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Defense, Space  Security Business Environment and Trends United States Government Defense Environment Overview  The new U.S. administration and key members of the 115th Congress have expressed a general desire to reverse the effects of the budgetary reductions of the past several years. However, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (The Act), which mandated limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, remains in effect through the 2021 government fiscal year causing budget uncertainty and continued risk of future sequestration cuts. In addition, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) and other government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. Funding timeliness also remains a risk as the federal government is currently operating under a continuing resolution that expires on April 28, 2017. If Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills before the continuing resolution expires, a government shutdown could result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts or program-level appropriations. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. DoD or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders.  International Environment Overview The international market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of international opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given the diverse regional threats.

In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Deliveries of units for new-build production aircraft, including remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   F/A-18 Models   F-15 Models   C-17 Globemaster III   CH-47 Chinook (New)   CH-47 Chinook (Renewed)   AH-64 Apache (New)   AH-64 Apache (Remanufactured)   P-8 Models   AEWC   C-40A 1  Total   ##TABLE_ENDRevenues  BDS revenues in 2016  decreased by $890 million compared with the same period in 2015 due to lower revenues of $909 million and $705 million in the BMA and NSS segments, partially offset by higher revenues of $724 million in the GSS segment. BDS revenues in 2015 decreased by $493 million compared with 2014 primarily due to lower revenues in the GSS and NSS segments. Earnings From Operations  BDS earnings from operations in 2016  decreased by $266 million compared with the same period in 2015 due to lower earnings of $233 million and $80 million in the NSS and BMA segments, partially offset by higher earnings of $47 million in the GSS segment. Included above are net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $429 million higher in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily reflecting the absence of favorable F-15 program adjustments recorded in 2015 and the charge of $162 million on the Commercial Crew program recorded at NSS during 2016. BDS earnings from operations in 2015 increased by $141 million compared with 2014 due to higher earnings in all three segments. Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $49 million lower in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily reflecting higher charges of $135 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract recorded at BMA which more than offset higher favorable adjustments in the GSS segment. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, BDS earnings from operations include reach-forward losses of $356 million, $322 million and $187 million on the KC-46A Tanker program. Backlog Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. BDS total backlog was $57,134 million at December 31, 2016 , reflecting a decrease of 1% from December 31, 2015 . BDS total backlog was $57,675 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting a decrease of 7% from December 31, 2014. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional Considerations Our BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense ( GMD ), Proprietary and Space Launch System ( SLS ) programs. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew and commercial and military satellites.

BMA revenues in 2015 increased by $14 million compared with 2014 primarily due to higher revenues of $1,131 million from a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2015 on the F-15 program due to completion of contract negotiations, higher milestone revenue on the USAF KC-46A Tanker program, and higher deliveries and mix on the CH-47 Chinook program. The increase was partially offset by fewer deliveries and mix on the F/A-18, Apache and V-22 programs. Earnings From Operations  BMA earnings from operations in 2016  decreased by $80 million compared with 2015 primarily due to lower volume and mix on the CH-47 Chinook, and C-17, partially offset by higher volume and mix on the Apache and P-8 programs. BMA recorded charges of $356 million in 2016 compared with $322 million in 2015 related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract. Net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $253 million higher in 2016 than in 2015 primarily driven by the absence of favorable F-15 program adjustments recorded in 2015 and higher USAF KC-46A Tanker charges recorded in 2016. BMA earnings from operations in 2015 increased by $17 million compared with 2014 primarily due to C-17 charges in 2014, higher CH-47 Chinook deliveries in 2015 and higher earnings on the F-15 program, primarily due to a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2015. These increases were partially offset by higher charges of $135 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract and lower earnings on proprietary programs. BMA recorded charges of $322 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $187 million in the second quarter of 2014 related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract. In addition, BMA recorded a charge of $48 million in the first quarter of 2014 to write-off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of our decision to produce three fewer C-17 aircraft in 2015 than previously planned. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $96 million lower in 2015 than in 2014 primarily driven by the USAF KC-46A Tanker charges and lower favorable F/A-18 adjustments, partially offset by higher favorable F-15 program adjustments. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, BMA earnings from operations include reach-forward losses of $356 million, $322 million and $187 million on the KC-46A Tanker program. Backlog BMA total backlog of $25,441 million at December 31, 2016  decrease d by 6% from December 31, 2015 , reflecting revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by current year contract awards for the P-8, Apache, CH-47 Chinook, and weapons programs. BMA total backlog at December 31, 2015 was $27,088 million, a decrease of 7% reflecting revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by contract awards for the F-15, Apache, C-17 and F/A-18 programs.

These decreases were partially offset by higher volume on the SLS program. NSS revenues in 2015 decreased by $252 million compared with 2014 primarily due to lower revenue of $1,061 million, primarily on satellite and proprietary programs and volume and mix of sales to our United Launch Alliance ( ULA ) joint venture, partially offset by higher volume on the Commercial Crew program. New-build satellite deliveries were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Commercial and civil satellites   Military satellites   ##TABLE_ENDEarnings From Operations  NSS earnings from operations in 2016  decreased by $233 million compared with 2015 primarily due to a charge of $162 million during the third quarter of 2016 and lower volume on the Commercial Crew program. Net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $186 million higher in 2016 than 2015 primarily reflecting the charge on the Commercial Crew program during 2016. These decreases were partially offset by higher equity earnings. NSS earnings from operations in 2015 increased by $28 million compared with 2014 primarily due to higher earnings of $83 million from improved performance on several Electronic and Information Solutions ( EIS ) programs partially offset by lower performance on a development program. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $10 million lower in 2015 than in 2014 primarily due to higher unfavorable adjustments on commercial satellite programs. NSS earnings from operations include equity earnings of $255 million , $183 million and $211 million primarily from our ULA joint venture in 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Backlog NSS total backlog of $13,347 million at December 31, 2016  increase d by 8% compared to December 31, 2015 . The increase was due to adjustments recorded in 2016 related to backlog in prior years. Current year contract awards for missile defense, SLS, and government satellite programs were more than offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years. NSS total backlog was $12,347 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting a decrease of 17% from December 31, 2014 primarily due to revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by current year contract awards including orders from NASA for International Space Station engineering support and Post Certification Mission 1 on the Commercial Crew program.

GSS revenues in 2015 decreased by $255 million compared with 2014 primarily due to final Airborne Early Warning and Control ( AEWC ) deliveries and lower volume in several TSGS programs, partially offset by higher volume on several IL programs. Earnings From Operations  GSS earnings from operations in 2016  increased by $47 million compared with the same period in 2015 primarily due to higher volume and mix across the segment partially offset by lower performance. The impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments was not significant in 2016. GSS earnings from operations in 2015 increased by $96 million compared with 2014 primarily due to improved performance across the segment. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $57 million higher in 2015 than in 2014 primarily due to favorable F-15 program adjustments.  Backlog GSS total backlog has remained consistent at $18,346 million , $18,240 million and $17,951 million at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Boeing Capital Business Environment and Trends BCCs gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2016 totaled $4,115 million . A substantial portion of BCCs portfolio is related to customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BCCs portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft. BCC provided customer financing of $1,376 million and $586 million during 2016 and 2015 . While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2017 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources. However, a number of factors could cause BCCs new business volume to increase further, including if the Export-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not, approve new financing transactions. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,200 western-built commercial jet aircraft ( 8.8% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2016 , including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 7% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2015 and 2014 , 9.5% and 9.8% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. Results of Operations ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Revenues $298  $413  $416 Earnings from operations $59  $50  $92 Operating margins %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDRevenues  BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and notes, and other income. BCC s revenues in 2016 decreased by $115 million compared with 2015 primarily due to lower lease income, and lower end of lease settlement payments. BCC s revenues in 2015 were consistent with 2014. Earnings From Operations  BCCs earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2016 increased by $9 million primarily due to lower asset impairment expense which more than offset lower revenues. Earnings from operations in 2015 decreased by $42 million compared with 2014 primarily due to higher asset impairment expense. Financial Position The following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Customer financing and investment portfolio, net $4,109  $3,449 Other assets, primarily cash and short-term investments  Total assets $4,455  $3,929     Other liabilities, primarily deferred income taxes $1,007  $1,099 Debt, including intercompany loans 2,864  2,355 Equity  Total liabilities and equity $4,455  $3,929     Debt-to-equity ratio 4.9-to-1  5.0-to-1 ##TABLE_ENDBCC s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2016  increased from December 31, 2015 , primarily due to new volume of $1,376 million partially offset by note payoffs, asset sales and portfolio run-off. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , BCC had $6 million and $49 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $46 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2017 . We are seeking to remarket these aircraft or have the leases extended. BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Summary ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Net earnings $4,895  $5,176  $5,446 Non-cash items 2,559  2,392  2,515 Changes in working capital 3,045  1,795  Net cash provided by operating activities 10,499  9,363  8,858 Net cash (used)/provided by investing activities (3,380 )  (1,846 )  2,467 Net cash used by financing activities (9,587 )  (7,920 )  (8,593 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (33 )  (28 )  (87 ) Net (decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents (2,501 )  (431 )  2,645 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 11,302  11,733  9,088 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $8,801  $11,302  $11,733 ##TABLE_ENDOperating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $10.5 billion during 2016 , compared with $9.4 billion during 2015 and $8.9 billion in 2014 . The increase of $1.1 billion in 2016 was primarily due to lower expenditures on commercial airplane program inventory, primarily 787. The increase of $0.5 billion in 2015 was primarily due to lower inventory growth, partially offset by lower receipts of advances and progress billings. Advances and progress billings decreased by $1.9 billion in 2016 and increased by $0.4 billion in 2015 and $6.9 billion in 2014 . Discretionary contributions to our pension plans were $0.1 billion in 2016 and insignificant in 2015 compared with $0.8 billion in 2014 . Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities during 2016 and 2015 was $3.4 billion and $1.8 billion , largely due to capital expenditures. Cash provided by investing activities during 2014 was $2.5 billion , largely due to changes in investments in time deposits. Net contributions to investments were $0.5 billion in 2016 compared with net proceeds from investments of $0.6 billion in 2015 and $4.8 billion in 2014 . Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, during 2016 was $0.3 billion compared with an insignificant amount in 2015 and $0.2 billion in 2014 . In 2016 , capital expenditures totaled $2.6 billion , up from $2.5 billion in 2015 and $2.2 billion in 2014 . We expect capital expenditures in 2017 to be lower than 2016 . Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $9.6 billion during 2016 , an increase of $1.7 billion compared with 2015 primarily due to net borrowings in 2015 as well as higher share repurchases and dividend payments in 2016. Cash used by financing activities was $7.9 billion during 2015, a decrease of $0.7 billion compared with 2014 primarily due to higher new borrowings in 2015 of $0.8 billion and lower repayments of debt and distribution rights of $0.9 billion in 2015, which more than offset higher share repurchases of $0.8 billion and higher dividend payments of $0.4 billion. During 2016 , we issued $1.3 billion and repaid $1.4 billion of debt. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 the recorded balance of debt was $10.0 billion and $10.0 billion of which $0.4 billion and $1.2 billion was classified as short-term. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 this included $2.9 billion and $2.4 billion of debt attributable to BCC , of which $0.1 billion and $0.5 billion were classified as short-term. During 2016 and 2015 we repurchased 55.1 million and 46.7 million shares totaling $7.0 billion and $6.8 billion through our open market share repurchase program. In 2016 and 2015 , we had 0.7 million shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At December 31, 2016 , the amount available under the share repurchase plan, announced on December 12, 2016, totaled $14 billion . Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that continues to serve as a significant potential source of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2016 and at December 31, 2016 , we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $5.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. Financing commitments totaled $14.8 billion and $16.3 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In addition, many of our non-U.S. customers finance aircraft purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the banks charter on June 30, 2015, the banks charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the banks board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , our pension plans were $20.1 billion and $17.9 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2016 with minimal required contributions in 2017 . We expect to make contributions to our plans of approximately $0.5 billion in 2017 . We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years. At December 31, 2016 , we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2016 , and the estimated timing thereof. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Total  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  3-5 years  After 5 years Long-term debt (including current portion) $9,945  $327  $1,911  $1,840  $5,867 Interest on debt (1) 5,656     3,634 Pension and other postretirement cash requirements 15,476   3,412  3,969  7,316 Capital lease obligations     Operating lease obligations 1,494     Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position 107,564  38,458  31,381  20,478  17,247 Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position 17,415  16,652    Total contractual obligations (2) $157,694  $56,974  $38,786  $27,229  $34,705 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2016 . Variable rate debt was 3% of our total debt at December 31, 2016 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Excludes income tax matters. As of December 31, 2016 , our net liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions of $1,557 million , was $1,169 million . For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. ##TABLE_END Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation. Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2016 , we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2016 , we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $18.1 billion that extend through 2029 . Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2016 . ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Total Amounts Committed/Maximum Amount of Loss  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  4-5 years  After 5 years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $4,701  $3,051  $805  $3  $842 Commercial aircraft financing commitments 14,847  2,432  6,874  3,493  2,048 Total commercial commitments $19,548  $5,483  $7,679  $3,496  $2,890 ##TABLE_ENDCommercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect to delivered aircraft, based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required, particularly if the Export-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not, provide new financing support. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contingent Obligations We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $562 million at December 31, 2016 . For additional information, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-GAAP Measures Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the impact of certain pension and other postretirement benefit expenses that are not allocated to business segments. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to Commercial Airplanes. Pension costs allocated to BDS segments are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. The unallocated pension costs recognized in earnings during 2016 was a benefit of $217 million compared with an expense of $421 million and $1,469 million in 2015 and 2014 . The 2016 benefit reflects the difference between the higher segment allocation compared to the U.S. GAAP net periodic pension costs recognized in earnings in the current period, as well as lower settlements and curtailments. The 2015 unallocated expense is lower than 2014, primarily due to the lower amortization of pension costs capitalized as inventory in prior years as well as lower settlements and curtailments. For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see the Managements Discussion and Analysis on pages 21 and 22 of this Form 10-K and see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts. Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures The table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of earnings from operations, operating margins and diluted earnings per share. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except per share data)    Years ended December 31,   Revenues $94,571  $96,114  $90,762 Earnings from operations, as reported $5,834  $7,443  $7,473 Operating margins 6.2 %  7.7 %  8.2 %       Unallocated pension (income)/expense ($217 )  $421  $1,469 Unallocated other postretirement benefit income ($153 )  ($123 )  ($82 ) Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit (income)/expense ($370 )  $298  $1,387 Core operating earnings (non-GAAP) $5,464  $7,741  $8,860 Core operating margins (non-GAAP) 5.8 %  8.1 %  9.8 %       Diluted earnings per share, as reported $7.61  $7.44  $7.38 Unallocated pension (income)/expense ($0.33 )  $0.61  $1.99 Unallocated other postretirement benefit income ($0.24 )  ($0.18 )  ($0.11 ) Provision for deferred income taxes on adjustments (1) $0.20  ($0.15 )  ($0.66 ) Core earnings per share (non-GAAP) $7.24  $7.72  $8.60       Weighted average diluted shares (in millions) 643.8  696.1  738.0 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The income tax impact is calculated using the tax rate in effect for the non-GAAP adjustments. ##TABLE_ENDCritical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting Contract accounting is used to determine revenue, cost of sales, and profit predominantly by our BDS business. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contracts inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts decreased Earnings from operations by $912 million and $224 million . For the year ended December 31, 2014 net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts increased Earnings from operations by $100 million . Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS for all of 2016 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $295 million . In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 and 777X programs, typically have lower initial margins than established programs. In addition, actual costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity are included within program inventory as deferred production costs. Deferred production, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements are realized. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins. If the combined gross margin percentages for our commercial airplane programs had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would have a similar effect on the Commercial Airplane segments operating margins. For the year ended December 31, 2016 , a 1% increase or decrease in operating margins for our Commercial Airplane segment would have a $650 million impact on operating earnings. The 747 program was in a reach-forward loss position at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Deliveries of 747s in 2016 were recorded at a zero margin and absent changes in estimated revenues or costs, future 747 deliveries will be recorded at zero margin. Reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately as an additional reach-forward loss. It is reasonably possible that we could make a decision to terminate the 747 program, which may result in additional reach-forward losses which may be material. The 787 program had near breakeven margins during 2016. If we are unable to mitigate risks associated with the 747 and 787 programs, or if our assumptions with respect to items such as pricing, cost or future production rates were to change, we could be required to record reach-forward losses which could have a material effect on our reported results. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any. We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2016 and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2016 , we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had $490 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets. Pension Plans The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders equity. The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2016 . ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Change in discount rate Increase 25 bps  Change in discount rate Decrease 25 bps Pension plans    Projected benefit obligation ($2,218 )  $2,793 Net periodic pension cost (89 )  ##TABLE_ENDPension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2016 net periodic pension expense by $147 million . We expect 2017 net periodic pension cost to decrease by approximately $214 million and the portion recognized in earnings to decrease by approximately $1,315 million primarily due to lower service cost and amortization of actuarial losses. Other Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Act), require disclosure of certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran that occurred during the period covered by this report. Disclosure is required even if the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. We have disclosed such activities in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2016 and such disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. ", "7A": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2016 , the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2016 , a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $226 million . Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. ", "8": " Item 8.

The Boeing Company and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014  (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as Boeing, the Company, we, us, or our). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The standard requires excess tax benefits or deficiencies for share-based payments to be recorded in the period shares vest or settle as income tax expense or benefit, rather than within Additional paid-in capital. Cash flows related to excess tax benefits will be included in Net cash provided by operating activities and will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity. The standard also allows us to repurchase more of an employees shares for tax withholding purposes and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. We have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures and are not planning to change tax withholdings. The Company prospectively adopted the standard during the second quarter of 2016 effective January 1, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, this resulted in an increase of $105 to Net earnings and $0.16 to diluted earnings per share. Adoption also resulted in a $105 increase in Net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding $105 reduction in Net cash used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016. Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016 - 02, Leases  (Topic 842) . The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The standard will require lessees to report most leases as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, while lessor accounting will remain substantially unchanged. The standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for existing leases, whereby the new rules will be applied to the earliest year presented. We do not expect the new lease standard to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We plan to implement ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers in the first quarter of 2018. This comprehensive new standard will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance and require revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also requires expanded disclosures regarding revenue and contracts with customers. The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards. The Company plans to adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018 and apply it retrospectively to all periods presented. We are analyzing the impact of the new standard on the Companys revenue contracts, comparing our current accounting policies and practices to the requirements of the new standard, and identifying potential differences that would result from applying the new standard to our contracts. We are also identifying and implementing changes to the Companys business processes, systems and controls to support adoption of the new standard in 2018 and recasting prior periods financial information. We expect adoption of the new standard will have a material impact on our income statement and balance sheet but are unable to quantify those impacts at this time. We currently expect that most of our BDS contracts that currently recognize revenue as deliveries are made or based on the attainment of performance milestones will recognize revenue under the new standard as costs are incurred. Certain military derivative aircraft contracts in our Commercial Airplane business will also recognize revenue as costs are incurred. The new standard will not change the total amount of revenue recognized on these contracts, only accelerate the timing of when the revenue is recognized. We expect a corresponding acceleration in timing of cost of sales recognition for these contracts resulting in a decrease in Inventories from long-term contracts in progress upon adoption of the new standard. We do not expect the new standard to affect revenue recognition or the use of program accounting for commercial airplane contracts in our Commercial Airplane business. We will continue to recognize revenue for these contracts at the point in time when the customer accepts delivery of the airplane. From a balance sheet perspective we expect adoption of the new standard will increase Total Assets and Total Liabilities because netting of advances from customers against inventory will no longer be permitted. This will result in an increase in the Advances liability and Inventories from commercial aircraft programs upon adoption of the new standard. Use of Estimates Management makes assumptions and estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Those assumptions and estimates directly affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant estimates for which changes in the near term are considered reasonably possible and that may have a material impact on the financial statements are disclosed in these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Cycle For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year . Revenue and Related Cost Recognition Contract Accounting Contract accounting is used for development and production activities predominantly by Defense, Space  Security ( BDS ). The majority of business conducted by BDS is performed under contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that extend over several years. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales and costs for each contract resulting in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. When the current estimates of total sales and costs for a contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contracts percent complete. In 2016 and 2015 , net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts decreased Earnings from operations by $912 and $224 and diluted EPS by $1.25 and $0.23 . In 2014 net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts increased Earnings from operations by $100 and diluted EPS by $0.10 . Significant adjustments during the three years ended December 31, 2016 included reach-forward losses of $1,128 , $835 and $425 on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract recorded during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . We combine contracts for accounting purposes when they are negotiated as a package with an overall profit margin objective. These essentially represent an agreement to do a single project for a single customer, involve interrelated construction activities with substantial common costs, and are performed concurrently or sequentially. When a group of contracts is combined, revenue and profit are earned uniformly over the performance of the combined contracts. Similarly, we may segment a single contract or group of contracts when a clear economic decision has been made during contract negotiations that would produce different rates of profitability for each element or phase of the contract. Sales related to fixed-price contracts are recognized as deliveries are made, except for certain fixed-price contracts that require substantial performance over an extended period before deliveries begin, for which sales are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones. Sales related to contracts in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if specified targets are achieved. Incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated and are probable are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded. Program Accounting Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales related to its programs. Program accounting is applicable to products manufactured for delivery under production-type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contracts and years. Under program accounting, inventoriable production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced, and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. We recognize sales for commercial airplane deliveries as each unit is completed and accepted by the customer. Sales recognized represent the price negotiated with the customer, adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. The amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effects on program margins are recognized prospectively except in cases where the program is determined to have a reach-forward loss in which case the loss is recognized in the current period. See Note 11 . Concession Sharing Arrangements We account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their purchase of products and services as a reduction to revenue when the related products and services are delivered. The sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendors products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products. Spare Parts Revenue We recognize sales of spare parts upon delivery and the amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost. Service Revenue Service revenue is recognized when the service is performed with the exception of U.S. government service agreements, which are accounted for using contract accounting. Service activities primarily include: support agreements associated with military aircraft and helicopter contracts, space travel on Commercial Crew, ongoing maintenance of International Space Station, and technical and flight operation services for commercial aircraft. Service revenue and associated cost of sales from pay-in-advance subscription fees are deferred and recognized as services are rendered. Financial Services Revenue We record financial services revenue associated with sales-type/finance leases, operating leases, and notes receivable. Lease and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type/finance leases, we record an asset at lease inception. This asset is recorded at the aggregate future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur. For operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets, included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated residual value, using the straight-line method. We periodically review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense. For notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note. Reinsurance Revenue Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Astro Ltd., participates in a reinsurance pool for workers compensation. The member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $147 , $136 and $135 during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were $139 , $132 and $144 during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Revenues and costs are presented net in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fleet Support We provide assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation to the operators of all our commercial airplane models. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, and technical consulting support. This activity continues throughout the aircrafts operational life. Services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire models fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services. Research and Development Research and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design, and testing, as well as bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers. Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with our contract accounting policy. We have certain research and development arrangements that meet the requirement for best efforts research and development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expense rather than as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of $311 , $286 and $289 in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. We have established cost sharing arrangements with some suppliers for the 787 program. Our cost sharing arrangements state that the supplier contributions are for reimbursements of costs we incur for experimentation, basic design, and testing activities during the 787 development. In each arrangement, we retain substantial rights to the 787 part or component covered by the arrangement. The amounts received from these cost sharing arrangements are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses since we have no obligation to refund any amounts received per the arrangements regardless of the outcome of the development efforts. Specifically, under the terms of each agreement, payments received from suppliers for their share of the costs are typically based on milestones and are recognized as earned when we achieve the milestone events and no ongoing obligation on our part exists. In the event we receive a milestone payment prior to the completion of the milestone, the amount is classified in Accrued liabilities until earned. Share-Based Compensation We provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value net of estimated forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. Income Taxes Provisions for federal, state, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Earnings before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. Tax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of Income tax expense. Postretirement Plans The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. We also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employees annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). A portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and reflected in inventory at the end of a reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in Shareholders equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities we amortize them over the average future service period of employees. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Postemployment Plans We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated. Environmental Remediation We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations, and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup, and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be able to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable were $77 and $163 at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Inventories Inventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe benefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries and plant services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costs include amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one year. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering. Commercial aircraft programs inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production costs represent actual costs incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costs are experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor and other resources) than units produced later in a program because of volume efficiencies and the effects of learning. We expect that these deferred costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive from suppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier advances are amortized to work in process. The determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision is recorded. The determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimate revenue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity. When estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. Used aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value. See Aircraft Valuation within this Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or net realizable value. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired inventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs. Included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the ability to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwise recoverable, it would be written off in the current period. We net advances and progress billings on long-term contracts against inventory in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Advances and progress billings in excess of related inventory are reported in Advances and billings in excess of related costs. Precontract Costs We may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recovery from future orders, then we capitalize the precontract costs we incur, excluding start-up costs which are expensed as incurred. Capitalized precontract costs are included in Inventories, net of advances and progress billings, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Should future orders not materialize or we determine the costs are no longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and equipment, from 4 to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over 5 years. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition. Long-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Long-lived assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Asset Retirement Obligations We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material. We also have known conditional asset retirement obligations, such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liabilitys fair value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g., asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1. We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology, from 4 to 14 years; product know-how, from 3 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 17 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 27 years; and other, from 2 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Investments Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost. Available-for-sale securities include commercial paper, U.S. treasury and U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized based on the specific identification method. Available-for-sale securities are assessed for impairment quarterly. The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between 20% and 50% . We classify investment income and loss on our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on whether the investment is operating or non-operating in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, including our share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from certain cost method investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic purposes. Earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on marketable securities, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in Other income/(expense), net. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them. We use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes in fair value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is to include in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For our cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss of a cash flow hedge is reported in earnings immediately. We have agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives and international business requirements. These agreements are derivatives for accounting purposes but are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We also hold certain derivative instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For these aluminum agreements and for other derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings immediately. Aircraft Valuation Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments. Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of: ##TABLE_START (1) adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recognized upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) charges to cost of products for adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in Accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_END The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customers requirements; or the scrap market. Trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market or using current published third-party aircraft valuations based on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individual attributes and known conditions. Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer financing. Customer financing Customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/finance leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary. We assess the fair value of the assets we own, including equipment under operating leases, assets held for sale or re-lease, and collateral underlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are less than the related assets carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fair values of sales-type/finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables. We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications. Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Allowance for losses on customer financing receivables We record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in a valuation account, the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to two components of receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables. We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the receivable agreement, without regard to any subsequent restructurings. Factors considered in assessing collectability include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. We determine a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral we would expect to realize. We review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables (after excluding receivables subject to a specific impairment allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for each customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, for example, permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall. Each quarter we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables. Warranties In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material and design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a three to four -year standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards under our authorization. These warranties are included in the programs estimate at completion. On occasion we have made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warranties issued by our BDS segments principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons hardware and are included in the contract cost estimates. These sales are generally accompanied by a six month to two -year warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate. We provide guarantees to certain commercial airplane customers which include compensation provisions for failure to meet specified aircraft performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets, and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of the related aircraft. We have agreements that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to customers for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as a reduction in Cost of products at delivery of the related aircraft. These performance warranties and claims against suppliers are included in the programs estimate at completion. Supplier Penalties We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully anticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts. Guarantees We record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. For a residual value guarantee where we received a cash premium, the liability is equal to the cash premium received at the guarantees inception. For credit guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditors default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable, for each future period the credit guarantee will be outstanding. If at inception of a guarantee, we determine there is a probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value of the guarantee as described above or (b) the probable contingent loss amount. Note 2  Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Commercial Airplanes  Boeing Military Aircraft  Network  Space Systems  Global Services  Support  Total Balance at January 1, 2015 $2,131  $961  $1,566  $461  $5,119 Acquisitions     Goodwill adjustments (14 )     (14 ) Balance at December 31, 2015 $2,123  $976  $1,566  $461  $5,126 Acquisitions (1)   Goodwill adjustments (8 )  (8 ) Balance at December 31, 2016 (1) $2,115  $1,182 $1,566 $461 $5,324 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  The increase in goodwill is primarily the result of an acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2016. The purchase price allocation for this acquisition is preliminary. ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had indefinite-lived intangible assets with carrying amounts of $490 relating to trade names. The gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization of our acquired finite-lived intangible assets were as follows at December 31: ##TABLE_START    Gross Carrying Amount  Accumulated Amortization  Gross Carrying Amount  Accumulated Amortization Distribution rights $2,281  $797  $2,245  $673 Product know-how    Customer base    Developed technology    Other    Total $4,096  $2,046  $4,001  $1,834 ##TABLE_ENDAmortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $220 and $224 . Estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding years is as follows: ##TABLE_START      Estimated amortization expense $221  $210  $185  $157  $147 ##TABLE_ENDDuring 2016 and 2015 we acquired $113 and $15 of finite-lived intangible assets, of which $31 and $0 related to non-cash investing and financing transactions. Note 3  Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earnings per share for common shares and participating securities. The undistributed earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed earnings. Basic earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. The elements used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In millions - except per share amounts)       Years ended December 31,   Net earnings $4,895  $5,176  $5,446 Less: earnings available to participating securities   Net earnings available to common shareholders $4,892  $5,172  $5,440 Basic      Basic weighted average shares outstanding 636.5  688.0  728.9 Less: participating securities 1.0  1.1  1.3 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 635.5  686.9  727.6 Diluted      Basic weighted average shares outstanding 636.5  688.0  728.9 Dilutive potential common shares (1) 7.3  8.1  9.1 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 643.8  696.1  738.0 Less: participating securities 1.0  1.1  1.3 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 642.8  695.0  736.7 Net earnings per share:      Basic $7.70  $7.52  $7.47 Diluted 7.61  7.44  7.38 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Diluted earnings per share includes any dilutive impact of stock options, restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and performance awards. ##TABLE_END The following table includes the number of shares that may be dilutive potential common shares in the future.

In the second quarter of 2014, tax benefits of $116 and $143 were recorded as a result of the 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 federal tax audit settlements. ##TABLE_ENDFederal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2013. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began the 2013-2014 federal tax audit in the fourth quarter of 2016. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2001-2016 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years. Significant components of our deferred tax (liabilities)/assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Inventory and long-term contract methods of income recognition (9,954 )  (10,401 ) Pension benefits 7,385  6,303 Retiree health care benefits 2,268  2,513 Fixed assets, intangibles and goodwill (net of valuation allowance $16 and $16) (2,007 )  (1,837 ) Other employee benefits 1,225  1,339 Customer and commercial financing (730 )  (777 ) Accrued expenses and reserves  Net operating loss, credit and capital loss carryovers (net of valuation allowance of $79 and $89) (1)  Other (57 )  (92 ) Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets (2) ($1,006 )  ($2,127 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Of the deferred tax asset for net operating loss and credit carryovers, $262 expires on or before December 31, 2036 and $15 may be carried over indefinitely. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Included in the net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are deferred tax assets in the amounts of $7,701 and $7,277 related to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. ##TABLE_END Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Deferred tax assets $13,591  $13,128 Deferred tax liabilities (14,502 )  (15,150 ) Valuation allowance (95 )  (105 ) Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets ($1,006 )  ($2,127 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have provided for U.S. deferred income taxes and foreign withholding tax in the amount of $32 on undistributed earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding tax on the remainder of undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries of approximately $850 because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that may be payable upon distribution. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position were not significant. The amounts of interest benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 . A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: ##TABLE_START    Unrecognized tax benefits  January 1 $1,617  $1,312  $1,141 Gross increases  tax positions in prior periods   Gross decreases  tax positions in prior periods (348 )  (25 )  (251 ) Gross increases  current-period tax positions   Settlements (73 )   (197 ) Lapse of statute of limitations   (1 ) Unrecognized tax benefits  December 31 $1,557  $1,617  $1,312 ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31 , 2016, 2015 and 2014 , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1,557 , $1,617 and $1,312 , respectively, of which $1,402 , $1,479 and $1,180 would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. As of December 31, 2016 , these amounts are primarily associated with U.S. federal tax issues such as the amount of research tax credits claimed, the U.S. manufacturing activity tax benefit, tax basis adjustments and U.S. taxation of foreign earnings. Also included in these amounts are accruals for domestic state tax issues such as the allocation of income among various state tax jurisdictions and the amount of state tax credits claimed. Note 5  Accounts Receivable, net Accounts receivable at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   U.S. government contracts $4,639  $4,864 Commercial Airplanes 2,432  2,250 Defense, Space  Security customers (1)  Reinsurance receivables  Other  Less valuation allowance (65 )  (94 ) Total $8,832  $8,713 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Excludes U.S. government contracts ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes our accounts receivable under long-term contracts that were unbillable or related to outstanding claims as of December 31 : ##TABLE_START  Unbillable  Claims     Current $1,919  $2,024  $38  Expected to be collected after one year 2,011  2,001  $91  Total $3,930  $4,025  $129  $70 ##TABLE_ENDUnder contract accounting unbillable receivables on long-term contracts arise when the sales or revenues based on performance attainment, though appropriately recognized, cannot be billed yet under terms of the contract as of the balance sheet date. Any adjustment for the credit quality of unbillable receivables, if required, would be recorded as a direct reduction of revenue. Factors considered in assessing the collectability of unbillable receivables include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. Unbillable receivables related to commercial customers expected to be collected after one year were  $172 and $178 at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Accounts receivable related to claims are items that we believe are earned, but are subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate realization. Accounts receivable, other than those described above, expected to be collected after one year are not material. Note 6  Inventories Inventories at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Long-term contracts in progress $12,801  $13,858 Commercial aircraft programs 52,048  55,230 Commercial spare parts, used aircraft, general stock materials and other 5,446  6,673 Inventory before advances and progress billings 70,295  75,761 Less advances and progress billings (27,096 )  (28,504 ) Total $43,199  $47,257 ##TABLE_ENDLong-Term Contracts in Progress Long-term contracts in progress includes Delta launch program inventory that is being sold at cost to United Launch Alliance ( ULA ) under an inventory supply agreement that terminates on March 31, 2021. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the inventory balance was $120 (net of advances of $220 ) and $120 (net of advances of $310 ). See indemnifications to ULA in Note 12 . Included in inventories are capitalized precontract costs of $729 and $732 at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , primarily related to KC-46A Tanker and C-17. See Note 11 . Commercial Aircraft Programs At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 787 program: $32,501 and $34,656 of work in process (including deferred production costs of $27,308 and $28,510 ), $2,398 and $2,551 of supplier advances, and $3,625 and $3,890 of unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs. At December 31, 2016 , $23,818 of 787 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and $7,115 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. During the second quarter of 2016, we determined that it was unlikely we would receive firm orders for two flight test aircraft that were produced in 2009 and a ccordingly reclassified associated costs of $1,235 from 787 program inventory to research and development expense. The reclassification also impacted 787 deferred production costs, reducing the balance by $1,011 at June 30, 2016. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 747 program: $35 and $942 of deferred production costs, net of reach-forward losses, and $284 and $377 of unamortized tooling costs. At December 31, 2016 , $233 of 747 deferred production and unamortized tooling costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and $86 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , work in process inventory included a number of completed 747 aircraft that we expect to recover from future orders. Commercial aircraft programs inventory included amounts credited in cash or other consideration (early issue sales consideration) to airline customers totaling $3,117 and $3,166 at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Used aircraft in inventories at Commercial Airplanes totaled $150  and $267  at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Note 7  Customer Financing Customer financing primarily relates to the Boeing Capital (BCC) segment and consisted of the following at December 31: ##TABLE_START   Financing receivables:    Investment in sales-type/finance leases $1,482  $1,620 Notes  Total financing receivables 2,289  1,876 Operating lease equipment, at cost, less accumulated depreciation of $359 and $338 1,922  1,710 Gross customer financing 4,211  3,586 Less allowance for losses on receivables (10 )  (16 ) Total $4,201  $3,570 ##TABLE_ENDThe components of investment in sales-type/finance leases at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Minimum lease payments receivable $1,321  $1,537 Estimated residual value of leased assets  Unearned income (344 )  (447 ) Total $1,482  $1,620 ##TABLE_ENDOperating lease equipment primarily includes large commercial jet aircraft and regional jet aircraft. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , operating lease equipment included $6 and $49 available for sale or re-lease. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had firm lease commitments for $0 and $15 of this equipment. Financing receivable balances evaluated for impairment at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Individually evaluated for impairment $55  $86 Collectively evaluated for impairment 2,234  1,790 Total financing receivables $2,289  $1,876 ##TABLE_ENDWe determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , we individually evaluated for impairment customer financing receivables of $55 and $86 , of which $44 and $0 were determined to be impaired. We recorded no allowance for losses on these impaired receivables as the collateral values exceeded the carrying values of the receivables. Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Income is recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer . The average recorded investment in impaired financing receivables for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $41 and the related interest income was insignificant. The change in the allowance for losses on financing receivables for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 , consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    Beginning balance - January 1 ($16 )  ($21 )  ($49 ) Customer financing valuation benefit   Ending balance - December 31 ($10 )  ($16 )  ($21 ) Collectively evaluated for impairment ($10 )  ($16 )  ($21 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customer financing receivables are customer credit ratings, default rates and collateral values. We assign internal credit ratings for all customers and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers. Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies. Our financing receivable balances at December 31 by internal credit rating category are shown below: ##TABLE_START Rating categories  BBB $1,324  $973 BB  B  CCC  Other  Total carrying value of financing receivables $2,289  $1,876 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2016 , our allowance related to receivables with ratings of B, BB and BBB. We applied default rates that averaged 12.7% , 8.8% and 1.1% to the exposure associated with those receivables. Customer Financing Exposure Customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance and overall market conditions and may be subject to reduced valuation with market decline. Declines in collateral values could result in asset impairments, reduced finance lease income, and an increase in the allowance for losses. Our customer financing collateral is concentrated in 747-8 and out-of-production aircraft. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have experienced greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft. The majority of customer financing carrying values are concentrated in the following aircraft models at December 31: ##TABLE_START   717 Aircraft ($301 and $372 accounted for as operating leases) $1,282  $1,415 747-8 Aircraft ($1,086 and $916 accounted for as operating leases) 1,111  MD-80 Aircraft (Accounted for as sales-type finance leases)  757 Aircraft ($43 and $48 accounted for as operating leases)  767 Aircraft ($85 and $84 accounted for as operating leases)  777 Aircraft (Accounted for as notes)  747-400 Aircraft (Accounted for as operating leases)  737 Aircraft (Accounted for as operating leases)  ##TABLE_ENDCharges related to customer financing asset impairment for the years ended December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Boeing Capital $45  $162  $139 Other Boeing   Total $66  $162  $184 ##TABLE_ENDScheduled receipts on customer financing are as follows: ##TABLE_START Year      Beyond 2021 Principal payments on notes receivable $242  $105  $159  $125  $176  Sales-type/finance lease payments receivable      $334 Operating lease equipment payments receivable      ##TABLE_ENDNote 8  Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Land $535  $536 Buildings and land improvements 13,796  12,397 Machinery and equipment 13,569  13,187 Construction in progress 1,790  2,242 Gross property, plant and equipment 29,690  28,362 Less accumulated depreciation (16,883 )  (16,286 ) Total $12,807  $12,076 ##TABLE_ENDDepreciation expense was $1,418 , $1,357 and $1,414 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Interest capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled $170 , $158 and $102 , respectively. Rental expense for leased properties was $287 , $267 and $277 , for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. At December 31, 2016 , minimum rental payments under capital leases aggregated $144 . Minimum rental payments under operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more aggregated $1,475 , net of sublease payments of $19 at December 31, 2016 . Payments due under operating and capital leases net of sublease amounts and non-cancellable future rentals during the next five years are as follows: ##TABLE_START      Minimum operating lease payments, net of sublease amounts $233  $210  $182  $135  $95 Minimum capital lease payments     ##TABLE_ENDAccounts payable related to purchases of property, plant and equipment were $292 and $502 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Note 9  Investments Our investments, which are recorded in Short-term and other investments or Investments, consisted of the following at December 31: ##TABLE_START   Equity method investments (1) $1,242  $1,230 Time deposits  Available-for-sale investments  Other investments  Restricted cash  cash equivalents (2)  Total $2,545  $2,034 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Dividends received were $314 and $239 during 2016 and 2015 . Retained earnings at December 31, 2016 include undistributed earnings from our equity method investments of $292 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Reflects amounts restricted in support of our workers compensation programs and insurance premiums. ##TABLE_END Equity Method Investments Our equity method investments consisted of the following as of December 31: ##TABLE_START  Segment Ownership Percentages  Investment Balance      United Launch Alliance Network  Space Systems (NSS) 50%  $914  $908 Other Commercial Airplanes, NSS and Global Services  Support (GSS)    Total equity method investments   $1,242  $1,230 ##TABLE_ENDNote 10  Other Assets Sea Launch At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , Other assets included $356 of receivables related to our former investment in the Sea Launch venture which became payable by certain Sea Launch partners following Sea Launchs bankruptcy filing in June 2009. The $356 includes $147 related to a payment made by us under a bank guarantee on behalf of Sea Launch and $209 related to loans (partner loans) we made to Sea Launch. The net amounts owed to Boeing by each of the partners are as follows: S.P. Koroley Rocket and Space Corporation Energia of Russia (RSC Energia)  $223 , PO Yuzhnoye Mashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukraine  $89 and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine  $44 . On February 1, 2013, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launch partners of the $147 bank guarantee payment and the $209 partner loan obligations. On May 12, 2016, the court issued a judgment in favor of Boeing relating to the bank guarantee payment and the partner loan obligations. In December 2016, we reached an agreement which we believe will enable us to recover the outstanding receivable balance from RSC Energia over the next several years. The agreement is subject to certain contingencies which we expect will be resolved during the first quarter of 2017. We will continue to pursue collection efforts against the former Ukrainian partners in connection with the court judgment and continue to believe the partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and remedies. In the event we are unable to secure reimbursement from the Sea Launch partners, we could incur additional charges. Our current assessment as to the collectability of these receivables takes into account the current economic conditions in Russia and Ukraine, although we will continue to monitor the situation. Spirit AeroSystems As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , Other assets included $143 and $140 of receivables related to indemnifications from Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. (Spirit), for costs incurred related to pension and retiree medical obligations of former Boeing employees that were subsequently employed by Spirit. During the fourth quarter of 2014, Boeing filed a complaint against Spirit in Delaware Superior Court seeking to enforce our rights to indemnification and to recover from Spirit amounts incurred by Boeing for pension and retiree medical obligations. We expect to fully recover from Spirit. Note 11  Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Accrued compensation and employee benefit costs $5,720  $5,624 Environmental  Product warranties 1,414  1,485 Forward loss recognition 1,385  Dividends payable  Income Taxes Payable  Other 4,655  4,599 Total $14,691  $14,014 ##TABLE_ENDEnvironmental The following table summarizes environmental remediation activity during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 . ##TABLE_START   Beginning balance  January 1 $566  $601 Reductions for payments made (47 )  (78 ) Changes in estimates  Ending balance  December 31 $562  $566 ##TABLE_ENDThe liabilities recorded represent our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred to remediate sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios that includes the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. There are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by $857 and $853 . Product Warranties The following table summarizes product warranty activity recorded during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 . ##TABLE_START   Beginning balance  January 1 $1,485  $1,504 Additions for current year deliveries  Reductions for payments made (309 )  (323 ) Changes in estimates (118 )  (117 ) Ending balance  December 31 $1,414  $1,485 ##TABLE_ENDCommercial Aircraft Commitments In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and airline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer. Trade-in commitment agreements at December 31, 2016 have expiration dates from 2017 through 2026 . At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , total contractual trade-in commitments were $1,485 and $1,585 . As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we estimated that it was probable we would be obligated to perform on certain of these commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling $126 and $240 and the fair value of the related trade-in aircraft was $126 and $240 . Financing Commitments Financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, and refinancing of delivered aircraft, totaled $14,847 and $16,283 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 . The estimated earliest potential funding dates for these commitments as of December 31, 2016 are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Total $2,432 3,500 3,374 2,022 1,471 Thereafter 2,048  $14,847 ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2016 , all of these financing commitments related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. We have concluded that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralization and interest rates, under which funding would be provided. Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $4,701 and $4,968 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Commitments to ULA We and Lockheed Martin Corporation have each committed to provide ULA with additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. As of December 31, 2016 , ULAs total remaining obligation to Boeing under the inventory supply agreement was $120 . See Note 6 . F/A-18 At December 31, 2016 , our backlog included 23 F/A-18 aircraft under contract with the U.S. Navy and funding has been authorized and appropriated for an additional 12 aircraft. In addition, Kuwait has requested up to 40 aircraft. We have begun work or authorized suppliers to begin working on aircraft beyond those already in backlog in anticipation of these future orders. At December 31, 2016, we had $57 of capitalized precontract costs and $790 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers associated with F/A-18 aircraft. Company Owned Life Insurance McDonnell Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life insurance policies with a cash surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the cash surrender value was $483 and $487 and the total loans were $456 and $456 . As we have the right to offset the loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 . United States Government Defense Environment Overview The new U.S. administration and key members of the 115th Congress have expressed a general desire to reverse the effects of the budgetary reductions of the past several years. However, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (The Act), which mandated limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, remains in effect through the 2021 government fiscal year causing budget uncertainty and continued risk of future sequestration cuts.  In addition, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) and other government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows.  Funding timeliness also remains a risk as the federal government is currently operating under a continuing resolution that expires on April 28, 2017. If Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills before the continuing resolution expires, a government shutdown could result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts or program-level appropriations. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. DoD or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders.  BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work. BDS fixed-price contracts with significant development work include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker and commercial and military satellites. The operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost and revenue estimates could result in lower margins or material charges for reach-forward losses. For example, during 2016, we have recorded additional reach-forward losses of $1,128 on the KC-46A Tanker program and a charge of $162 resulting from a reach-forward loss of $38 on the Commercial Crew Program. Moreover, both of these programs remain subject to additional reach-forward losses if we experience further technical or quality issues, schedule delays, or increased costs. KC-46A Tanker  In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. In August 2016, the USAF authorized LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at $2.8 billion . At December 31, 2016 , we had approximately $311 of capitalized precontract costs and $1,016 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers. Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts Our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve for amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide refunds to the U.S. government. Russia/Ukraine We continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. A number of our commercial customers also have operations in Russia and Ukraine. To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to production or deliveries. Should suppliers or customers experience disruption, our production and/or deliveries could be materially impacted. 747 Program Lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower-than-expected growth of global freight traffic have continued to drive market uncertainties, pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated. As a result, during 2016, we canceled previous plans to return to a production rate of 1.0 aircraft per month beginning in 2019, resulting in a reduction in the program accounting quantity from 1,574 to 1,555 aircraft. This reduction in the program accounting quantity, together with lower anticipated revenues from future sales and higher costs associated with producing fewer airplanes, resulted in a reach-forward loss of $1,188 in the second quarter. We previously recognized reach-forward losses of $885 and $70 during the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, respectively, related to the prior decision to reduce the production rate to 0.5 per month and lower estimated revenue from future sales due to ongoing pricing and market pressures. We reduced the rate from 1.0 to 0.5 per month in September 2016 . The adjusted program accounting quantity includes 26 undelivered aircraft, currently scheduled to be produced through 2019. We continue to have a number of completed aircraft in inventory as well as unsold production positions and we remain focused on obtaining additional orders and implementing cost-reduction efforts. If we are unable to obtain sufficient orders and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, we could record additional losses that may be material, and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747. 787 Program The 787 program continued to have near breakeven gross margins. The combination of production challenges, change incorporation on early build aircraft, schedule delays, customer and supplier impacts and changes to price escalation factors has created significant pressure on program profitability. We are continuing to monitor wide-body demand and if sufficient orders do not materialize during the next several quarters we may consider appropriate adjustments to planned production rates. If risks related to these challenges, together with risks associated with planned production rates and productivity improvements, supply chain management or introducing or manufacturing the 787-10 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could record a reach-forward loss that may be material. Note 12  Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees. The following table provides quantitative data regarding our third party guarantees. The maximum potential payments represent a worst-case scenario, and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset our payments under guarantees. The carrying amount of liabilities represents the amount included in Accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_START  Maximum Potential Payments  Estimated Proceeds from Collateral/ Recourse  Carrying Amount of Liabilities December 31, 2015  2015  2015 Contingent repurchase commitments $1,306 $1,529  $1,306 $1,510  $9 $7 Indemnifications to ULA:         Contributed Delta program launch inventory 107       Contract pricing 261     7 Other Delta contracts 231     5 Credit guarantees 30  27  2 ##TABLE_ENDContingent Repurchase Commitments The repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase commitments is generally lower than the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date. Indemnifications to ULA In 2006, we agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 of Boeing Delta launch program inventory included in contributed assets plus $1,860 of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021 . Since inception, ULA has consumed $1,283 of the $1,360 of inventory that was contributed by us and has yet to consume $77 . Under the inventory supply agreement, we have recorded revenues and cost of sales of $1,472 through December 31, 2016 . ULA has made payments of $1,740 to us under the inventory supply agreement and we have made $63 of net indemnification payments to ULA. We agreed to indemnify ULA against potential losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the USAF for four satellite missions. In 2009, ULA filed a complaint before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) for a contract adjustment for the price of two of these missions, followed in 2011 by a subsequent notice of appeal with respect to a third mission. The USAF did not exercise an option for a fourth mission prior to the expiration of the contract. During the second quarter of 2016, the ASBCA ruled that ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing for each of the three missions and remanded to the parties to negotiate appropriate pricing. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the USAF appealed the ASBCAs ruling. If the USAFs appeal of the ASBCA's ruling is successful, and ULA is ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining additional pricing, we may be responsible for an indemnification payment up to $261 and may record up to $277 in pre-tax losses associated with the three missions. Potential payments for Other Delta contracts include $85 related to deferred support costs and $91 related to deferred production costs. In June 2011, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) notified ULA that it had determined that $271 of deferred support costs are not recoverable under government contracts. In December 2011, the DCMA notified ULA of the potential non-recoverability of an additional $114 of deferred production costs. ULA and Boeing believe that all costs are recoverable and in November 2011, ULA filed a certified claim with the USAF for collection of deferred support and production costs. The USAF issued a final decision denying ULAs certified claim in May 2012. On June 14, 2012, Boeing and ULA filed a suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking recovery of the deferred support and production costs from the U.S. government. On November 9, 2012, the U.S. government filed an answer to our claim and asserted a counterclaim for credits that it alleges were offset by deferred support cost invoices. We believe that the U.S. governments counterclaim is without merit, and have filed an answer challenging it on multiple grounds. The litigation is in the discovery phase and the Court has not yet set a trial date. If, contrary to our belief, it is determined that some or all of the deferred support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record pre-tax losses and make indemnification payments to ULA for up to $317 of the costs questioned by the DCMA. Other Indemnifications In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and our Commercial Airplanes facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 11 . Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees, principally to facilitate the sale and/or financing of commercial aircraft. Under these arrangements, we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that lease or loan payments are not made by the original lessee or debtor or certain specified services are not performed. A substantial portion of these guarantees has been extended on behalf of original lessees or debtors with less than investment-grade credit. Our commercial aircraft credit guarantees are collateralized by the underlying commercial aircraft and certain other assets. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire within the next four years. Industrial Revenue Bonds Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by the City of Wichita and St. Louis County were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property at our Wichita and St. Louis sites. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a ten-year property tax abatement and a sales tax exemption from the Kansas Department of Revenue, and a twelve-year property tax abatement and sales tax exemption from St. Louis County. We record these properties on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. We have also purchased the IRBs and therefore are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the properties purchased with the IRB proceeds. The liabilities and IRB assets are equal and are reported net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. During 2016, the City of Wichita IRBs were settled. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the assets and liabilities associated with the IRBs were $64 and $584 . Note 13  Debt On May 18, 2016 , we issued $1,200 of fixed rate senior notes consisting of $400 due June 15, 2023 that bear an annual interest rate of 1.875% , $400 due June 15, 2026 that bear an annual interest rate of 2.25% , and $400 due June 15, 2046 that bear an annual interest rate of 3.375% . The notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds of the issuance totaled $1,170 , after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. Interest incurred, including amounts capitalized, was $535 , $497 and $504 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Interest expense recorded by BCC is reflected as Boeing Capital interest expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Total Company interest payments were $523 , $488 and $511 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. We have $5,000 currently available under credit line agreements, of which $2,480 is a 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in November 2017 , $2,370 expires in November 2021 , $90  expires in November 2019 and $60 expires in November 2017 . The 364-day credit facility has a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration date. We continue to be in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt or credit facility agreements. Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Unsecured debt securities $255  $1,004 Non-recourse debt and notes  Capital lease obligations  Other notes  Total $384  $1,234 ##TABLE_ENDDebt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Unsecured debt securities    Variable rate: 3-month USD LIBOR plus 12.5 basis points due 2017 $250  $250 0.95% - 4.88% due through 2046 5,250  5,075 5.88% - 6.88% due through 2043 2,383  2,381 7.25% - 8.75% due through 2043 1,641  1,645 Non-recourse debt and notes    6.98% - 7.38% notes due through 2021  Capital lease obligations due through 2024  Other notes  Total debt $9,952  $9,964 ##TABLE_ENDTotal debt is attributable to: ##TABLE_START   BCC $2,864  $2,355 Other Boeing 7,088  7,609 Total debt $9,952  $9,964 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2016 , $127 of debt (non-recourse debt, notes and capital lease obligations) was collateralized by customer financing assets totaling $259 .

Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans participants, and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for future benefit payments. We also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for approximately half those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered by most United Auto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage. The funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). We have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Other assets, and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in Accrued liabilities. The components of net periodic benefit cost were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits Years ended December 31,      Service cost $604  $1,764  $1,661  $128  $140  $129 Interest cost 3,050  2,990  3,058    Expected return on plan assets (3,999 )  (4,031 )  (4,169 )  (8 )  (8 )  (8 ) Amortization of prior service costs/(credits)    (126 )  (136 )  (144 ) Recognized net actuarial loss  1,577  1,020    Settlement/curtailment/other losses      Net periodic benefit cost $523  $2,786  $2,208  $278  $285  $275             Net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations $1,979  $2,366  $3,215  $274  $288  $287 ##TABLE_ENDIn 2016 , we recorded charges of $40  related to curtailments and other benefit changes associated with certain of our defined benefit plans. The following tables show changes in the benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status of both pensions and OPB for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Benefit obligation balances presented below reflect the PBO for our pension plans, and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations (APBO) for our OPB plans. ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits     Change in benefit obligation        Beginning balance $74,388  $78,391  $7,138  $7,306 Service cost  1,764   Interest cost 3,050  2,990   Plan participants contributions    Amendments  (1,379 )  (57 )  (19 ) Actuarial (gain)/loss 2,669  (3,505 )  (612 )  (89 ) Settlement/curtailment/other (63 )  (457 )   Gross benefits paid (3,903 )  (3,382 )  (469 )  (486 ) Subsidies      Exchange rate adjustment (7 )  (39 )   (15 ) Ending balance $76,745  $74,388  $6,431  $7,138 Change in plan assets        Beginning balance at fair value $56,514  $61,119  $132  $141 Actual return/(loss) on plan assets 3,885  (701 )   Company contribution    Plan participants contributions    Settlement payments (24 )  (649 )   Benefits paid (3,791 )  (3,284 )  (18 )  (20 ) Exchange rate adjustment (6 )  (35 )   Ending balance at fair value $56,692  $56,514  $134  $132 Amounts recognized in statement of financial position at December 31 consist of:        Other assets $3  $10     Other accrued liabilities (113 )  (101 )  ($381 )  ($390 ) Accrued retiree health care   (5,916 )  (6,616 ) Accrued pension plan liability, net (19,943 )  (17,783 )     Net amount recognized ($20,053 )  ($17,874 )  ($6,297 )  ($7,006 ) ##TABLE_ENDAmounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits     Net actuarial loss $22,802  $20,871  $152  $781 Prior service (credits) (1,243 )  (1,195 )  (328 )  (397 ) Total recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss $21,559  $19,676  ($176 )  $384 ##TABLE_ENDThe estimated amount that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during the year ending December 31, 2017 is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits Recognized net actuarial loss $801  $10 Amortization of prior service (credits) (41 )  (137 ) Total $760  ($127 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for all pension plans was $74,240 and $72,330 at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Key information for our plans with ABO in excess of plan assets as of December 31 was as follows: ##TABLE_START   Projected benefit obligation $76,586  $74,188 Accumulated benefit obligation 74,081  72,121 Fair value of plan assets 56,530  56,306 ##TABLE_ENDAssumptions The following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31 of each year and the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year. ##TABLE_START December 31,   Discount rate:      Pension 4.00 %  4.20 %  3.90 % Other postretirement benefits 3.70 %  3.80 %  3.50 % Expected return on plan assets 6.80 %  7.00 %  7.00 % Rate of compensation increase 4.40 %  4.00 %  3.80 % ##TABLE_ENDThe discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high quality bonds that are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yields developed from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. A portfolio of about 400 bonds is used to construct the yield curve. Since corporate bond yields are generally not available at maturities beyond 30 years, it is assumed that spot rates will remain level beyond that 30-year point. The present value of each plans benefits is calculated by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows. All bonds are U.S. issues, with a minimum outstanding of $50. The pension funds expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the upcoming plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five -year moving average of plan assets. As of December 31, 2016 , the MRVA was approximately $2,352 greater than the fair market value of assets. Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows: ##TABLE_START December 31,   Health care cost trend rate assumed next year 6.50 %  6.50 %  7.00 % Ultimate trend rate 5.00 %  5.00 %  5.00 % Year that trend reached ultimate rate   ##TABLE_ENDAssumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. To determine the health care cost trend rates we look at a combination of information including ongoing claims cost monitoring, annual statistical analyses of claims data, reconciliation of forecast claims against actual claims, review of trend assumptions of other plan sponsors and national health trends, and adjustments for plan design changes, workforce changes, and changes in plan participant behavior. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect: ##TABLE_START  Increase  Decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost $48  ($40 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation  (496 ) ##TABLE_ENDPlan Assets Investment Strategy The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified. We periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investment benchmarks for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced on a monthly basis. The actual and target allocations by asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Actual Allocations  Target Allocations Asset Class    Fixed income %  %  %  % Global equity    Private equity    Real estate and real assets    Hedge funds    Total %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDFixed income securities are invested primarily in a diversified portfolio of long duration instruments. Global equity securities are invested in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various industries and market capitalizations. Real estate and real assets include global private investments that may be held through an investment in a limited partnership (LP) or other fund structures and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the case of real estate). Real estate includes, but is not limited to, investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include, but are not limited to, investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber), commodities and infrastructure. Private equity investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) and fund-of-funds that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies. Hedge fund investments seek to capitalize on inefficiencies identified across and within different asset classes or markets. Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to directional, event driven, relative value, long-short and multi-strategy. Investment managers are retained for explicit investment roles specified by contractual investment guidelines. Certain investment managers are authorized to use derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve the desired market exposure of a security or an index, transfer value-added performance between asset classes, achieve the desired currency exposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation. As a percentage of total pension plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were 6.0% and 13.1% for fixed income, including to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and 1.2% and 4.0% for global equity and commodities at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Risk Management In managing the plan assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach and are integral to the overall investment strategy. Further, asset classes are constructed to achieve diversification by investment strategy, by investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored regularly through the custodian. Credit parameters for counterparties have been established for managers permitted to trade over-the-counter derivatives. Valuation is governed through several types of procedures, including reviews of manager valuation policies, custodian valuation processes, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconciliation, and periodic, security-specific valuation testing . Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 . The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015  Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fixed income securities:         Corporate $16,730 $16,723 $7 $16,339 $16,336 $3 U.S. government and agencies 4,876 4,875 4,801 4,800 Mortgage backed and asset backed 370 830 448 Municipal 1,398 1,398 1,475  1,475 Sovereign 782   Other $9 83 $9 Derivatives:         Assets 40 25 Liabilities (38 ) (38 ) (67 ) (67 ) Cash equivalents and other short-term investments 1,037 1,037 1,015 1,015 Equity securities:         U.S. common and preferred stock 5,374 5,373 5,165 5,164 Non-U.S. common and preferred stock 5,746 5,746 5,712 5,710 Derivatives:         Assets 6 11 Liabilities (8 ) (8 ) (3 ) (3 ) Private equity   3 Real estate and real assets:         Real estate 468 447 Real assets 372 5 351 6 Derivatives:         Assets 4 3 Liabilities (1 ) (1 ) (2 ) (2 ) Total $37,866 $11,968 $25,548 $350 $37,376 $11,681 $25,231 $464          Fixed income common/collective/pooled funds $1,625    $1,753    Fixed income other       Equity common/collective pooled funds 4,962    4,948    Private equity 2,639    2,611    Real estate and real assets 3,625    3,637    Hedge funds 5,441    5,478    Total investments measured at NAV as a practical expedient $18,519    $18,674             Cash $160    $162    Receivables       Payables (227 )    (133 )    Total $56,692    $56,514    ##TABLE_ENDFixed income securities are primarily valued upon a market approach, using matrix pricing and considering a securitys relationship to other securities for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or an income approach, converting future cash flows to a single present value amount. Inputs used in developing fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads. Common/collective/pooled funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their NAVs that are calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives included in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued using an income approach with inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates. Exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Cash equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingled fund (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued daily using a market approach with inputs that include quoted market prices for similar instruments. In the event a market price is not available for instruments with an original maturity of one year or less, amortized cost is used as a proxy for fair value. Common and preferred stock equity securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Private equity and private debt NAV valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) we use NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Real estate and real asset NAV valuations are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) NAVs are adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Publicly traded REITs and infrastructure stocks are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Hedge funds consist of direct hedge funds and fund-of-fund limited liability company (LLC) structures. For direct hedge funds the NAVs are generally based on valuation of the underlying investments. This is primarily done by applying a market or income valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument held. The NAVs of the fund-of-funds are based on the NAVs of the underlying hedge funds as well as any cash and accruals held at the fund-of-fund level. Redemptions in hedge funds are based on specific terms and conditions of the individual funds. Investments in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the General Partner (GP), fund manager or third party administrator. Additionally, some investments in fixed income and equity are made via commingled vehicles and are valued in a similar fashion. Pension assets invested in commingled and limited partnership structures rely on the NAV of these investments as the practical expedient for the valuations. The following tables present a reconciliation of Level 3 assets (excluding investments which are valued using NAVs as a practical expedient) held during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Transfers into and out of Level 3 are reported at the beginning-of-year values. ##TABLE_START  January 1 2016 Balance  Net Realized and Unrealized Gains/(Losses)  Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements  Net Transfers (Out of) Level 3  December 31 2016 Balance Fixed income securities:          Corporate (1) $11    ($1 )  ($3 )  $7 U.S. government and agencies     Mortgage backed and asset backed (1)  $7  (93 )  (18 )  Equity securities:         U.S. common and preferred stock     Non-U.S. common and preferred stock   (2 )    Private equity  (3 )     Real assets   (1 )   Total $464  $4  ($97 )  ($21 )  $350 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  January 1 2015 Balance  Net Realized and Unrealized (Losses)  Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements  Net Transfers Into Level 3  December 31 2015 Balance Fixed income securities:          Corporate (2) $1   $1  $1  $3 U.S. government and agencies (2)        $1 Mortgage backed and asset backed (2)  ($9 )  (157 )   Other   (3 )      Equity securities:          U.S. common and preferred stock        Non-U.S. common and preferred stock    (2 )   Private equity      Real assets      Total $621  ($12 )  ($153 )  $8  $464 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Certain fixed income securities were reclassified from mortgage backed and asset backed to corporate on January 1, 2016. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Certain fixed income securities were reclassified from corporate and mortgage backed and asset backed to U.S. government and agencies on January 1, 2015. ##TABLE_ENDThe changes in unrealized gains/(losses) for Level 3 mortgage backed and asset backed fixed income securities still held at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $4  and  ($10) . OPB Plan Assets The majority of OPB plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised of approximately 60% equities and 40% debt securities. The index fund is valued using a market approach based on the quoted market price of an identical instrument (Level 1). The expected rate of return on these assets does not have a material effect on the net periodic benefit cost. Cash Flows Contributions Required pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ), as well as rules governing funding of our non-U.S. pension plans, are expected to be $200 in 2017 . In 2017 we expect to make contributions to our pension plans of approximately $500 . Estimated Future Benefit Payments The table below reflects the total pension benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants share of the cost, which is funded by participant contributions. OPB payments reflect our portion only. ##TABLE_START Year(s)      2022-2026 Pensions $4,558  $4,622  $4,611  $4,662  $4,637  $23,108 Other postretirement benefits:            Gross benefits paid      2,654 Subsidies (32 )  (31 )  (31 )  (31 )  (30 )  (143 ) Net other postretirement benefits $466  $484  $499  $517  $523  $2,511 ##TABLE_ENDTermination Provisions Certain of the pension plans provide that, in the event there is a change in control of the Company which is not approved by the Board of Directors and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required by ERISA , and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits in our group insurance benefit programs. Should we terminate certain pension plans under conditions in which the plans assets exceed that plans obligations, the U.S. government will be entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plans assets based on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts. Defined Contribution Plans We provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expense for these defined contribution plans was $1,413 , $768 and $764 in 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Note 15  Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements Share-Based Compensation Our 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated, permits awards of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or units, performance shares, performance restricted stock or units, performance units and other stock and cash-based awards to our employees, officers, directors, consultants, and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock authorized for issuance under the plan is 87,000,000 . Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfy these issuances during 2017 . Share-based plans expense is primarily included in General and administrative expense since it is incentive compensation issued primarily to our executives. The share-based plans expense and related income tax benefit were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Stock options $4  $30  $62 Restricted stock units and other awards   Share-based plans expense $193  $190  $195 Income tax benefit $69  $68  $70 ##TABLE_ENDStock Options We discontinued granting options in 2014, replacing them with performance-based restricted stock units. Options granted through January 2014 had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. The stock options vest over a period of three years and were fully vested at December 31, 2016 , except for 6,221 shares which vested in January 2017. Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2016 is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Shares  Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share  Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years)  Aggregate Intrinsic Value Number of shares under option:        Outstanding at beginning of year 12,925,944  $73.44     Exercised (4,270,336)  75.04     Forfeited (6,270)  84.20     Expired (2,726)  74.43     Outstanding at end of year 8,646,612  $72.64  4.67  $718 Exercisable at end of year 8,640,391  $72.60  4.67  $718 ##TABLE_ENDThe total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $265 , $385 and $250 , respectively. Cash received from options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $321 , $399 and $343 with a related tax benefit of $94 , $135 and $87 , respectively, derived from the compensation deductions resulting from these option exercises. The grant date fair value of stock options vested during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $27 , $56 and $87 , respectively. Restricted Stock Units In February 2016, 2015 and 2014 , we granted to our executives 777,837 , 590,778 and 695,651  restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of $117.50 , $154.64 and $129.58 per unit, respectively. The RSUs granted under this program will vest and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. In addition to RSUs awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant RSUs to certain executives and employees to encourage retention or to reward various achievements. These RSUs are labeled other RSUs in the table below. The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average of the high and low stock prices on the date of grant. RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2016 was as follows: ##TABLE_START  Long-Term Incentive Program  Other Number of units:    Outstanding at beginning of year 2,346,640  1,121,001 Granted 811,317  391,961 Dividends 66,609  35,848 Forfeited (165,111 )  (46,115 ) Distributed (1,244,811 )  (424,775 ) Outstanding at end of year 1,814,644  1,077,920 Unrecognized compensation cost $92  $58 Weighted average remaining contractual life (years) 1.8  3.8 ##TABLE_ENDThe number of vested but undistributed RSUs at December 31, 2016 was not significant. Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PBRSUs) are stock units that pay out based on the Companys total shareholder return as compared to a group of peer companies over a three-year period. The award payout can range from 0% to 200% of the initial PBRSU grant, but will not exceed 400% of the initial value (excluding dividend equivalent credits). The PBRSUs granted under this program will vest at the payout amount and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) remains eligible under the award and, if the award is earned, will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the PBRSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. In February 2016, 2015 and 2014 , we granted to our executives 721,176 , 556,203 and 662,215 PBRSUs as part of our long-term incentive program. Compensation expense for the award is recognized over the three-year performance period based upon the grant date fair value. The grant date fair values were estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model with the assumptions presented below. The model includes no expected dividend yield as the units earn dividend equivalents. ##TABLE_START Grant Year Grant Date Performance Period Expected Volatility Risk Free Interest Rate Grant Date Fair Value 2/22/2016 3 years 22.44 % 0.92 % 126.74 2/23/2015 3 years 20.35 % 1.03 % 164.26 2/24/2014 3 years 24.2 % 0.72 % 136.12 ##TABLE_ENDPBRSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2016 was as follows: ##TABLE_START   Long-Term Incentive Program Number of units:   Outstanding at beginning of year  1,123,035 Granted  721,176 Dividends  52,540 Forfeited  (150,240 ) Outstanding at end of year  1,746,511 Unrecognized compensation cost  $86 Weighted average remaining contractual life (years)  1.8 ##TABLE_ENDOther Compensation Arrangements Performance Awards Performance Awards are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a three-year period. Each unit has an initial value of $100 dollars. The amount payable at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars per unit, depending on the Companys performance against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to pay these awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on the estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period. During 2016, 2015 and 2014 , we granted Performance Awards to our executives as part of our long-term incentive program with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals for each three -year period following the grant date. The minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out for the 2016, 2015 and 2014 Performance Awards is $338 , $322 and $315 , respectively. The 2014 grant is expected to be paid out in cash in March 2017 . Deferred Compensation The Company has a deferred compensation plan which permits executives to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus, and certain other incentive awards. Participants can diversify deferred compensation among 23 investment funds including a Boeing stock unit account. Total expense related to deferred compensation was $46 , $63 and $44 in 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the deferred compensation liability which is being marked to market was $1,126 and $1,191 . Note 16  Shareholders Equity On December 12, 2016 , the Board approved a new repurchase plan for up to $14,000 of common stock, replacing the previously authorized program. The program will expire when we have used all authorized funds or is otherwise terminated. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , there were 1,200,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. No preferred stock has been issued.

These are included in the net periodic pension cost of which a portion is allocated to production as inventoried costs. See Note 14 . ##TABLE_ENDNote 17  Derivative Financial Instruments Cash Flow Hedges Our cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage currency risk associated with certain transactions, specifically forecasted sales and purchases made in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2022 . We use commodity derivatives, such as swaps and fixed-price purchase commitments to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. Our commodity contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2020 . Fair Value Hedges Interest rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt. The net change in fair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in Boeing Capital interest expense. Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment We have entered into agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives and international business requirements. These agreements are derivative instruments for accounting purposes. The quantities of aluminum in these agreements offset and are priced at prevailing market prices. We also hold certain foreign currency forward contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Notional Amounts and Fair Values The notional amounts and fair values of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Notional amounts (1) Other assets Accrued liabilities   2016  2016  Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:          Foreign exchange contracts $2,584  $2,727 $34  $23 ($225 )  ($304 ) Interest rate contracts  6     Commodity contracts  7  (5 )  (13 ) Derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment:          Foreign exchange contracts  21  (17 )  (11 ) Commodity contracts       Total derivatives $3,875  $4,053  (247 )  (328 ) Netting arrangements    (45 )  (23 )  Net recorded balance    $23  $15 ($202 ) ($305 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Notional amounts represent the gross contract/notional amount of the derivatives outstanding. ##TABLE_ENDGains/(losses) associated with our cash flow and undesignated hedging transactions and their effect on Other comprehensive income/(loss) and Net earnings were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  Effective portion recognized in Other comprehensive income/(loss), net of taxes:    Foreign exchange contracts ($9 )  ($136 ) Commodity contracts  (4 ) Effective portion reclassified out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings, net of taxes:    Foreign exchange contracts (70 )  (67 ) Commodity contracts (8 )  (12 ) Forward points recognized in Other income, net:    Foreign exchange contracts  Undesignated derivatives recognized in Other income, net:    Foreign exchange contracts (2 )  (1 ) ##TABLE_ENDBased on our portfolio of cash flow hedges, we expect to reclassify losses of $101 (pre-tax) out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings during the next 12 months. Ineffectiveness related to our hedges recognized in Other income was insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 . We have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. For foreign exchange contracts with original maturities of at least five years, our derivative counterparties could require settlement if we default on our five-year credit facility. For certain commodity contracts, our counterparties could require collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and commodity contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at December 31, 2016 was $46 . At December 31, 2016 , there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives. Note 18  Significant Group Concentrations of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments involving potential credit risk are predominantly with commercial aircraft customers and the U.S. government. Of the $13,108 in gross accounts receivable and gross customer financing included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2016 , $6,380 related predominantly to commercial aircraft customers ( $2,175 of accounts receivable and $4,205 of customer financing) and $4,639 related to the U.S. government. Of the $4,211 in gross customer financing, $2,760 related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit including Volga Dnepr Affiliates, Silk Way Airlines and American Airlines who were associated with 18% , 9% and 6% , respectively, of our financing portfolio. Financing for aircraft is collateralized by security in the related asset and in some instances security in other assets as well. Other Risk As of December 31, 2016 , approximately 38% of our total workforce was represented by collective bargaining agreements. Note 19  Fair Value Measurements The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy. ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015  Total Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Assets       Money market funds $2,858 $2,858  $4,504 $4,504  Available-for-sale investments:       Commercial paper  87  Corporate notes  79  U.S. government agencies  83  Other 46  20  Derivatives  15  $15 Total assets $3,423 $2,904 $519 $4,788 $4,524 $264        Liabilities       Derivatives ($202 )  ($202 ) ($305 )  ($305 ) Total liabilities ($202 )  ($202 ) ($305 )  ($305 ) ##TABLE_ENDMoney market funds, available-for-sale debt investments and equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices or broker/dealer quotes of identical or comparable instruments. Derivatives include foreign currency, commodity and interest rate contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve. Certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following table presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended December 31 due to long-lived asset impairment, and the fair value and asset classification of the related assets as of the impairment date: ##TABLE_START    Fair Value  Total Losses  Fair Value  Total Losses Operating lease equipment $84  ($52 )  $270  ($159 ) Property, plant and equipment  (9 )   (6 ) Other assets and Acquired intangible assets  (10 )   Total $106  ($71 )  $278  ($165 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of the impaired operating lease equipment is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of third party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades and other market factors. Management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued appropriateness and consistency with market trends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected net sales price for the aircraft. Property, plant and equipment and Acquired intangible assets were primarily valued using an income approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. For Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2016 , the following table presents the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques and related unobservable inputs of those assets. ##TABLE_START  Fair Value  Valuation Technique(s)  Unobservable Input  Range Median or Average Operating lease equipment $84  Market approach  Aircraft value publications  $158 - $264 (1) Median $212   Aircraft condition adjustments  ($128) - $0 (2) Net ($128) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  The range represents the sum of the highest and lowest values for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, according to the third party aircraft valuation publications that we use in our valuation process. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The negative amount represents the sum, for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, of all downward adjustments based on consideration of individual aircraft attributes and condition. The positive amount represents the sum of all such upward adjustments. ##TABLE_END Fair Value Disclosures The fair values and related carrying values of financial instruments that are not required to be remeasured at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2016  Carrying Amount  Total Fair Value  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets          Accounts receivable, net $8,832  $8,830    $8,830   Notes receivable, net       Liabilities          Debt, excluding capital lease obligations (9,815 )  (11,209 )    (11,078 )  ($131 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  December 31, 2015  Carrying Amount  Total Fair Value  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets          Accounts receivable, net $8,713  $8,705    $8,705   Notes receivable, net       Liabilities          Debt, excluding capital lease obligations (9,814 )  (11,292 )    (11,123 )  ($169 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of Accounts receivable is based on current market rates for loans of the same risk and maturities. The fair values of notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on current market yields. For our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowing cost derived from dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. The fair values of our debt classified as Level 3 are based on discounted cash flow models using the implied yield from similar securities. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain. Items not included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, Accounts payable and long-term payables. The carrying values of those items, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . The fair value of assets and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1). Note 20  Legal Proceedings Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are pending against us. In addition, we are subject to various U.S. government inquiries and investigations from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, or government dispute and investigation will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Note 21  Segment Information We operate in five principal segments: Commercial Airplanes; Boeing Military Aircraft ( BMA ), Network  Space Systems ( NSS ), and Global Services  Support ( GSS ), collectively Defense, Space  Security ; and Boeing Capital (BCC). All other activities fall within Unallocated items, eliminations and other. See page 54 for the Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note. The Commercial Airplanes segment develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft and provides related support services, principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide. Our BMA segment is engaged in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems for global strike, including fighter aircraft and missile systems; vertical lift including rotorcraft and tilt-rotor aircraft; mobility, surveillance and engagement, including battle management, airborne, anti-submarine, transport and tanker aircraft. Our NSS segment is engaged in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and related services: strategic defense and intelligence systems, including strategic missile and defense systems, command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR), cyber and information solutions, and intelligence systems; satellite systems, including government and commercial satellites and space exploration. Our GSS segment provides customers with mission readiness through total support solutions. Our global services business sustains aircraft and systems with a full spectrum of products and services through integrated logistics, including supply chain management and engineering support; maintenance, modification and upgrades for aircraft; and training systems and government services, including pilot and maintenance training. Our BCC segment facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers. Unallocated items, eliminations and other include common internal services that support Boeings global business operations, as well as technical and functional capabilities, including information technology, research and development, test and evaluation, technology strategy development, environmental remediation management and intellectual property management. It also includes intercompany guarantees provided to BCC and eliminations of certain sales between BCA, BCC and BDS. In November 2016, we announced plans for the formation of Boeing Global Services (BGS), which will bring together certain Commercial Aviation Services businesses, currently included in the Commercial Airplanes segment, and certain BDS businesses (primarily those currently included in the GSS segment). We expect Boeing Global Services to be operational during the second half of 2017. We will continue to report using the existing segment structure until BGS is operational and has discrete financial information that is being provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. While our principal operations are in the United States, Canada and Australia, some key suppliers and subcontractors are located in Europe and Japan. Revenues, including foreign military sales, are reported by customer location and consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Asia, other than China $10,553  $13,433  $11,900 Europe 13,790  12,248  11,898 China 10,312  12,556  11,029 Middle East 13,297  10,846  9,243 Oceania 1,843  2,601  1,757 Canada 2,076  1,870  1,901 Africa 1,999  1,398  2,596 Latin America, Caribbean and other 1,936  1,875  2,596 Total non-U.S. revenues 55,806  56,827  52,920 United States 38,765  39,287  37,842 Total revenues $94,571  $96,114  $90,762 ##TABLE_ENDRevenues from the U.S. government (including foreign military sales through the U.S. government), primarily recorded at BDS, represented 23% , 27% and 30% of consolidated revenues for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Approximately 4% of operating assets were located outside the United States as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 .

For segment reporting purposes, we record Commercial Airplanes segment revenues and cost of sales for airplanes transferred to other segments. Such transfers may include airplanes accounted for as operating leases and considered transferred to the BCC segment and airplanes transferred to the BDS segment for further modification prior to delivery to the customer. The revenues and cost of sales for these transfers are eliminated in the Unallocated items and eliminations caption. For segment reporting purposes, we record BDS revenues and cost of sales for the modification performed on airplanes received from Commercial Airplanes when the airplane is delivered to the customer or at the attainment of performance milestones. Intersegment revenues, eliminated in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, are shown in the following table. ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Commercial Airplanes $2,142  $1,831  $1,822 Boeing Capital   Total $2,158  $1,846  $1,841 ##TABLE_ENDUnallocated Items, Eliminations and other Unallocated items, eliminations and other includes costs not attributable to business segments as well as intercompany profit eliminations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Boeing Company Chicago, Illinois We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 . The financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 8, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP  Chicago, Illinois February 8, 2017  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Boeing Company Chicago, Illinois We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 of the Company and our report dated February 8, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP  Chicago, Illinois February 8, 2017  ", "9A": " Item 9A.

Business The Boeing Company, together with its subsidiaries (herein referred to as Boeing, the Company, we, us, our), is one of the worlds major aerospace firms. We are organized based on the products and services we offer. We operate in four reportable segments: ##TABLE_START  Commercial Airplanes (BCA); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Defense, Space  Security ( BDS ); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Global Services ( BGS ); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Boeing Capital ( BCC ). ##TABLE_ENDCommercial Airplanes Segment This segment develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft and provides fleet support services, principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide. We are a leading producer of commercial aircraft and offer a family of commercial jetliners designed to meet a broad spectrum of global passenger and cargo requirements of airlines. This family of commercial jet aircraft in production includes the 737 narrow-body model and the 747, 767, 777 and 787 wide-body models. Development continues on the 787-10 and certain 737 MAX derivatives and the 777X program. Defense, Space  Security Segment This segment is engaged in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems for global strike, including fighter aircraft and missile systems; vertical lift, including rotorcraft and tilt-rotor aircraft; mobility, surveillance and engagement, including battle management, airborne, anti-submarine, transport and tanker aircraft. In addition, this segment is engaged in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and related services: strategic defense and intelligence systems, including strategic missile and defense systems, command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR), cyber and information solutions, and intelligence systems; satellite systems, including government and commercial satellites and space exploration. BDS' primary customer is the United States Department of Defense ( U.S. DoD ). Revenues from the U.S. DoD, including foreign military sales through the U.S. government, accounted for approximately 79% of its 2017 revenues. Other significant BDS customers include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and customers in international defense, civil and commercial satellite markets. This segment's primary products include the following fixed-wing military aircraft: EA-18G Growler Airborne Electronic Attack, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 Strike Eagle, P-8 programs, and KC-46A Tanker. This segment produces rotorcraft and rotary-wing programs, such as CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, and V-22 Osprey. In addition, this segment's products include space and missile systems including: government and commercial satellites, the International Space Station, missile defense and weapons programs, and Joint Direct Attack Munition, as well as the United Launch Alliance joint venture. Global Services Segment This segment provides services to our commercial and defense customers. This segment offers aviation services support, aircraft modifications, spare parts, training, maintenance documents, data analytics and information-based services, and technical advice to commercial and government customers worldwide. In addition, BGS sustains aircraft and systems with a full spectrum of products and services through integrated logistics, including supply chain management and engineering support; maintenance, modification and upgrades for aircraft; and training systems and government services, including pilot and maintenance training. Major defense programs supported include the C-17 Globemaster III, F-15 Strike Eagle, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, and AH-64 Apache for domestic and international customers. Boeing Capital Segment BCC seeks to ensure that Boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing product and manages overall financing exposure. BCC s portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases, finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and investments. Financial and Other Business Information See the Summary of Business Segment Data and Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information, including revenues and earnings from operations, for each of our business segments. Intellectual Property We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. Non-U.S. Revenues See Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding non-U.S. revenues. Research and Development Research and development (RD) expenditures involve experimentation, design, development and related test activities for defense systems, new and derivative jet aircraft including both commercial and military, advanced space and other company-sponsored product development. RD expenditures are expensed as incurred including amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on U.S. government contracts. Our total research and development expense, net amounted to $3.2 billion , $4.6 billion and $3.3 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Research and development costs also include bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services, as well as costs incurred in excess of amounts estimated to be recoverable under cost-sharing research and development agreements. Bid and proposal costs were $288 million , $311 million and $286 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Employees Total workforce level at December 31, 2017 was approximately 140,800 . As of December 31, 2017 , our principal collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions: ##TABLE_START Union Percent of our Employees Represented Status of the Agreements with Major Union The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) 21% We have two major agreements; one expiring in June 2022 and one in September 2024. The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) 12% We have two major agreements expiring in Octo ber 2022. The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) 1% We have one major agreement expiring in October 2022. ##TABLE_ENDCompetition The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as Airbus, Embraer and Bombardier, and other entrants from Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with greater value products. BDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In addition, certain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2018 . The commercial and defense services market is an extremely challenging landscape made up of many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering products and services which span the life cycle of our defense and commercial airplane programs: training, fleet services and logistics, maintenance and engineering, modifications and upgrades - as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. BGS expects the market to remain highly competitive in 2018, and intends to grow market share by leveraging a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. Regulatory Matters Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets. Government Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default. Commercial Aircraft. In the U.S., our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Outside the U.S., similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Joint Aviation Authorities. Environmental. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations. A Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site for which we were originally assigned a partial share, the statutory framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-U.S. Sales. Our non-U.S. sales are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S. sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks. Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take a year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of companies. Suppliers We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and program/contract profitability, thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. We are also dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices. Seasonality No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report. Our Commercial Airplanes and Global Services businesses depend heavily on commercial airlines, and are subject to unique risks. Market conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological advances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. In addition, availability of financing to non-U.S. customers depends in part on the Export-Import Bank of the United States being fully operational. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally, or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period. We enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers. Our Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards. The commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S. suppliers, highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 787-10, and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy regulatory and customer requirements, and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. We must minimize disruption caused by production changes and achieve productivity improvements in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have plans to adjust production rates on several of our commercial aircraft programs, while at the same time engaging in significant ongoing development and production of the 787-10 and 777X aircraft. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements, and optimizing how we manage inventory. If production rate changes at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and/or the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer. Operational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins. Our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory certifications, could result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support costs. If our commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly and technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues. Changes in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the United States Department of Defense ( U.S. DoD ). Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such as the political environment, U.S. foreign policy, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as authorization and appropriations bills. In addition, significant budgetary delays and constraints have already resulted in reduced spending levels, and additional reductions may be forthcoming. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (The Act) established limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending between the 2012 and 2021 U.S. government fiscal years. Accordingly, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to pressure. In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies (including NASA) within the overall budgetary framework described above. While the House and Senate Appropriations committees included funding for Boeings major programs, such as F/A-18, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, KC-46A Tanker and P-8 programs, in the final FY2017 appropriation and in their FY2018 bills, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in FY2018 and beyond will affect Boeings programs. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorizations and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. In addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both U.S. defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment, we expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. If we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition priorities and/or fail to meet affordability targets set by the U.S. DoD customer, our revenues and market share would be further impacted. We conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks. In 2017 ,  31% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign military sales (FMS) through the U.S. government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks. Our sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs. New procurement regulations, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our compliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS and BGS businesses. These requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could be subject to additional costs in the form of withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply with these requirements in the future. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as continuing resolutions rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position. We are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S. government contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, routinely audit government contractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false. We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns. Our BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 65% and 77% of their 2017 revenues from fixed-price contracts. While fixed-price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. For example, during 2017, we recorded reach-forward losses totaling $471 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract, primarily driven by additional costs attributable to certification and incorporating changes into low rate initial production (LRIP) aircraft. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance. Fixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker , and commercial and military satellites. We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks. Our BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 35% and 23% of their 2017 revenues from cost-type contracting arrangements. Some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Programs whose contracts are primarily cost-type include GMD , Proprietary and SLS programs. We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks. Contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit payments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite does not perform to specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance. The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees we ultimately expect to realize is recognized as revenue in the construction period. If the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criteria, customers will not be obligated to continue making in-orbit payments and/or we may be required to provide refunds to the customer and incur significant charges. Our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance and financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components. We rely on other companies including U.S. and non-U.S. subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies, and production commodities and to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences financial difficulties, delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers or incur additional costs. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum, titanium or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the suppliers control, such as geo-political developments, or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs. We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results. Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. With respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling and other non-recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes to price escalation indices, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer and supplier negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact these estimates. Any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under Managements Discussion and Analysis  Critical Accounting Policies  Contract Accounting/Program Accounting on pages 41  43 and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 52  64 of this Form 10-K. Competition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell may reduce our future contracts and sales. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasing competition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers of commercial jet aircraft. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation, fewer large and new programs and new priorities, including near and long-term cost competitiveness, of our U.S. DoD and non-U.S. will intensify competition for many of our BDS products. Our BGS segment faces competition from many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not result in reduced revenues and market share. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries. In 2017 , non-U.S. customers, which includes FMS, accounted for approximately 55% of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including: ##TABLE_START  changes in regulatory requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  U.S. and non-U.S. government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  fluctuations in international currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  volatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  imposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with a variety of non-U.S. laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international tensions and conflicts. ##TABLE_END While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future. Unauthorized access to our or our customers information and systems could negatively impact our business. We face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address these threats. While these measures are designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems, certain types of attacks, including cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information and information technology systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we cannot prevent the unauthorized access, release and/or corruption of our customers confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or we could face financial losses. The outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. We are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits, or future lawsuits, could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the United States and its various states, as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S. government, the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our current or past ownership of certain property. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks. A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft, and among customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position could be materially adversely affected. We may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , our airplane financing commitments totaled $10,221 million and $14,847 million . If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures. As part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful. We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures. We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. We maintain insurance for certain risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. government. The amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft technologies, missile systems, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims or liabilities. Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses. Our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. Any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of our data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and of our products and services. Some of our and our suppliers workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages. Approximately 52,000 employees, which constitute 37% of our total workforce, were union represented as of December 31, 2017 . We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BDS program production. We may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 10 U.S. labor organizations and 7 non-U.S. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions requirements without impacting our financial condition. The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations. Substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders equity and cash flows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods. The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and discretionary contributions to improve the plans ' funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions  could have a significant effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders ' equity. For U.S. government contracts, we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. We also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the level of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see  Management ' s Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies - Pension Plans  on page 43 of this Form 10-K. Although GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement benefit contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. We are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or past manufacturing operations or the operations of companies we have acquired. In other cases, we may become subject to such costs due to an indemnification agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental liabilities. In addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation requirements could result in additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in the design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in an expanding number of countries and rely on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors. Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses  Commercial Airplanes ( BCA ), Defense, Space  Security ( BDS ), and Global Services ( BGS )  supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital ( BCC ). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands, and continue to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality to provide a fair return for our shareholders. BCA is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. BGS provides support for commercial, defense and space customers through innovative, comprehensive, and cost-competitive product and service solutions. Our strategy also benefits us as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets sometimes offset. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers. Consolidated Results of Operations  The following table summarizes key indicators of consolidated results of operations: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except per share data)      Years ended December 31,   Revenues $93,392  $94,571  $96,114       GAAP      Earnings from operations 10,278  5,834  7,443 Operating margins 11.0 %  6.2 %  7.7 % Effective income tax rate 18.4 %  12.1 %  27.7 % Net earnings $8,197  $4,895  $5,176 Diluted earnings per share $13.43  $7.61  $7.44       Non-GAAP (1)      Core operating earnings $8,970  $5,464  $7,741 Core operating margins 9.6 %  5.8 %  8.1 % Core earnings per share $12.04  $7.24  $7.72 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) These measures exclude certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense.

BCA revenues decreased by $1,283 million or 2% primarily due to delivery mix, with fewer twin aisle deliveries more than offsetting the impact of higher single aisle deliveries. BDS revenues decreased by $1,506 million primarily due to fewer C-17 deliveries, l ower milestone revenue on satellite programs, and the mix of deliveries on the Apache and F-15 programs, partially offset by higher volume on various weapons programs. The decreases at BCA and BDS were partially offset by higher unallocated revenue and higher BGS revenue, primarily due to higher commercial parts revenue. Revenues in 2016 decreased by $1,543 million or 2% compared with 2015. BCA revenues decreased by $1,387 million or 2% due fewer deliveries. BDS revenues decreased by $1,145 million or 5% primarily due to lower milestone revenue on government satellite programs,  fewer C-17 deliveries, lower Commercial Crew revenue, as well as timing and mix of CH-47 Chinook deliveries, partially offset by higher revenue on several modifications and upgrades programs. The decreases at BCA and BDS were partially offset by higher BGS revenue, primarily due to higher commercial parts revenue and government services revenue. The changes in unallocated items, eliminations and other in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 primarily reflect the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries and the sale of aircraft previously leased to customers. Earnings From Operations  The following table summarizes Earnings from operations: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Commercial Airplanes $5,432  $1,995  $4,284 Defense, Space  Security 2,223  1,966  2,312 Global Services 2,256  2,177  1,835 Boeing Capital   Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit income/(expense) 1,308   (298 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations (1,055 )  (733 )  (740 ) Earnings from operations (GAAP) $10,278  $5,834  $7,443 Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit (1,308 )  (370 )  Core operating earnings (Non-GAAP) $8,970  $5,464  $7,741 ##TABLE_ENDEarnings from operations in 2017  increased by $4,444 million compared with 2016 , primarily due to higher earnings at BCA and BDS, and higher unallocated pension income, which more than offset other unallocated items and eliminations. BCA's 2017 earnings increased by $3,437 million primarily reflecting lower reach-forward losses, lower research and development costs, and improved margins reflecting favorable cost performance, which more than offset the impact of lower revenues. In 2016, BCA recorded reach-forward losses of $1,258 million on the 747 program and reclassified $1,235 million of 787 flight test aircraft inventory costs to research and development expense. BDS earnings from operations in 2017  increased by $257 million compared with 2016 primarily due to lower charges on the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew programs, which more than offset the impact of fewer C-17 deliveries and Apache delivery mix. Earnings from operations in 2016 decreased by $1,609 million compared with 2015 due to lower earnings at BCA, partially offset by the change in unallocated pension and postretirement income/(expense). BCA earnings in 2016 decreased by $2,289 million primarily due to the reclassification of $1,235 million of 787 flight test aircraft costs to research and development and higher reach-forward losses on the 747 and KC-46A Tanker programs. The reclassification of flight test aircraft costs was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of our determination that two 787 flight test aircraft were no longer commercially saleable. The change in the unallocated pension and postretirement income/(expense) in 2016 was primarily driven by lower service costs and lower amortization of actuarial losses. During 2017, 2016 and 2015 , we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker program. In 2017 , we recorded charges of $471 million , of which $378 million was recorded at BCA and $93 million at BDS . During 2016 , we recorded charges of $1,128 million : $772 million at BCA and $356 million at BDS. During 2015 , we recorded charges of $835 million : $513 million at BCA and $322 million at BDS. During 2016 and 2015 we recorded reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258 million and $885 million. Core operating earnings for 2017  increased by $3,506 million compared with 2016 primarily due to lower reach forward losses and the reclassification of costs related to the 787 flight test aircraft in 2016. Core operating earnings in 2016 decreased by $2,227 million compared with 2015 primarily due to the reclassification of costs related to the 787 flight test aircraft and higher charges on the 747 and KC-46A Tanker programs described above. Unallocated Items, Eliminations and Other The most significant items included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other are shown in the following table: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Share-based plans ($77 )  ($66 )  ($76 ) Deferred compensation (240 )  (46 )  (63 ) Eliminations and other (738 )  (621 )  (601 ) Sub-total (included in core operating earnings*) (1,055 )  (733 )  (740 ) Pension 1,120   (421 ) Postretirement   Pension and other postretirement benefit income/(expense) (excluded from core operating earnings*) 1,308   (298 ) Total unallocated items, eliminations and other $253  ($363 )  ($1,038 ) ##TABLE_END* Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense. See pages 39 - 40 . Deferred compensation expense increased by $194 million in 2017 and decreased by $17 million in 2016, primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions and our stock price. Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $117 million in 2017 and increased by $20 million in 2016 primarily due to the timing of the elimination of profit on intercompany aircraft deliveries and expense allocations. Net periodic benefit cost related to pension totaled $312 million , $523 million and $2,786 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The components of net periodic benefit cost are shown in the following table: ##TABLE_START  Pension Years ended December 31,   Service cost $402  $604  $1,764 Interest cost 2,991  3,050  2,990 Expected return on plan assets (3,847 )  (3,999 )  (4,031 ) Amortization of prior service costs (39 )   Recognized net actuarial loss   1,577 Settlement/curtailment/other losses   Net periodic benefit cost $312  $523  $2,786 ##TABLE_ENDThe decreases in net periodic pension benefit costs of $211 million in 2017 and of $2,263 million in 2016 are primarily due to lower service costs reflecting the transition of employees in 2016 to defined contribution retirement savings plans. The decrease in 2016 costs is also due to lower amortization of actuarial losses which reflects actuarial gains in 2015 resulting from the year-end discount rate increase from 3.9% to 4.2%. A portion of net periodic benefit cost is recognized in Earnings from operations in the period incurred and the remainder is included in inventory at the end of the reporting period and recorded in Earnings from operations in subsequent periods. Costs are allocated to the business segments as described in Note 21 . Net periodic benefit costs included in Earnings from operations were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Pension Years ended December 31,   Allocated to business segments ($1,759 )  ($2,196 )  ($1,945 ) Unallocated items, eliminations and other 1,120   (421 ) Total ($639 )  ($1,979 )  ($2,366 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe unallocated pension costs recognized in earnings in 2017 was a benefit of $1,120 million compared with $217 million in 2016 . The higher unallocated pension benefit recognized in earnings in 2017 primarily reflects the amortization of pension benefits capitalized as inventory in prior years. The unallocated pension costs recognized in earnings in 2016 was a benefit of $217 million compared with expense of $ 421 million in 2015. The 2016 benefit reflects the difference between the higher segment allocation compared to the U.S. GAAP net periodic pension costs recognized in earnings in the current period. Other Earnings Items ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Earnings from operations $10,278  $5,834  $7,443 Other income/(loss), net   (13 ) Interest and debt expense (360 )  (306 )  (275 ) Earnings before income taxes 10,047  5,568  7,155 Income tax expense (1,850 )  (673 )  (1,979 ) Net earnings from continuing operations $8,197  $4,895  $5,176 ##TABLE_ENDOther income, net increased by $89 million and $53 million in 2017 and 2016 , primarily due to higher gains from foreign exchange and interest income. Interest and debt expense increased by $54 million in 2017 as a result of lower capitalized interest and increased by $31 million in 2016 as a result of higher average debt balances. Our effective income tax rates were 18.4% , 12.1% and 27.7% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in December 2017, reduced the 2017 effective tax rate by 10.5% and resulted in incremental tax benefits of $1,051 million , primarily related to the remeasurement of our U.S. net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Our 2016 effective tax rate was lower than the 2015 rate primarily due to lower pre-tax income in 2016 and discrete tax benefits of $617 million recorded in the third quarter of 2016 related to tax basis adjustments and the settlement of the 2011-2012 federal tax audit. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Total Costs and Expenses (Cost of Sales) Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales, BDS predominantly uses contract accounting and BGS uses contract accounting for defense contracts. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. Under contract accounting, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. The following table summarizes cost of sales: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,  Change   Change Cost of sales $76,066  $80,790 ($4,724 )  $80,790  $82,088 ($1,298 ) Cost of sales as a % of revenues 81.4 %  85.4 % (4.0 %)  85.4 %  85.4 % 0.0 % ##TABLE_ENDCost of sales in 2017 decreased by $4,724 million , or 6% , compared with 2016 , primarily due to lower reach-forward losses, delivery model mix at BCA and improved performance at BCA and BDS. Cost of sales in 2016 decreased by $1,298 million , or 2%, compared with 2015, primarily due to lower volume across all segments, partially offset by the 747 reach-forward losses at BCA. Research and Development The following table summarizes our Research and development expense: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Commercial Airplanes $2,247  $3,706  $2,311 Defense, Space  Security   Global Services   Other (42 )  (47 )  Total $3,179  $4,627  $3,331 ##TABLE_ENDResearch and development expense in 2017  decreased by $1,448 million compared with 2016 primarily due to the reclassification of $1,235 million of costs from inventory in the second quarter of 2016 related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft as well as lower spending on the 737 MAX, 787-10, and 777X. Research and development expense in 2016 increased by $1,296 million compared with 2015 primarily due to the reclassification of $1,235 million of costs from inventory in the second quarter of 2016 related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft and higher spending on the 777X. Backlog Our backlog at December 31 was as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Commercial Airplanes $421,345  $413,036  $429,346 Defense, Space  Security 49,577  44,825  46,933 Global Services 17,223  15,631  13,020 Total Backlog $488,145  $473,492  $489,299       Contractual backlog 470,241  458,277  476,595 Unobligated backlog 17,904  $15,215  $12,704 Total Backlog $488,145  $473,492  $489,299 ##TABLE_ENDContractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog during 2017 was primarily due to orders and funding in excess of deliveries. The decrease in contractual backlog during 2016 was primarily due to deliveries in excess of net orders. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The increase in unobligated backlog in 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to contract awards, partially offset by reclassifications to contractual backlog related to BDS and BGS contracts. Additional Considerations KC-46A Tanker In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force ( USAF ) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. In 2015, we began work on low rate initial production (LRIP) aircraft for the USAF. During the third quarter of 2016, following our achievement of key flight testing milestones, the USAF authorized two LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at $2.8 billion. On January 27, 2017, the USAF authorized an additional LRIP lot for 15 aircraft valued at $2.1 billion. The contract contains production options for both LRIP aircraft and full rate production aircraft. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. The EMD contract is currently in the certification and flight testing phases and we expect 18 fully operational aircraft to be delivered in 2018. During 2016 and 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,128 million and $835 million related to the EMD contract and LRIP aircraft. During 2017, we recorded further reach-forward losses of $471 million primarily reflecting higher estimated costs associated with certification and incorporating changes into LRIP aircraft. As with any development program, this program remains subject to additional reach-forward losses or delivery delays if we experience further production, technical or quality issues, delays in certification and/or flight testing. Export-Import Bank of the United States Many of our non-U.S. customers finance purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the banks charter on June 30, 2015, the banks charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the banks board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. Certain of our non-U.S. customers also may seek to delay purchases if they cannot obtain financing at reasonable costs, and there may be further impacts with respect to future sales campaigns involving non-U.S. customers. We continue to work with our customers to mitigate risks associated with the lack of a quorum of the banks board of directors and assist with alternative third party financing sources. Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment Global economic growth, a primary driver for air travel, has returned to the long-term average of approximately 3%. Passenger traffic in 2017 is estimated to grow by more than 7%, exceeding the long-term trend of approximately 5%. While growth was strong across all major world regions, there continues to be variation between regions and airline business models. Airlines operating in the Asia Pacific regions and Europe, as well as low-cost-carriers globally, are currently leading the growth in passenger traffic. Air cargo traffic growth, building on the recovery that started in 2016, is expected to exceed 9% in 2017, driven by strong trade and industrial production in all regions. Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also focusing on reducing costs and renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airplanes. Net profits in 2017 are expected to approximate $35 billion, consistent with 2016. The long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast projects a long-term average growth rate of 4.7% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.8% average annual GDP growth, we project a $6.1 trillion market for approximately 41,030 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global environmental regulations. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Market liberalization in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is enabling low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 91% of Commercial Airplanes total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier continue to develop and market larger and increasingly more capable airplanes, including Embraers E-195 in the regional jet market and Bombardiers C Series in the 100-150 seat transcontinental market. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft. Some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including launch aid, which greatly reduces the cost and commercial risks associated with airplane development activities. This has enabled the development of airplanes without commercial viability; others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible; and many offered for sale below market-based prices. Many competitors have continued to make improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share and improving earnings. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. We are focused on improving our products and services and continuing our cost-reduction efforts, which enhances our ability to compete. We are also focused on taking actions to ensure that Boeing is not harmed by unfair subsidization of competitors. Results of Operations  ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Revenues $56,729  $58,012  $59,399 % of total company revenues %  %  % Earnings from operations $5,432  $1,995  $4,284 Operating margins 9.6 %  3.4 %  7.2 % Research and development $2,247  $3,706  $2,311 ##TABLE_ENDRevenues  Commercial Airplanes revenues decreased by $1,283 million or 2% in 2017 compared with 2016 due to delivery mix, with fewer twin aisle deliveries more than offsetting the impact of higher single aisle deliveries. Commercial Airplanes revenues decreased by $1,387 million or 2% in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to fewer deliveries. Commercial Airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  *    Total           Cumulative deliveries 6,732  1,542  1,106  1,534   Deliveries (17)  (1)    763           Cumulative deliveries 6,203  1,528  1,096  1,460   Deliveries (19)  (3)    748           Cumulative deliveries 5,713  1,519  1,083  1,361   Deliveries (15)  (3)    762 ##TABLE_END* Intercompany deliveries identified by parentheses  Aircraft accounted for as revenues by BCA and as operating leases in consolidation identified by parentheses Earnings From Operations  Earnings from operations in 2017  increased by $3,437 million compared with 2016 . The increase in earnings and operating margins is primarily due to lower reach-forward losses, lower research and development costs and improved margins reflecting favorable cost performance, which more than offset the impact of lower revenues. Earnings from operations in 2016 decreased by $2,289 million compared with 2015. The decrease in earnings and operating margins is primarily due to higher research and development costs of $1,395 million , delivery mix and higher reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258 million compared with $885 million in 2015. Research and development expense in 2016 reflect the reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of $1,235 million related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft and higher planned spending related to the 777X program. Reach-forward losses of $378 million , $772 million and $513 million were recorded related to the KC-46A Tanker in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2016 and 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258 million and $885 million. Backlog  Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm backlog excludes options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers. BCA total backlog was $421,345 million , $413,036 million and $429,346 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to net orders in excess of deliveries. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to deliveries in excess of net orders. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a programs life. Estimation of each programs accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. ##TABLE_START  Program   747*    777X  2017            Program accounting quantities 9,800  1,570  1,171  1,625  **  1,400 Undelivered units under firm orders 4,668      Cumulative firm orders 11,400  1,554  1,204  1,636   1,294            Program accounting quantities 9,000  1,555  1,159  1,625  **  1,300 Undelivered units under firm orders 4,452      Cumulative firm orders 10,655  1,556  1,189  1,596   1,200            Program accounting quantities 8,400  1,574  1,147  1,650  **  1,300 Undelivered units under firm orders 4,392      Cumulative firm orders 10,105  1,539  1,163  1,579   1,142 ##TABLE_END* At December 31, 2017 , the 747 accounting quantity includes one already completed aircraft which is being remarketed. ** The accounting quantity for the 777X will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020. Program Highlights 737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 800 units during 2017 due to the program  s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 47 per month and plan to increase to 52 per month in 2018. We plan to further increase the rate to 57 per month in 2019. We delivered the first 737 MAX 8 in May 2017 and announced the launch of the 737 MAX 10 in June 2017. 747 Program During the fourth quarter of 2017, we received firm orders and commitments for 15 aircraft and we increased the program accounting quantity by 15 aircraft. The program accounting quantity now includes aircraft scheduled to be produced through 2021. We are currently producing at a rate of 0.5 aircraft per month, having reduced the rate from 1.0 per month in September 2016. In 2016 and 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,258 million and $885 million as lower than expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower-than-expected growth of global freight traffic resulted in lower anticipated revenues from future sales and higher costs to produce fewer airplanes. We continue to evaluate the viability of the 747 program and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747. 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 12 units during the third quarter of 2017 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. The combined tanker and commercial production rate increased from 2 per month to 2.5 per month in the third quarter of 2017. 777 Program We implemented a planned production rate decrease from 8.3 per month to 7 per month during the first quarter of 2017. We further reduced the rate to 5 per month in the third quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we launched the 777X, which features a new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips. The 777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020. 787 Program The accounting quantity for the 787 program increased by 100 units during the third quarter of 2017 due to the programs normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 12 per month and plan to increase to 14 per month in 2019. First delivery of the 787-10 derivative aircraft is targeted for 2018. Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1.0% of total consolidated costs of products and services. Program Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. ##TABLE_START Go-ahead and Initial Delivery                  737 MAX 7                      737 MAX 8                      737 MAX 9                      737 MAX 10                      787-10                      777X                      ##TABLE_ENDReflects models in development during 2017 We launched the 737 MAX 7, 8, 9 in August 2011 and the 737 MAX 10 in June 2017. We launched the 787-10 in June 2013 and the 777X in November 2013. Additional Considerations The development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 787-10 and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Defense, Space  Security  Business Environment and Trends United States Government Defense Environment Overview In November 2017, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 (FY2018), which authorizes a U.S. DoD budget topline higher than the administrations budget request from May. While the appropriations process for FY2018 remains incomplete, both the House and Senate appropriations committees have also produced bills that increase the U.S. DoD budget topline above the administrations request . On February 9, 2018, Congress passed a fifth Continuing Resolution that maintains current funding levels through March 23, 2018 and includes increases to the Budget Control Act caps for defense and non-defense spending for FY2018 and FY2019. However, the Budget Control Act continues to mandate limits on U.S. government discretionary spending and remains in effect. As a result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts will remain unless Congress acts to repeal or suspend this law.  Funding timeliness also remains a risk. If Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills or an omnibus spending bill before the expiration of the current Continuing Resolution, a government shutdown could result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts or program-level appropriations. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. DoD, the Department of Transportation, or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders.  In addition, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows.   Non-U.S. Defense Environment Overview The non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given the diverse regional threats. At the end of 2017, 40% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-US customers. Results of Operations ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Revenues $21,057  $22,563  $23,708 % of total company revenues %  %  % Earnings from operations $2,223  $1,966  $2,312 Operating margins 10.6 %  8.7 %  9.8 % ##TABLE_ENDSince our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues, earnings and backlog may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Deliveries of units for new-build production aircraft, including remanufactures and modifications were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   F/A-18 Models   F-15 Models   C-17 Globemaster III   CH-47 Chinook (New)   CH-47 Chinook (Renewed)   AH-64 Apache (New)   AH-64 Apache (Remanufactured)   P-8 Models   AEWC   C-40A   Total   ##TABLE_ENDNew-build satellite deliveries were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Commercial and civil satellites   Military satellites   ##TABLE_ENDRevenues  BDS revenues in 2017  decreased by $1,506 million compared with 2016 primarily due to fewer C-17 deliveries, lower milestone revenue on satellite programs, and the mix of deliveries on the Apache and F-15 programs, partially offset by higher volume on various weapons programs. BDS revenues in 2016 decreased by $1,145 million compared with 2015 primarily due to lower milestone revenue on government satellite programs, fewer C-17 deliveries, lower Commercial Crew revenue, as well as timing and mix of CH-47 Chinook deliveries, partially offset by higher revenue on several modifications and upgrades programs. Earnings From Operations  BDS earnings from operations in 2017  increased by $257 million compared with 2016 primarily due to lower charges on the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew programs, which more than offset the impact of fewer C-17 deliveries and Apache delivery mix. Higher earnings reflect the favorable impact of cumulative catch-up adjustments which were $541 million higher in 2017 than in 2016 , primarily driven by lower charges. BDS earnings from operations in 2016 decreased by $346 million compared with 2015, primarily due to lower earnings on the Commercial Crew program, driven by a charge of $162 million during the third quarter of 2016, as well as lower volume and mix on the CH-47 Chinook program. Lower earnings include the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments which were $441 million higher than 2015, primarily due to Commercial Crew charges in 2016 and the absence of favorable F-15 program adjustments recorded in 2015. BDS earnings from operations include equity earnings of $183 million , $249 million and $202 million primarily from our ULA joint venture in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . During 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , BDS recorded charges related to the KC-46A Tanker contract of $93 million , $356 million and $322 million . Backlog Total backlog of $49,577 million at December 31, 2017  increase d by 11% from December 31, 2016 , primarily due to current year contract awards for the F-15 and Apache programs, partially offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years. Total backlog of $44,825 million at December 31, 2016 decreased by 4% reflecting revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by current year contract awards for satellite, P-8, weapons, Apache and CH-47 Chinook programs. Additional Considerations Our BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense , Proprietary and Space Launch System programs. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, and commercial and military satellites. KC-46A Tanker See the discussion of the USAF KC-46A Tanker program on page 23 . United Launch Alliance See the discussion of Indemnifications to ULA and Financing Commitments in Notes 6 , 11 , and 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Global Services Business Environment and Trends The aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics, and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering, and upgrades; training and professional services; and information services. We expect the market to grow by around 3.5% annually. As the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services designed to increase efficiency and extend the economic lives of airplanes. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve their productivity and efficiency. Airlines continue to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inventory, frequently outsourcing spares management to third parties. Government services market segments are growing on pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S. government services market is the single largest individual market, comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Over the next decade, we expect U.S. growth to remain flat and non-U.S. fleets, led by Middle East and Asia Pacific customers, to add rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft at the fastest rates. We expect less than 20 percent of the worldwide fleet of military aircraft to be retired and replaced over the next ten years, driving increased demand for services to maintain aging aircraft and enhance aircraft capability. BGS major customer, the U.S. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty described on page 29 , which could restrict the execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions. Industry Competitiveness Aviation services is a competitive market with many domestic and international competitors. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales growth potential and long-term investment returns.

Backlog BGS total backlog of $17,223 million at December 31, 2017 increased by 10% from December 31, 2016 , primarily due to current year contract awards including F-15, C-17, and Apache support programs. BGS total backlog of $15,631 million at December 31, 2016 increased by 20% from December 31, 2015 primarily due to current year contract awards including the C-17 support program. Boeing Capital Business Environment and Trends BCCs gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 totaled $3,006 million . A substantial portion of BCCs portfolio is related to customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BCCs portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft. BCC provided customer financing of $480 million and $1,376 million during 2017 and 2016 . While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2018 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources. However, a number of factors could cause BCCs new business volume to increase further, including if the Export-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not, approve new financing transactions. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,000 western-built commercial jet aircraft ( 8.3% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2017 , including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 2% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2016 and 2015 , 8.8% and 9.5% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service.

BCC s revenues in 2017 were consistent with 2016 . BCC s revenues in 2016 decreased by $115 million compared with 2015 primarily due to lower lease income, and lower end of lease settlement payments. Earnings From Operations  BCCs earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $55 million primarily due to lower asset impairment and depreciation expenses. Earnings from operations in 2016 increased by $9 million primarily due to lower asset impairment expense which more than offset lower revenues. Financial Position The following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Customer financing and investment portfolio, net $3,003  $4,109 Other assets, primarily cash and short-term investments  Total assets $3,680  $4,455     Other liabilities, primarily deferred income taxes $653  $1,007 Debt, including intercompany loans 2,523  2,864 Equity  Total liabilities and equity $3,680  $4,455     Debt-to-equity ratio 5.0-to-1  4.9-to-1 ##TABLE_ENDBCC s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2017  decreased from December 31, 2016 , primarily due to $1,434 million of asset sales, note payoffs, and portfolio run-off, partially offset by new volume. Aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $25 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2018 . We are seeking to remarket these aircraft or have the leases extended. BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment.

The increase of $2.8 billion in 2017 was primarily driven by higher advances more than offsetting inventory increases. The increase of $1.1 billion in 2016 was primarily due to lower expenditures on commercial airplane program inventory, primarily 787. Advances and progress billings increase d by $4.6 billion in 2017 , decrease d by $1.9 billion in 2016 and increase d by $0.4 billion in 2015 . During 2017, our discretionary contributions to our pension plans included 14.4 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $3.5 billion and $ 0.5 billion in cash. Discretionary contributions to our pension plans were insignificant in 2016 and 2015 . Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities during 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $2.1 billion , $3.4 billion and $1.8 billion . Capital expenditures totaled $1.7 billion in 2017 , down from $2.6 billion in 2016 and $2.5 billion in 2015 . We expect capital expenditures in 2018 to be higher than 2017 . Net proceeds from investments was insignificant in 2017. Net contributions to investments were $0.5 billion in 2016 compared with net proceeds from investments of $0.6 billion in 2015. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $11.4 billion during 2017 , an increase of $1.8 billion compared with 2016 , primarily due to higher share repurchases and dividend payments. During 2017 , our net borrowings were $1.1 billion compared with minimal net repayments in 2016 . Cash used by financing activities was $9.6 billion during 2016, an increase of $1.7 billion compared with 2015 , primarily due to lower net borrowings and higher dividend payments and share repurchases. At December 31, 2017 and 2016 the recorded balance of debt was $11.1 billion and $10.0 billion of which $1.3 billion and $0.4 billion was classified as short-term. At December 31, 2017 and 2016 this included $2.5 billion and $2.9 billion of debt attributable to BCC , of which $0.9 billion and $0.1 billion were classified as short-term. During 2017 and 2016 we repurchased 46.1 million and 55.1 million shares totaling $9.2 billion and $7.0 billion through our open market share repurchase program. In 2017 and 2016 , we had 0.7 million shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At December 31, 2017 , the amount available under the share repurchase plan, announced on December 11, 2017 , totaled $18 billion . Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that serves as a source of short-term liquidity. At December 31, 2017 , commercial paper borrowings totaling $600 million were supported by unused commitments under the revolving credit agreement. We had no commercial paper borrowings in 2016. Currently, we have $5.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. Financing commitments totaled $10.2 billion and $14.8 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016 . We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In addition, many of our non-U.S. customers finance aircraft purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the banks charter on June 30, 2015, the banks charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the banks board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities. At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , our pension plans were $16.4 billion and $20.1 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2017 with minimal required contributions in 2018 . During 2017, we contributed shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $3.5 billion and $ 0.5 billion in cash. We do not expect to make contributions to our pension plans in 2018 . We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years. At December 31, 2017 , we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2017 , and the estimated timing thereof. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Total  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  3-5 years  After 5 years Long-term debt (including current portion) $11,130  $1,285  $2,362  $1,266  $6,217 Interest on debt 5,635     3,654 Pension and other postretirement cash requirements 6,190   1,245  1,246  3,090 Capital lease obligations     Operating lease obligations 1,367     Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position 115,064  48,375  31,369  23,223  12,097 Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position 18,630  18,289    Total contractual obligations (1) $158,163  $69,311  $36,558  $26,637  $25,657 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Excludes income tax matters. As of December 31, 2017 , our net liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions of $1,736 million , was $1,634 million . For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. ##TABLE_END Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, customer financing equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation. Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology or skills transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2017 , we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2017 , we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $17.9 billion that extend through 2030 . Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2017 . ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Total Amounts Committed/Maximum Amount of Loss  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  4-5 years  After 5 years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $3,708  $1,659  $782  $559  $708 Commercial aircraft financing commitments 10,221  2,047  4,372  2,256  1,546 Total commercial commitments $13,929  $3,706  $5,154  $2,815  $2,254 ##TABLE_ENDCommercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect to delivered aircraft, based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required, particularly if the Export-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not, provide new financing support. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contingent Obligations We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $524 million at December 31, 2017 . For additional information, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-GAAP Measures Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the impact of certain pension and other postretirement benefit expenses that are not allocated to business segments. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to BCA and certain BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. The unallocated pension costs recognized in earnings during 2017 was a benefit of $1,120 million compared with a benefit of $217 million in 2016 and an expense of $421 million in 2015 . The higher 2017 benefit reflects the amortization of pension benefits capitalized as inventory in prior years. The 2016 benefit reflects the difference between the higher segment allocation compared to the U.S. GAAP net periodic pension costs recognized in earnings in the current period, as well as lower settlements and curtailments. For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see the Managements Discussion and Analysis on pages 20 and 21 of this Form 10-K and see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts. Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures The table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of earnings from operations, operating margins and diluted earnings per share. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except per share data)    Years ended December 31,   Revenues $93,392  $94,571  $96,114 Earnings from operations, as reported $10,278  $5,834  $7,443 Operating margins 11.0 %  6.2 %  7.7 %       Unallocated pension (income)/expense ($1,120 )  ($217 )  $421 Unallocated other postretirement benefit income ($188 )  ($153 )  ($123 ) Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit (income)/expense ($1,308 )  ($370 )  $298 Core operating earnings (non-GAAP) $8,970  $5,464  $7,741 Core operating margins (non-GAAP) 9.6 %  5.8 %  8.1 %       Diluted earnings per share, as reported $13.43  $7.61  $7.44 Unallocated pension (income)/expense ($1.83 )  ($0.33 )  $0.61 Unallocated other postretirement benefit income ($0.31 )  ($0.24 )  ($0.18 ) Provision for deferred income taxes on adjustments (1) $0.75  $0.20  ($0.15 ) Core earnings per share (non-GAAP) $12.04  $7.24  $7.72       Weighted average diluted shares (in millions) 610.7  643.8  696.1 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The income tax impact is calculated using the tax rate in effect for the non-GAAP adjustments. ##TABLE_ENDCritical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting Contract accounting is used to determine revenue, cost of sales, and profit predominantly by BDS and for defense contracts at BGS. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contracts inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2017 net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts increased Earnings from operations by $14 million . For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts decreased Earnings from operations by $912 million and $224 million . Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS and defense contracts at BGS for all of 2017 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $280 million . In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. For example, in 2016 and 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,258 million and $885 million on the 747 program. We continue to evaluate the viability of the 747 program and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 and 777X programs, typically have lower initial margins than established programs. In addition, actual costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity are included within program inventory as deferred production costs. Deferred production, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements are realized. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins. If the combined gross margin percentages for our commercial airplane programs had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would have a similar effect on the Commercial Airplane segments operating margins. For the year ended December 31, 2017 , a 1% increase or decrease in operating margins for our Commercial Airplane segment would have a $567 million impact on operating earnings. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any. We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2017 and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill. As a result of the change in our reportable segments, as described in Note 21 , we reallocated goodwill to our new reporting units using a relative fair value approach. We evaluated goodwill for impairment at July 1, 2017 and determined that no impairment existed. As of December 31, 2017 , we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had $490 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets. Pension Plans The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders equity. The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2017 . ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Change in discount rate Increase 25 bps  Change in discount rate Decrease 25 bps Pension plans    Projected benefit obligation ($2,364 )  $2,961 Net periodic pension cost (84 )  ##TABLE_ENDPension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2017 net periodic pension expense by $148 million . We expect 2018 net periodic pension cost to decrease by approximately $44 million and the portion recognized in earnings before income taxes to decrease by approximately $512 million primarily due to lower amortization of actuarial losses. ", "7A": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2017 , the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2017 , a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $289 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. ", "8": " Item 8.

The Boeing Company and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015  (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as Boeing, the Company, we, us, or our). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As described in Note 21 , effective July 1, 2017, we now operate in four reportable segments: Commercial Airplanes (BCA); Defense, Space  Security (BDS), Global Services (BGS), and Boeing Capital (BCC). Amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Use of Estimates Management makes assumptions and estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Those assumptions and estimates directly affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant estimates for which changes in the near term are considered reasonably possible and that may have a material impact on the financial statements are disclosed in these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Cycle For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year . Revenue and Related Cost Recognition Contract Accounting Contract accounting is used for development and production activities predominantly by BDS and for defense contracts at BGS. The majority of these activities are performed under contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that extend over several years. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales and costs for each contract resulting in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. When the current estimates of total sales and costs for a contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contracts percent complete. Net cumulative catch-up adjustments to prior years earnings, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Increase/(decrease) to Earnings from Operations $14  ($912 )  ($224 ) Increase/(decrease) to Diluted EPS $0.02  ($1.25 )  ($0.23 ) ##TABLE_ENDSignificant adjustments during the three years ended December 31, 2017 included reach-forward losses of $471 , $1,128 and $835 on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract recorded during 2017, 2016 and 2015. We combine contracts for accounting purposes when they are negotiated as a package with an overall profit margin objective. These essentially represent an agreement to do a single project for a single customer, involve interrelated construction activities with substantial common costs, and are performed concurrently or sequentially. When a group of contracts is combined, revenue and profit are earned uniformly over the performance of the combined contracts. Similarly, we may segment a single contract or group of contracts when a clear economic decision has been made during contract negotiations that would produce different rates of profitability for each element or phase of the contract. Sales related to fixed-price contracts are recognized as deliveries are made, except for certain fixed-price contracts that require substantial performance over an extended period before deliveries begin, for which sales are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones. Sales related to contracts in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if specified targets are achieved. Incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated and are probable are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded. Program Accounting Our Commercial Airplanes segment uses program accounting to account for cost of sales related to its programs. Program accounting is applicable to products manufactured for delivery under production-type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contracts and years. Under program accounting, inventoriable production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced, and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. We recognize sales for commercial airplane deliveries as each unit is completed and accepted by the customer. Sales recognized represent the price negotiated with the customer, adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. The amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effects on program margins are recognized prospectively except in cases where the program is determined to have a reach-forward loss in which case the loss is recognized in the current period. Reductions to a reach-forward loss are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately. See Note 11 . Concession Sharing Arrangements We account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their purchase of products and services as a reduction to revenue when the related products and services are delivered. The sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendors products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products. Spare Parts Revenue We recognize sales of spare parts upon delivery and the amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost. Service Revenue Service revenue is recognized when the service is performed with the exception of U.S. government service agreements, which are accounted for using contract accounting. Service activities primarily include: support agreements associated with military aircraft and helicopter contracts, space travel on Commercial Crew, ongoing maintenance of International Space Station, military and commercial aircraft training contracts, fleet care, and technical and flight operation services for commercial aircraft. Service revenue and associated cost of sales from pay-in-advance subscription fees are deferred and recognized as services are rendered. Financial Services Revenue We record financial services revenue associated with sales-type/finance leases, operating leases, and notes receivable. Lease and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type/finance leases, we record an asset at lease inception. This asset is recorded at the aggregate of future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur. For operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets, included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated residual value, using the straight-line method. We periodically review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense. For notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note. Reinsurance Revenue Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Astro Ltd., participates in a reinsurance pool for workers compensation. The member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $141 , $147 and $136 during 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were $144 , $139 and $132 during 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Revenues and costs are presented net in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fleet Support We provide assistance and support to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation to the operators of all our commercial airplane models. Collectively known as fleet support, these activities and support services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering support, and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, and technical consulting support. This activity continues throughout the aircrafts operational life. Services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire models fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services. Research and Development Research and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design, and testing, as well as bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers. Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with our contract accounting policy. We have certain research and development arrangements that meet the requirement for best efforts research and development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expense rather than as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of $288 , $311 and $286 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Share-Based Compensation We provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value net of estimated forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. Income Taxes Provisions for U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Earnings before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. Tax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of Income tax expense. Postretirement Plans The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. We also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employees annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). A portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and reflected in inventory at the end of a reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in Shareholders equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities we amortize them over the average future service period of employees. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Postemployment Plans We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated. Environmental Remediation We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations, and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup, and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be able to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable were $116 and $77 at December 31, 2017 and 2016 . Inventories Inventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe benefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries and plant services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costs include amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one year. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering. Commercial aircraft programs inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production costs represent actual costs incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costs are experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor and other resources) than units produced later in a program because of volume efficiencies and the effects of learning. We expect that these deferred costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive from suppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier advances are amortized to work in process. The determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision is recorded. The determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimate revenue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity. When estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. Used aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value. See Aircraft Valuation within this Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or net realizable value. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired inventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs. Included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the ability to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwise recoverable, it would be written off in the current period. We net advances and progress billings on long-term contracts against inventory in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Advances and progress billings in excess of related inventory are reported in Advances and billings in excess of related costs. Precontract Costs We may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recovery from future orders, then we capitalize the precontract costs we incur, excluding start-up costs which are expensed as incurred. Capitalized precontract costs are included in Inventories, net of advances and progress billings, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Should future orders not materialize or we determine the costs are no longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and equipment, from 4 to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over 5 years. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition. Long-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Long-lived assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Asset Retirement Obligations We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material. We also have known conditional asset retirement obligations, such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liabilitys fair value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g., asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1. We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology, from 4 to 14 years; product know-how, from 3 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 17 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 27 years; and other, from 2 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Investments Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost. Available-for-sale securities include commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized based on the specific identification method. Available-for-sale securities are assessed for impairment quarterly. The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between 20% and 50% . We classify investment income and loss on our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on whether the investment is operating or non-operating in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, including our share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from certain cost method investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic purposes. Earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on marketable securities, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in Other income/(expense), net. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them. We use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes in fair value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is to include in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For our cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss of a cash flow hedge is reported in earnings immediately. We have agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives and international business requirements. These agreements are derivatives for accounting purposes but are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We also hold certain derivative instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For these aluminum agreements and for other derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings immediately. Aircraft Valuation Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments. Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of: ##TABLE_START (1) adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recognized upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) charges to cost of products for adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in Accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_END The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customers requirements; or the scrap market. Trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market or using current published third-party aircraft valuations based on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individual attributes and known conditions. Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer financing. Customer financing Customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/finance leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary. We assess the fair value of the assets we own, including equipment under operating leases, assets held for sale or re-lease, and collateral underlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are less than the related assets carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fair values of sales-type/finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables. We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications. Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Allowance for losses on customer financing receivables We record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in a valuation account, the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to two components of receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables. We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the receivable agreement, without regard to any subsequent restructurings. Factors considered in assessing collectability include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. We determine a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral we would expect to realize. We review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables (after excluding receivables subject to a specific impairment allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for each customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, for example, permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall. Each quarter we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables. Warranties In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material and design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a three to four -year standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards under our authorization. These warranties are included in the programs estimate at completion. On occasion we have made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warranties issued by our BDS segment principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons hardware and are included in the contract cost estimates. These sales are generally accompanied by a six month to two -year warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate. We provide guarantees to certain commercial airplane customers which include compensation provisions for failure to meet specified aircraft performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets, and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of the related aircraft. We have agreements that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to customers for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as a reduction in Cost of products at delivery of the related aircraft. These performance warranties and claims against suppliers are included in the programs estimate at completion. Supplier Penalties We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully anticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts. Guarantees We record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. For a residual value guarantee where we received a cash premium, the liability is equal to the cash premium received at the guarantees inception. For credit guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditors default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable, for each future period the credit guarantee will be outstanding. If at inception of a guarantee, we determine there is a probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value of the guarantee as described above or (b) the probable contingent loss amount. Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016 - 02, Leases  (Topic 842) . The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The standard will require lessees to report most leases as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, while lessor accounting will remain substantially unchanged. The standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for existing leases, whereby the new rules will be applied to the earliest year presented. We plan to adopt the new lease standard in 2019 and do not expect it to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are adopting ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) in the first quarter of 2018 using the retrospective transition method which will require 2016 and 2017 financial statements to be restated. The new standard requires revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also requires expanded disclosures regarding revenue and contracts with customers. Most of our defense contracts at BDS and BGS that have historically recognized revenue as deliveries are made or based on the attainment of performance milestones will recognize revenue under the new standard over time as costs are incurred. Certain military derivative aircraft contracts included in our BCA segment will also recognize revenue as costs are incurred. The new standard will not change the total amount of revenue recognized on these contracts, only accelerate the timing of when the revenue is recognized. In addition, the timing of cost of sales recognition for these contracts will be accelerated, resulting in a decrease in Inventories from long-term contracts in progress. The new standard will not affect revenue recognition or the use of program accounting for commercial airplane contracts. We will continue to recognize revenue for these contracts at the point in time when the customer accepts delivery of the airplane. Because revenue will be recognized under the new standard as costs are incurred for most of our defense and military derivative airplane contracts, approximately $10,000 of revenues and $1,300 of associated operating earnings will be accelerated into years ending prior to January 1, 2016. The restatement will result in a cumulative adjustment to increase retained earnings by $900 effective January 1, 2016. Restated income statements for 2016 and 2017 are shown below. We are also adopting ASU No. 2017-07 , Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost in the first quarter of 2018. The standard requires non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost to be presented in non-operating earnings using a retrospective transition method which will require us to restate 2016 and 2017 in the first quarter of 2018. In addition, only service costs may be allocated to production costs and capitalized in inventory on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2018. Adoption in the first quarter of 2018 is expected to result in a reclassification of non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost of $6 in 2017 and $478 in 2016 from Earnings from Operations to Other income/(loss), net. We applied a practical expedient as the estimation basis for this reclassification. Adoption of the new pension standard will not affect previously reported financial position, earnings per share, or cash flows. The impact to our 2017 and 2016 operating results as a result of adopting ASC Topic 606 and ASU No. 2017-07 is presented in the tables below: ##TABLE_START  Reported  Restated  Reported  Restated Years ended December 31,    Revenues:        Commercial Airplanes $56,729  $58,014  $58,012  $59,378 Defense, Space  Security 21,057  20,561  22,563  20,180 Global Services 14,639  14,581  13,925  13,819 Boeing Capital    Unallocated items, eliminations and other   (227 )  (179 ) Total revenues $93,392  $94,005  $94,571  $93,496 Earnings from operations:        Commercial Airplanes $5,432  $5,452  $1,995  $1,981 Defense, Space  Security 2,223  2,193  1,966  1,678 Global Services 2,256  2,246  2,177  2,159 Boeing Capital    Segment operating profit 10,025  10,005  6,197  5,877 Unallocated items, eliminations and other  (1,099 )  (363 )  (707 ) FAS/CAS service cost adjustment (1)   1,438    1,357 Earnings from operations 10,278  10,344  5,834  6,527 Other income/(loss), net (1)    (438 ) Interest and debt expense (360 )  (360 )  (306 )  (306 ) Earnings before income taxes 10,047  10,107  5,568  5,783 Income tax expense (1,850 )  (1,649 )  (673 )  (749 ) Net earnings $8,197  $8,458  $4,895  $5,034         Diluted earnings per share $13.43  $13.85  $7.61  $7.83 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the pension and postretirement service costs calculated under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and costs allocated to the business segments which are based on U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards for our defense businesses. Restated Other income/(loss), net includes the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost. ##TABLE_END In addition to the income statement changes described above, adoption of ASC Topic 606 is expected to increase total assets and total liabilities at December 31, 2017 and 2016 by approximately $20,000 and $19,000 primarily due to classifying certain advances from customers as liabilities under the new standard, whereas these advances were netted against inventory under existing GAAP. Adoption of ASU No. 2017-07 has no impact on total assets and total liabilities. The new standards have no impact on cash flows reported in 2017 and 2016. The impact of the new revenue standard on our 2017 and 2016 financial results may not be representative of the impact on our financial position and operating results in subsequent years. ASC Topic 606 requires additional detailed disclosures regarding the Companys contracts with customers, including disclosure of remaining unsatisfied performance obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 which we are continuing to assess. We have identified and implemented changes to the Companys business processes, systems and controls to support adoption of the new standard. Note 2  Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Commercial Airplanes  Defense, Space  Security  Global Services  Total Balance at January 1, 2016 $992  $2,648  $1,486  $5,126 Acquisitions (1)    Goodwill adjustments   (8 )  (8 ) Balance at December 31, 2016 $992  $2,854  $1,478  $5,324 Acquisitions (1)    Goodwill adjustments    Balance at December 31, 2017 (1) $992  $3,074  $1,493 $5,559 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  The increase in goodwill is primarily the result of acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2017. ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had indefinite-lived intangible assets with carrying amounts of $490 relating to trade names. The gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization of our acquired finite-lived intangible assets were as follows at December 31: ##TABLE_START    Gross Carrying Amount  Accumulated Amortization  Gross Carrying Amount  Accumulated Amortization Distribution rights $2,445  $943  $2,281  $797 Product know-how    Customer base    Developed technology    Other    Total $4,386  $2,303  $4,096  $2,046 ##TABLE_ENDAmortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $240 and $220 . Estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding years is as follows: ##TABLE_START      Estimated amortization expense $236  $213  $183  $174  $165 ##TABLE_ENDDuring 2017 and 2016 we acquired $298 and $113 of finite-lived intangible assets, of which $55 and $31 related to non-cash investing and financing transactions. Note 3  Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earnings per share for common shares and participating securities. The undistributed earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed earnings. Basic earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. The elements used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In millions - except per share amounts)       Years ended December 31,   Net earnings $8,197  $4,895  $5,176 Less: earnings available to participating securities   Net earnings available to common shareholders $8,191  $4,892  $5,172 Basic      Basic weighted average shares outstanding 603.2  636.5  688.0 Less: participating securities 0.7   1.1 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 602.5  635.5  686.9 Diluted      Basic weighted average shares outstanding 603.2  636.5  688.0 Dilutive potential common shares (1) 7.5  7.3  8.1 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 610.7  643.8  696.1 Less: participating securities 0.7  1.0  1.1 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 610.0  642.8  695.0 Net earnings per share:      Basic $13.60  $7.70  $7.52 Diluted 13.43  7.61  7.44 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Diluted earnings per share includes any dilutive impact of stock options, restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and performance awards. ##TABLE_END The following table includes the number of shares that may be dilutive potential common shares in the future.

The TCJA revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional tax benefits of $1,210 related to the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate. We also recorded a provisional tax expense of $159 related to tax on non-U.S. activities resulting from the TCJA. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded incremental tax benefits of $440 related to the application of a 2012 Federal Court of Claims decision which held that the tax basis in certain assets could be increased (tax basis adjustment). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  In the third quarter of 2016, a tax benefit of $177 was recorded as a result of the settlement of the 2011-2012 federal tax audit. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  In 2017 and 2016, we recorded excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments of $207 and $105 . ##TABLE_ENDSignificant components of our deferred tax (liabilities)/assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Inventory and long-term contract methods of income recognition (6,290 )  (9,954 ) Pension benefits 3,690  7,385 Retiree health care benefits 1,319  2,268 Fixed assets, intangibles and goodwill (net of valuation allowance of $16 and $16) (1,259 )  (2,007 ) Other employee benefits  1,225 Customer and commercial financing (369 )  (730 ) Accrued expenses and reserves  Net operating loss, credit and capital loss carryovers (net of valuation allowance of $53 and $79) (1)  Other (82 )  (57 ) Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets (2) ($1,498 )  ($1,006 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Of the deferred tax asset for net operating loss and credit carryovers, $278 expires on or before December 31, 2036 and $21 may be carried over indefinitely. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Included in the net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 are deferred tax assets in the amounts of $4,636 and $7,701 related to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. ##TABLE_END Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Deferred tax assets $8,459  $13,591 Deferred tax liabilities (9,888 )  (14,502 ) Valuation allowance (69 )  (95 ) Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets ($1,498 )  ($1,006 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The TCJA one-time repatriation tax liability effectively taxed the undistributed earnings previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We have not provided for foreign withholding tax on the undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. If such earnings were to be distributed, any foreign withholding tax would not be significant. In accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 the amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the TCJA represent reasonable estimates based on our analysis to date and are considered to be provisional and subject to revision during 2018. Provisional amounts were recorded for the repatriation tax, the remeasurement of our 2017 U.S. net deferred tax liabilities and ancillary state tax effects. These amounts are considered to be provisional as we continue to assess available tax methods and elections and refine our computations. In addition, further regulatory guidance related to the TCJA is expected to be issued in 2018 which may result in changes to our current estimates. Any revisions to the estimated impacts of TCJA will be recorded quarterly until the computations are complete which is expected no later than the fourth quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position were not significant. The amounts of interest benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 . A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: ##TABLE_START    Unrecognized tax benefits  January 1 $1,557  $1,617  $1,312 Gross increases  tax positions in prior periods   Gross decreases  tax positions in prior periods (44 )  (348 )  (25 ) Gross increases  current-period tax positions   Settlements  (73 )  Unrecognized tax benefits  December 31 $1,736  $1,557  $1,617 ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31 , 2017, 2016 and 2015 , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1,736 , $1,557 and $1,617 , respectively, of which $1,568 , $1,402 and $1,479 would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. As of December 31, 2017 , these amounts are primarily associated with U.S. federal tax issues such as the amount of research tax credits claimed, the U.S. manufacturing activity tax benefit and tax basis adjustments. Also included in these amounts are accruals for domestic state tax issues such as the allocation of income among various state tax jurisdictions and the amount of state tax credits claimed. Federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2013. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began the 2013-2014 federal tax audit in the fourth quarter of 2016. We are also subject to examination in major state and non-U.S. jurisdictions for the 2001-2016 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months unrecognized tax benefits related to federal and state matters under audit may decrease by up to $540 and $430 , respectively, based on current estimates. Note 5  Accounts Receivable, net Accounts receivable at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   U.S. government contracts $5,989  $4,639 Commercial Airplanes 1,542  1,375 Global Services (1) 1,472  1,257 Defense, Space  Security (1)  Reinsurance receivables  Other  Less valuation allowance (62 )  (65 ) Total $10,516  $8,832 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Excludes U.S. government contracts ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes our accounts receivable under long-term contracts that were unbillable or related to outstanding claims as of December 31 : ##TABLE_START  Unbillable  Claims     Current $2,876  $1,919  $4  $38 Expected to be collected after one year 1,564  2,011  $55  Total $4,440  $3,930  $59  $129 ##TABLE_ENDUnder contract accounting unbillable receivables on long-term contracts arise when the sales or revenues based on performance attainment, though appropriately recognized, cannot be billed yet under terms of the contract as of the balance sheet date. Any adjustment for the credit quality of unbillable receivables, if required, would be recorded as a direct reduction of revenue. Factors considered in assessing the collectability of unbillable receivables include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. Unbillable receivables related to commercial customers expected to be collected after one year were  $172 and $172 at December 31, 2017 and 2016 . Accounts receivable related to claims are items that we believe are earned, but are subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate realization. Accounts receivable, other than those described above, expected to be collected after one year are not material. Note 6  Inventories Inventories at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Long-term contracts in progress $13,889  $12,801 Commercial aircraft programs 52,861  52,048 Commercial spare parts, used aircraft, general stock materials and other 5,688  5,446 Inventory before advances and progress billings 72,438  70,295 Less advances and progress billings (28,094 )  (27,096 ) Total $44,344  $43,199 ##TABLE_ENDLong-Term Contracts in Progress Long-term contracts in progress includes Delta launch program inventory that is being sold at cost to United Launch Alliance ( ULA ) under an inventory supply agreement that terminates on March 31, 2021. The inventory balance was $120 (net of advances of $164 and $220 ) at December 31, 2017 and 2016 . See indemnifications to ULA in Note 12 . Included in inventories at December 31, 2017 and 2016 are capitalized precontract costs of $933 and $729 primarily related to KC-46A Tanker, C-17 and F/A-18. See Note 11 . Commercial Aircraft Programs At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 787 program: $30,695 and $32,501 of work in process (including deferred production costs of $25,358 and $27,308 ), $3,189 and $2,398 of supplier advances, and $3,173 and $3,625 of unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs. At December 31, 2017 , $22,220 of 787 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and $6,311 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , commercial aircraft programs inventory included $151 and $284 of unamortized tooling costs related to the 747 program. At December 31, 2017 , $146 of 747 unamortized tooling costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders or commitments. The program accounting quantity includes one already completed aircraft which is being remarketed. Commercial aircraft programs inventory included amounts credited in cash or other consideration (early issue sales consideration) to airline customers totaling $2,976 and $3,117 at December 31, 2017 and 2016 . Note 7  Customer Financing Customer financing primarily relates to the BCC segment and consisted of the following at December 31: ##TABLE_START   Financing receivables:    Investment in sales-type/finance leases $1,364  $1,482 Notes  Total financing receivables 2,041  2,289 Operating lease equipment, at cost, less accumulated depreciation of $320 and $359 1,020  1,922 Gross customer financing 3,061  4,211 Less allowance for losses on receivables (12 )  (10 ) Total $3,049  $4,201 ##TABLE_ENDThe components of investment in sales-type/finance leases at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Minimum lease payments receivable $1,159  $1,321 Estimated residual value of leased assets  Unearned income (290 )  (344 ) Total $1,364  $1,482 ##TABLE_ENDOperating lease equipment primarily includes large commercial jet aircraft. Financing receivable balances evaluated for impairment at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Individually evaluated for impairment $77  $55 Collectively evaluated for impairment 1,964  2,234 Total financing receivables $2,041  $2,289 ##TABLE_ENDWe determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms. At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we individually evaluated for impairment customer financing receivables of $77 and $55 , of which $66 and $44 were determined to be impaired. We recorded no allowance for losses on these impaired receivables as the collateral values exceeded the carrying values of the receivables. Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Income is recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer . The average recorded investment in impaired financing receivables for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $46 and the related interest income was insignificant. The change in the allowance for losses on financing receivables for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 , consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    Beginning balance - January 1 ($10 )  ($16 )  ($21 ) Customer financing valuation (cost)/benefit (2 )   Ending balance - December 31 ($12 )  ($10 )  ($16 ) Collectively evaluated for impairment ($12 )  ($10 )  ($16 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customer financing receivables are customer credit ratings, default rates and collateral values. We assign internal credit ratings for all customers and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers. Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies. Our financing receivable balances at December 31 by internal credit rating category are shown below: ##TABLE_START Rating categories  BBB $1,170  $1,324 BB  B  CCC  Total carrying value of financing receivables $2,041  $2,289 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2017 , our allowance related to receivables with ratings of B, BB and BBB. We applied default rates that averaged 22.6% , 4.7% and 0.9% to the exposure associated with those receivables. Customer Financing Exposure Customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance and overall market conditions and may be subject to reduced valuation with market decline. Declines in collateral values could result in asset impairments, reduced finance lease income, and an increase in the allowance for losses. Our customer financing collateral is concentrated in 747-8 and out-of-production aircraft. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have experienced greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft. The majority of customer financing carrying values are concentrated in the following aircraft models at December 31: ##TABLE_START   717 Aircraft ($269 and $301 accounted for as operating leases) $1,081  $1,282 747-8 Aircraft ($467 and $1,086 accounted for as operating leases)  1,111 MD-80 Aircraft (Accounted for as sales-type finance leases)  757 Aircraft ($27 and $43 accounted for as operating leases)  747-400 Aircraft ($88 and $149 Accounted for as operating leases)  737 Aircraft ($127 and $103 Accounted for as operating leases)  767 Aircraft ($25 and $85 accounted for as operating leases)  777 Aircraft (Accounted for as notes)  ##TABLE_ENDCharges related to customer financing asset impairment for the years ended December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Boeing Capital $13  $45  $162 Other Boeing   Total $43  $66  $162 ##TABLE_ENDScheduled receipts on customer financing are as follows: ##TABLE_START Year      Beyond 2022 Principal payments on notes receivable $149  $167  $132  $175  $37  $17 Sales-type/finance lease payments receivable      Operating lease equipment payments receivable      ##TABLE_ENDNote 8  Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Land $530  $535 Buildings and land improvements 14,125  13,796 Machinery and equipment 14,577  13,569 Construction in progress 1,081  1,790 Gross property, plant and equipment 30,313  29,690 Less accumulated depreciation (17,641 )  (16,883 ) Total $12,672  $12,807 ##TABLE_ENDDepreciation expense was $1,548 , $1,418 and $1,357 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Interest capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 totaled $110 , $170 and $158 , respectively. Rental expense for leased properties was $283 , $287 and $267 , for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. At December 31, 2017 , minimum rental payments under capital leases aggregated $147 . Minimum rental payments under operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more aggregated $1,355 , net of sublease payments of $13 at December 31, 2017 . Payments due under operating and capital leases net of sublease amounts and non-cancellable future rentals during the next five years are as follows: ##TABLE_START      Minimum operating lease payments, net of sublease amounts $216  $201  $157  $115  $96 Minimum capital lease payments     ##TABLE_ENDAccounts payable related to purchases of property, plant and equipment were $196 and $292 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 . Note 9  Investments Our investments, which are recorded in Short-term and other investments or Investments, consisted of the following at December 31: ##TABLE_START   Equity method investments (1) $1,214  $1,242 Time deposits  Available-for-sale investments  Other investments  Restricted cash  cash equivalents (2)  Total $2,439  $2,545 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Dividends received were $247 and $314 during 2017 and 2016 .

The net amounts owed to Boeing by each of the partners are as follows: S.P. Koroley Rocket and Space Corporation Energia of Russia (RSC Energia)  $223 , PO Yuzhnoye Mashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukraine  $89 and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine  $44 . In 2013, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launch partners. In 2016, the United States District Court for the Central District of California issued a judgment in favor of Boeing. Later that year, we reached an agreement which we believe will enable us to recover the outstanding receivable balance from RSC Energia over the next several years. We continue to pursue collection efforts against the former Ukrainian partners in connection with the court judgment. We continue to believe the partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and remedies. In the event we are unable to secure reimbursement from RSC Energia and the Ukrainian Sea Launch partners, we could incur additional charges. Spirit AeroSystems As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , Other assets included $137 and $143 of receivables related to indemnifications from Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. (Spirit), for costs incurred related to pension and retiree medical obligations of former Boeing employees who were subsequently employed by Spirit. During the fourth quarter of 2014, Boeing filed a complaint against Spirit in the Delaware Superior Court seeking to enforce our rights to indemnification and to recover from Spirit amounts incurred by Boeing for pension and retiree medical obligations. During 2017, the court ruled against Boeing and denied our claim. In January 2018, Boeing filed a notice of appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court. We believe we have substantial arguments on appeal and expect to fully recover from Spirit. Note 11  Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Accrued compensation and employee benefit costs $6,659  $5,720 Environmental  Product warranties 1,211  1,414 Forward loss recognition 1,683  1,385 Dividends payable 1,005  Income Taxes Payable  Other 3,830  4,655 Total $15,292  $14,691 ##TABLE_ENDEnvironmental The following table summarizes environmental remediation activity during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 . ##TABLE_START   Beginning balance  January 1 $562  $566 Reductions for payments made (45 )  (47 ) Changes in estimates  Ending balance  December 31 $524  $562 ##TABLE_ENDThe liabilities recorded represent our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred to remediate sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios that includes the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. There are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by $868 and $857 . Product Warranties The following table summarizes product warranty activity recorded during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 . ##TABLE_START   Beginning balance  January 1 $1,414  $1,485 Additions for current year deliveries  Reductions for payments made (241 )  (309 ) Changes in estimates (236 )  (118 ) Ending balance  December 31 $1,211  $1,414 ##TABLE_ENDCommercial Aircraft Commitments In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and airline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer. Trade-in commitment agreements at December 31, 2017 have expiration dates from 2018 through 2026 . At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , total contractual trade-in commitments were $1,462 and $1,485 . As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we estimated that it was probable we would be obligated to perform on certain of these commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling $155 and $126 and the fair value of the related trade-in aircraft was $155 and $126 . Financing Commitments Financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, and refinancing of delivered aircraft, totaled $10,221 and $14,847 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 . The estimated earliest potential funding dates for these commitments as of December 31, 2017 are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Total $2,047 2,975 1,396 1,322 935 Thereafter 1,546  $10,221 ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2017 , all of these financing commitments related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. We have concluded that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralization and interest rates, under which funding would be provided. Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $3,708 and $4,701 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 . Commitments to ULA We and Lockheed Martin Corporation have each committed to provide ULA with additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. As of December 31, 2017 , ULAs total remaining obligation to Boeing under the inventory supply agreement was $120 . See Note 6 . F/A-18 At December 31, 2017 , our backlog included 26 F/A-18 aircraft under contract with the U.S. Navy. We have begun work or authorized suppliers to begin working on aircraft beyond those already in backlog in anticipation of future orders. At December 31, 2017 , we had $155 of capitalized precontract costs and $855 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers associated with F/A-18 aircraft not yet ordered. Company Owned Life Insurance McDonnell Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life insurance policies with a cash surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the cash surrender value was $489 and $483 and the total loans were $470 and $456 . As we have the right to offset the loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 . United States Government Defense Environment Overview In November 2017, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 (FY2018), which authorizes a U.S. DoD budget topline higher than the administrations budget request from May. While the appropriations process for FY2018 remains incomplete, both the House and Senate appropriations committees have also produced bills that increase the U.S. DoD budget topline above the administrations request . On February 9, 2018, Congress passed a fifth Continuing Resolution that maintains current funding levels through March 23, 2018 and includes increases to the Budget Control Act caps for defense and non-defense spending for FY2018 and FY2019. However, the Budget Control Act continues to mandate limits on U.S. government discretionary spending and remains in effect. As a result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts will remain unless Congress acts to repeal or suspend this law.   Funding timeliness also remains a risk. If Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills or an omnibus spending bill before the expiration of the current Continuing Resolution, a government shutdown could result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts or program-level appropriations. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. DoD, the Department of Transportation, or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders.  In addition, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows.  BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work. BDS fixed-price contracts with significant development work include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker and commercial and military satellites. The operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost and revenue estimates could result in lower margins or material charges for reach-forward losses. For example, during 2017, we recorded additional reach-forward losses of $471 on the KC-46A Tanker program. Moreover, this and our other fixed-price development programs remain subject to additional reach-forward losses if we experience further technical or quality issues, schedule delays, or increased costs. KC-46A Tanker  In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. In 2016, the USAF authorized two low rate initial production (LRIP) lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at $2.8 billion . In January 2017, the USAF authorized an additional LRIP lot for 15 aircraft valued at $2.1 billion. At December 31, 2017 , we had approximately $347 of capitalized precontract costs and $1,024 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers. Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts Our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve for amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide refunds to the U.S. government. Note 12  Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees. The following table provides quantitative data regarding our third party guarantees. The maximum potential payments represent a worst-case scenario, and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset our payments under guarantees. The carrying amount of liabilities represents the amount included in Accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_START  Maximum Potential Payments  Estimated Proceeds from Collateral/ Recourse  Carrying Amount of Liabilities December 31, 2016  2016  2016 Contingent repurchase commitments $1,605 $1,306  $1,605 $1,306  $9 $9 Indemnifications to ULA:         Contributed Delta program launch inventory 77       Contract pricing 261     7 Other Delta contracts 216     Credit guarantees 29  27  2 ##TABLE_ENDContingent Repurchase Commitments The repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase commitments is generally lower than the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date. Indemnifications to ULA In 2006, we agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 of Boeing Delta launch program inventory included in contributed assets plus $1,860 of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021 . Since inception, ULA has consumed $1,288 of the $1,360 of inventory that was contributed by us and has yet to consume $72 . Under the inventory supply agreement, we have recorded revenues and cost of sales of $1,528 through December 31, 2017 . ULA has made payments of $1,740 to us under the inventory supply agreement and we have made $48 of net indemnification payments to ULA. We agreed to indemnify ULA against potential losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the USAF for four satellite missions. In 2009, ULA filed a complaint before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) for a contract adjustment for the price of two of these missions, followed in 2011 by a subsequent notice of appeal with respect to a third mission. The USAF did not exercise an option for a fourth mission prior to the expiration of the contract. During the second quarter of 2016, the ASBCA ruled that ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing for each of the three missions and remanded to the parties to negotiate appropriate pricing. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the USAF appealed the ASBCAs ruling. In April 2017, the USAF withdrew its appeal. If ULA is ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining additional pricing, we may be responsible for an indemnification payment up to $261 and may record up to $277 in pre-tax losses associated with the three missions. Potential payments for Other Delta contracts include $85 related to deferred support costs and $91 related to deferred production costs. In June 2011, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) notified ULA that it had determined that $271 of deferred support costs are not recoverable under government contracts. In December 2011, the DCMA notified ULA of the potential non-recoverability of an additional $114 of deferred production costs. ULA and Boeing believe that all costs are recoverable and in November 2011, ULA filed a certified claim with the USAF for collection of deferred support and production costs. The USAF issued a final decision denying ULAs certified claim in May 2012. In 2012, Boeing and ULA filed a suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking recovery of the deferred support and production costs from the U.S. government, which subsequently asserted a counterclaim for credits that it alleges were offset by deferred support cost invoices. We believe that the U.S. governments counterclaim is without merit. The discovery phase of the litigation completed in 2017, and during the fourth quarter, Boeing filed a motion for summary judgment for full recovery of its costs. If, contrary to our belief, it is determined that some or all of the deferred support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record pre-tax losses and make indemnification payments to ULA for up to $317 of the costs questioned by the DCMA. Other Indemnifications In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and our BCA facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 11 . Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees where we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that the original lessee or debtor does not make payments or perform certain specified services. Generally, these guarantees have been extended on behalf of guaranteed parties with less than investment-grade credit and are collateralized by certain assets. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire through 2036 . Industrial Revenue Bonds Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by St. Louis County were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property at our St. Louis site. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a twelve-year property tax abatement and sales tax exemption from St. Louis County. We record these properties on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. We have also purchased the IRBs and therefore are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the properties purchased with the IRB proceeds. The liabilities and IRB assets are equal and are reported net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the assets and liabilities associated with the IRBs were $166 and $64 . Note 13  Debt On February 16, 2017 , we issued $900 of fixed rate senior notes consisting of $300 due March 1, 2022 that bear an annual interest rate of 2.125% , $300 due March 1, 2027 that bear an annual interest rate of 2.8% , and $300 due March 1, 2047 that bear an annual interest rate of 3.65% . The notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds of the issuance totaled $871 , after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. Interest incurred, including amounts capitalized, was $541 , $535 and $497 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Interest expense recorded by BCC is reflected as Boeing Capital interest expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Total Company interest payments were $527 , $523 and $488 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. We have $5,000 currently available under credit line agreements, of which $2,500 is a 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in October 2018 , $2,470 expires in November 2022 , and $30 expires in November 2021 . The 364-day credit facility has a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration date. We continue to be in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt or credit facility agreements. Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Unsecured debt securities $599  $255 Non-recourse debt and notes  Capital lease obligations  Commercial Paper  Other notes  Total $1,335  $384 ##TABLE_ENDDebt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Unsecured debt securities    0.95% - 4.88% due through 2047 $6,127  5,250 5.80% - 6.88% due through 2043 2,386  2,383 7.25% - 8.75% due through 2043 1,637  1,641 Commercial paper   Variable rate: 3-month USD LIBOR plus 12.5 basis points due 2017  $250    Non-recourse debt and notes    6.98% - 7.38% notes due through 2021  Capital lease obligations due through 2034  Other notes  Total debt $11,117  $9,952 ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2017 , borrowings of commercial paper of $600 , with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.4% , were supported by unused commitments under the revolving credit agreement. We had no commercial paper borrowings in 2016. Total debt is attributable to: ##TABLE_START   BCC $2,523  $2,864 Other Boeing 8,594  7,088 Total debt $11,117  $9,952 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2017 , $94 of debt (non-recourse debt, notes and capital lease obligations) was collateralized by customer financing assets totaling $231 . Scheduled principal payments for debt and minimum capital lease obligations for the next five years are as follows: ##TABLE_START      Scheduled principal payments $1,340  $1,275  $1,148  $728  $554 ##TABLE_ENDNote 14  Postretirement Plans The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans participants, and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for future benefit payments. We also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for approximately half those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered by most United Auto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage. The funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). We have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Other assets, and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in Accrued liabilities. The components of net periodic benefit cost were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits Years ended December 31,      Service cost $402  $604  $1,764  $106  $128  $140 Interest cost 2,991  3,050  2,990    Expected return on plan assets (3,847 )  (3,999 )  (4,031 )  (7 )  (8 )  (8 ) Amortization of prior service (credits)/costs (39 )    (137 )  (126 )  (136 ) Recognized net actuarial loss   1,577    Settlement/curtailment/other losses      Net periodic benefit cost $312  $523  $2,786  $201  $278  $285             Net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations $639  $1,979  $2,366  $262  $274  $288 ##TABLE_ENDThe following tables show changes in the benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status of both pensions and OPB for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 . Benefit obligation balances presented below reflect the PBO for our pension plans, and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations (APBO) for our OPB plans. ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits     Change in benefit obligation        Beginning balance $76,745  $74,388  $6,431  $7,138 Service cost    Interest cost 2,991  3,050   Plan participants contributions    Amendments (7 )   (35 )  (57 ) Actuarial loss/(gain) 5,653  2,669  (204 )  (612 ) Settlement/curtailment/other (751 )  (63 )   Gross benefits paid (4,658 )  (3,903 )  (481 )  (469 ) Subsidies    Exchange rate adjustment  (7 )   Ending balance $80,393  $76,745  $6,085  $6,431 Change in plan assets        Beginning balance at fair value $56,692  $56,514   $132 Actual return on plan assets 8,552  3,885   Company contribution 4,025    Plan participants contributions    Settlement payments (744 )  (24 )   Benefits paid (4,530 )  (3,791 )  (16 )  (18 ) Exchange rate adjustment  (6 )   Ending balance at fair value $64,011  $56,692  $143  $134 Amounts recognized in statement of financial position at December 31 consist of:        Other assets $218  $3   Other accrued liabilities (129 )  (113 )  (397 )  (381 ) Accrued retiree health care   (5,545 )  (5,916 ) Accrued pension plan liability, net (16,471 )  (19,943 )   Net amount recognized ($16,382 )  ($20,053 )  ($5,942 )  ($6,297 ) ##TABLE_ENDAmounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits     Net actuarial loss/(gain) $22,942  $22,802  ($59 )  $152 Prior service (credits) (1,211 )  (1,243 )  (226 )  (328 ) Total recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss $21,731  $21,559  ($285 )  ($176 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe estimated amount that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during the year ending December 31, 2018 is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits Recognized net actuarial loss/(gain) $1,128  ($10 ) Amortization of prior service (credits) (56 )  (126 ) Total $1,072  ($136 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for all pension plans was $77,414 and $74,240 at December 31, 2017 and 2016 . Key information for our plans with ABO in excess of plan assets as of December 31 was as follows: ##TABLE_START   Projected benefit obligation $74,953  $76,586 Accumulated benefit obligation 71,975  74,081 Fair value of plan assets $58,353  $56,530 ##TABLE_ENDAssumptions The following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31 of each year and the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year. ##TABLE_START December 31,   Discount rate:      Pension 3.60 %  4.00 %  4.20 % Other postretirement benefits 3.30 %  3.70 %  3.80 % Expected return on plan assets 6.80 %  6.80 %  7.00 % Rate of compensation increase 5.30 %  4.40 %  4.00 % ##TABLE_ENDThe discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high quality bonds that are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yields developed from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. A portfolio of about 400 bonds is used to construct the yield curve. Since corporate bond yields are generally not available at maturities beyond 30 years, it is assumed that spot rates will remain level beyond that 30-year point. The present value of each plans benefits is calculated by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows. All bonds are U.S. issues, with a minimum outstanding of $50. The pension funds expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the upcoming plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five -year moving average of plan assets. As of December 31, 2017 , the MRVA was approximately $2,260 less than the fair market value of assets. Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows: ##TABLE_START December 31,   Health care cost trend rate assumed next year 6.00 %  6.50 %  6.50 % Ultimate trend rate 4.50 %  5.00 %  5.00 % Year that trend reached ultimate rate   ##TABLE_ENDAssumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. To determine the health care cost trend rates we look at a combination of information including ongoing claims cost monitoring, annual statistical analyses of claims data, reconciliation of forecast claims against actual claims, review of trend assumptions of other plan sponsors and national health trends, and adjustments for plan design changes, workforce changes, and changes in plan participant behavior. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect: ##TABLE_START  Increase  Decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost $45  ($37 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation  (448 ) ##TABLE_ENDPlan Assets Investment Strategy The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified. We periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investment benchmarks to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced on a monthly basis. The actual and target allocations by asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Actual Allocations  Target Allocations Asset Class    Fixed income %  %  %  % Global equity    Private equity    Real estate and real assets    Hedge funds    Total %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDFixed income securities are invested primarily in a diversified portfolio of long duration instruments. Global equity securities are invested in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various industries and market capitalizations. Real estate and real assets include global private investments that may be held through an investment in a limited partnership (LP) or other fund structures and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the case of real estate). Real estate includes, but is not limited to, investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include, but are not limited to, investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber), commodities and infrastructure. Private equity investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies. Hedge fund investments seek to capitalize on inefficiencies identified across and within different asset classes or markets. Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to directional, event driven, relative value, long-short and multi-strategy. Investment managers are retained for explicit investment roles specified by contractual investment guidelines. Certain investment managers are authorized to use derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve the desired market exposure of a security or an index, transfer value-added performance between asset classes, achieve the desired currency exposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation. As a percentage of total pension plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were 5.0% and 6.0% for fixed income, including to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and 6.9% and 1.2% for global equity and commodities at December 31, 2017 and 2016 . In August 2017, the Company elected to contribute $3,500 of our common stock to the pension fund. An independent fiduciary was retained to manage and liquidate the stock over time at its discretion. The liquidation of the common stock holdings was completed during the fourth quarter of 2017. Risk Management In managing the plan assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach and are integral to the overall investment strategy. Further, asset classes are constructed to achieve diversification by investment strategy, by investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored regularly through the custodian. Credit parameters for counterparties have been established for managers permitted to trade over-the-counter derivatives. Valuation is governed through several types of procedures, including reviews of manager valuation policies, custodian valuation processes, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconciliation, and periodic, security-specific valuation testing . Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 . The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016  Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fixed income securities:         Corporate $19,603 $19,591 $12 $16,730 $16,723 $7 U.S. government and agencies 5,430 5,430 4,876 4,875 Mortgage backed and asset backed 460 706 336 Municipal 1,355 1,355 1,398  1,398 Sovereign 1,237 1,237   Other $59 74 $9 Derivatives:       Assets 49 40 Liabilities (25 ) (25 ) (38 ) (38 ) Cash equivalents and other short-term investments 1,778 1,778 1,037 1,037 Equity securities:       U.S. common and preferred stock 4,615 4,615 5,374 5,373 Non-U.S. common and preferred stock 6,204 6,204 5,746 5,746 Derivatives:       Assets 1 6 Liabilities (4 ) (4 ) (8 ) (8 ) Private equity  Real estate and real assets:       Real estate 462 468 Real assets 449 3 372 5 Derivatives:       Assets 17 4 Liabilities (3 ) (3 ) (1 ) (1 ) Total $42,305 $11,790 $30,200 $315 $37,866 $11,968 $25,548 $350          Fixed income common/collective/pooled funds $1,257    $1,625    Fixed income other       Equity common/collective pooled funds 6,786    4,962    Private equity 2,767    2,639    Real estate and real assets 3,744    3,625    Hedge funds 6,440    5,441    Total investments measured at NAV as a practical expedient $21,297    $18,519             Cash $170    $160    Receivables       Payables (197 )    (227 )    Total $64,011    $56,692    ##TABLE_ENDFixed income securities are primarily valued upon a market approach, using matrix pricing and considering a securitys relationship to other securities for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or an income approach, converting future cash flows to a single present value amount. Inputs used in developing fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads. Common/collective/pooled funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their NAVs that are calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives included in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued using an income approach with inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates. Exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Cash equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingled fund (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued daily using a market approach with inputs that include quoted market prices for similar instruments. In the event a market price is not available for instruments with an original maturity of one year or less, amortized cost is used as a proxy for fair value. Common and preferred stock equity securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Private equity and private debt NAV valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) we use NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Real estate and real asset NAV valuations are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) NAVs are adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Publicly traded REITs and infrastructure stocks are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Hedge fund NAVs are generally based on the valuation of the underlying investments. This is primarily done by applying a market or income valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument held. Investments in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the General Partner (GP), fund manager or third party administrator. Additionally, some investments in fixed income and equity are made via commingled vehicles and are valued in a similar fashion. Pension assets invested in commingled and limited partnership structures rely on the NAV of these investments as the practical expedient for the valuations. The following tables present a reconciliation of Level 3 assets (excluding investments which are valued using NAVs as a practical expedient) held during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 . Transfers into and out of Level 3 are reported at the beginning-of-year values. ##TABLE_START  January 1 2017 Balance  Net Realized and Unrealized Gains/(Losses)  Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements  Net Transfers Out of Level 3  December 31 2017 Balance Fixed income securities:          Corporate (1) $12    $1  ($1 )  $12 U.S. government and agencies    (1 )  Mortgage backed and asset backed (1)  $10  (39 )  (2 )  Equity securities:         U.S. common and preferred stock  (1 )    Real assets   (2 )   Total $350  $9  ($40 )  ($4 )  $315 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  January 1 2016 Balance  Net Realized and Unrealized Gains/(Losses)  Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements  Net Transfers Out of Level 3  December 31 2016 Balance Fixed income securities:          Corporate (1) $11   ($1 )  ($3 )  $7 U.S. government and agencies        Mortgage backed and asset backed (1)  $7  (93 )  (18 )  Equity securities:         U.S. common and preferred stock       Non-U.S. common and preferred stock    (2 )   Private equity  (3 )     Real assets   (1 )    Total $464  $4  ($97 )  ($21 )  $350 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Certain fixed income securities were reclassified between mortgage backed and asset backed to corporate on January 1, 2017 and 2016. ##TABLE_END The changes in unrealized gains for Level 3 mortgage backed and asset backed fixed income securities still held at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $6  and  $4 . OPB Plan Assets The majority of OPB plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised of approximately 60% equities and 40% debt securities. The index fund is valued using a market approach based on the quoted market price of an identical instrument (Level 1). The expected rate of return on these assets does not have a material effect on the net periodic benefit cost. Cash Flows Contributions Required pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ), as well as rules governing funding of our non-US pension plans, are not expected to be significant in 2018 . During the third quarter of 2017, we contributed $500 in cash and $3,500 in common stock. We do not expect to make contributions to our pension plans in 2018 . Estimated Future Benefit Payments The table below reflects the total pension benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants share of the cost, which is funded by participant contributions. OPB payments reflect our portion only. ##TABLE_START Year(s)      2023-2027 Pensions $4,758  $4,712  $4,740  $4,703  $4,631  $22,770 Other postretirement benefits:            Gross benefits paid      2,364 Subsidies (16 )  (16 )  (17 )  (17 )  (17 )  (87 ) Net other postretirement benefits $480  $491  $500  $503  $499  $2,277 ##TABLE_ENDTermination Provisions Certain of the pension plans provide that, in the event there is a change in control of the Company which is not approved by the Board of Directors and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required by ERISA , and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits in our group insurance benefit programs. Should we terminate certain pension plans under conditions in which the plans assets exceed that plans obligations, the U.S. government will be entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plans assets based on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts. Defined Contribution Plans We provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expense for these defined contribution plans was $1,522 , $1,413 and $768 in 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Note 15  Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements Share-Based Compensation Our 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated, permits awards of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or units, performance shares, performance restricted stock or units, performance units and other stock and cash-based awards to our employees, officers, directors, consultants, and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock authorized for issuance under the plan is 87,000,000 . Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfy these issuances during 2018 . Share-based plans expense is primarily included in General and administrative expense since it is incentive compensation issued primarily to our executives. The share-based plans expense and related income tax benefit were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Stock options  $4  $30 Restricted stock units and other awards   Share-based plans expense $212  $193  $190 Income tax benefit $46  $69  $68 ##TABLE_ENDStock Options We discontinued granting options in 2014, replacing them with performance-based restricted stock units. Options granted through January 2014 had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. The stock options vested over a period of three years and were fully vested at December 31, 2017 . Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2017 is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Shares  Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share  Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years)  Aggregate Intrinsic Value Number of shares under option:        Outstanding at beginning of year 8,646,612  $72.64     Exercised (4,224,194)  73.61     Expired (5,200)  89.65     Outstanding at end of year 4,417,218  $71.69  3.93  $986 Exercisable at end of year 4,417,218  $71.69  3.93  $986 ##TABLE_ENDThe total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $491 , $265 and $385 , with a related tax benefit of $175 , $94 and $135 , respectively. The grant date fair value of stock options vested during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $0 , $27 and $56 , respectively. Restricted Stock Units In February 2017, 2016 and 2015 , we granted to our executives 523,835 , 777,837 and 590,778  restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of $178.72 , $117.50 and $154.64 per unit, respectively. The RSUs granted under this program will vest and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. In addition to RSUs awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant RSUs to certain executives and employees to encourage retention or to reward various achievements. These RSUs are labeled other RSUs in the table below. The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average of the high and low stock prices on the date of grant. RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2017 was as follows: ##TABLE_START  Long-Term Incentive Program  Other Number of units:    Outstanding at beginning of year 1,814,644  1,077,920 Granted 570,538  390,152 Dividends 45,799  30,477 Forfeited (142,907 )  (40,670 ) Distributed (660,972 )  (301,417 ) Outstanding at end of year 1,627,102  1,156,462 Unrecognized compensation cost $98  $82 Weighted average remaining contractual life (years) 1.8  3.4 ##TABLE_ENDThe number of vested but undistributed RSUs at December 31, 2017 was not significant. Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PBRSUs) are stock units that pay out based on the Companys total shareholder return as compared to a group of peer companies over a three-year period. The award payout can range from 0% to 200% of the initial PBRSU grant, but will not exceed 400% of the initial value (excluding dividend equivalent credits). The PBRSUs granted under this program will vest at the payout amount and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) remains eligible under the award and, if the award is earned, will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the PBRSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. In February 2017, 2016 and 2015 , we granted to our executives 492,273 , 721,176 and 556,203 PBRSUs as part of our long-term incentive program. Compensation expense for the award is recognized over the three-year performance period based upon the grant date fair value. The grant date fair values were estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model with the assumptions presented below. The model includes no expected dividend yield as the units earn dividend equivalents. ##TABLE_START Grant Year Grant Date Performance Period Expected Volatility Risk Free Interest Rate Grant Date Fair Value 2/27/2017 3 years 21.37 % 1.46 % 190.17 2/22/2016 3 years 22.44 % 0.92 % 126.74 2/23/2015 3 years 20.35 % 1.03 % 164.26 ##TABLE_ENDPBRSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2017 was as follows: ##TABLE_START   Long-Term Incentive Program Number of units:   Outstanding at beginning of year  1,746,511 Granted  492,273 Performance based adjustment (1)  137,363 Dividends  54,683 Forfeited  (130,367 ) Distributed  (748,729 ) Outstanding at end of year  1,551,734 Unrecognized compensation cost  $90 Weighted average remaining contractual life (years)  1.8 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Represents net incremental number of units issued at vesting based on TSR for units granted in 2014 ##TABLE_END Other Compensation Arrangements Performance Awards Performance Awards are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a three-year period. Each unit has an initial value of $100 dollars. The amount payable at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars per unit, depending on the Companys performance against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to pay these awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on the estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period. During 2017, 2016 and 2015 , we granted Performance Awards to our executives as part of our long-term incentive program with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals for each three -year period following the grant date. The minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out for the 2017, 2016 and 2015 Performance Awards is $352 , $318 and $312 , respectively. The 2015 grant is expected to be paid out in cash in March 2018 . Deferred Compensation The Company has deferred compensation plans which permit employees to defer a portion of their salary, bonus, certain other incentive awards, and retirement contributions. Participants can diversify these amounts among 22 investment funds including a Boeing stock unit account. Total expense related to deferred compensation was $240 , $46 and $63 in 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the deferred compensation liability which is being marked to market was $1,547 and $1,289 . Note 16  Shareholders Equity On December 11, 2017 , the Board approved a new repurchase plan for up to $18,000 of common stock, replacing the previously authorized program. The program will expire when we have used all authorized funds or is otherwise terminated. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , there were 1,200,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. No preferred stock has been issued. Changes in Share Balances The following table shows changes in each class of shares: ##TABLE_START  Common Stock  Treasury Stock Balance at January 1, 2015 1,012,261,159  305,533,606 Issued   (7,288,113 ) Acquired   47,391,861 Balance at December 31, 2015 1,012,261,159  345,637,354 Issued   (6,376,868 ) Acquired   55,849,082 Balance at December 31, 2016 1,012,261,159  395,109,568 Issued   (20,746,426 ) Acquired   46,859,184 Balance at December 31, 2017 1,012,261,159  421,222,326 ##TABLE_ENDAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Changes in Accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) by component for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Currency Translation Adjustments  Unrealized Gains and Losses on Certain Investments  Unrealized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments  Defined Benefit Pension Plans  Other Postretirement Benefits  Total (1) Balance at January 1, 2015 $53  ($8 )  ($136 )  ($13,812 )  ($13,903 ) Other comprehensive (loss)/income before reclassifications (92 )   (140 )   (51 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI    1,127 (2)  1,206 Net current period Other comprehensive (loss)/income (92 )   (61 )  1,300  1,155 Balance at December 31, 2015 ($39 )  $  ($197 )  ($12,512 )  ($12,748 ) Other comprehensive loss before reclassifications (104 )  (2 )  (8 )  (1,320 )  (1,434 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI    (2)  Net current period Other comprehensive (loss)/income (104 )  (2 )   (839 )  (875 ) Balance at December 31, 2016 ($143 )  ($2 )  ($127 )  ($13,351 )  ($13,623 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications    (478 )  (230 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI    (2)  Net current period Other comprehensive income/(loss)    (53 )  Balance at December 31, 2017 ($15 )  ($1 )  $44  ($13,404 )  ($13,376 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Net of tax. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Primarily relates to amortization of actuarial losses for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 totaling $542 , $524 , and $1,038 (net of tax of ($272) , ($288) , and ($570) ), respectively. These are included in the net periodic pension cost of which a portion is allocated to production as inventoried costs. See Note 14 . ##TABLE_ENDNote 17  Derivative Financial Instruments Cash Flow Hedges Our cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage currency risk associated with certain transactions, specifically forecasted sales and purchases made in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2024 . We use commodity derivatives, such as fixed-price purchase commitments to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. Our commodity contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2021 . Fair Value Hedges Interest rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt. The net change in fair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in Boeing Capital interest expense. Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment We have entered into agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives and non-U.S. business requirements. These agreements are derivative instruments for accounting purposes. The quantities of aluminum in these agreements offset and are priced at prevailing market prices. We also hold certain foreign currency forward contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Notional Amounts and Fair Values The notional amounts and fair values of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Notional amounts (1) Other assets Accrued liabilities   2017  2017  Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:          Foreign exchange contracts $2,930  $2,584 $131  $34 ($63 )  ($225 ) Interest rate contracts  3     Commodity contracts  4  (6 )  (5 ) Derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment:          Foreign exchange contracts  16  (5 )  (17 ) Commodity contracts        Total derivatives $4,080  $3,875  (74 )  (247 ) Netting arrangements    (61 )  (45 )  Net recorded balance    $93  $23 ($13 ) ($202 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Notional amounts represent the gross contract/notional amount of the derivatives outstanding. ##TABLE_END Gains/(losses) associated with our cash flow and undesignated hedging transactions and their effect on Other comprehensive income/(loss) and Net earnings were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  Effective portion recognized in Other comprehensive income/(loss), net of taxes:    Foreign exchange contracts $123  ($9 ) Commodity contracts (4 )  Effective portion reclassified out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings, net of taxes:    Foreign exchange contracts (50 )  (70 ) Commodity contracts (2 )  (8 ) Forward points recognized in Other income, net:    Foreign exchange contracts  Undesignated derivatives recognized in Other income, net:    Foreign exchange contracts  (2 ) ##TABLE_ENDBased on our portfolio of cash flow hedges, we expect to reclassify losses of $12 (pre-tax) out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings during the next 12 months. Ineffectiveness related to our hedges recognized in Other income was insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 . We have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. For foreign exchange contracts with original maturities of at least five years, our derivative counterparties could require settlement if we default on our five-year credit facility. For certain commodity contracts, our counterparties could require collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and commodity contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at December 31, 2017 was $13 . At December 31, 2017 , there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives. Note 18  Significant Group Concentrations of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments involving potential credit risk are predominantly with commercial aircraft customers and the U.S. government. Of the $13,639 in gross accounts receivable and gross customer financing included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2017 , $5,572 related predominantly to commercial aircraft customers ( $2,512 of accounts receivable and $3,060 of customer financing) and $5,989 related to the U.S. government. Of the $3,061 in gross customer financing, $1,828 related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit including Silk Way, American, and Hawaiian Airlines who were associated with 14% , 8% , and 7% , respectively, of our financing portfolio. Financing for aircraft is collateralized by security in the related asset and in some instances security in other assets as well. Other Risk As of December 31, 2017 , approximately 37% of our total workforce was represented by collective bargaining agreements. Note 19  Fair Value Measurements The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy. ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016  Total Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Assets       Money market funds $1,582 $1,582  $2,858 $2,858  Available-for-sale investments:       Commercial paper  162  Corporate notes  271  U.S. government agencies  63  Other 18  46  Derivatives  23  $23 Total assets $2,192 $1,600 $592 $3,423 $2,904 $519        Liabilities       Derivatives ($13 )  ($13 ) ($202 )  ($202 ) Total liabilities ($13 )  ($13 ) ($202 )  ($202 ) ##TABLE_ENDMoney market funds, available-for-sale debt investments and equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices or broker/dealer quotes of identical or comparable instruments. Derivatives include foreign currency, commodity and interest rate contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve. Certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following table presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended December 31 due to long-lived asset impairment, and the fair value and asset classification of the related assets as of the impairment date: ##TABLE_START    Fair Value  Total Losses  Fair Value  Total Losses Investments $1  ($44 )   Operating lease equipment  (32 )  $84  ($52 ) Other assets and Acquired intangible assets  (23 )   (10 ) Property, plant and equipment  (2 )   (9 ) Total $113  ($101 )  $106  ($71 ) ##TABLE_ENDInvestments, Acquired intangible assets and Property, plant and equipment were primarily valued using an income approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. The fair value of the impaired operating lease equipment is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of third party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades and other market factors. Management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued appropriateness and consistency with market trends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected net sales price for the aircraft. For Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2017 , the following table presents the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques and related unobservable inputs of those assets. ##TABLE_START  Fair Value  Valuation Technique(s)  Unobservable Input  Range Median or Average Operating lease equipment $90  Market approach  Aircraft value publications  $140 - $191 (1) Median $167   Aircraft condition adjustments  ($77) - $0 (2) Net ($77) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  The range represents the sum of the highest and lowest values for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, according to the third party aircraft valuation publications that we use in our valuation process. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The negative amount represents the sum, for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, of all downward adjustments based on consideration of individual aircraft attributes and condition. The positive amount represents the sum of all such upward adjustments. ##TABLE_END Fair Value Disclosures The fair values and related carrying values of financial instruments that are not required to be remeasured at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2017  Carrying Amount  Total Fair Value  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets          Notes receivable, net $677  $682    $682   Liabilities          Debt, excluding capital lease obligations and commercial paper (10,380 )  (11,923 )    (11,823 )  ($100 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  December 31, 2016  Carrying Amount  Total Fair Value  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets          Notes receivable, net $807  $803    $803   Liabilities          Debt, excluding capital lease obligations (9,815 )  (11,209 )    (11,078 )  ($131 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe fair values of notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on current market yields. For our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowing cost derived from dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. The fair values of our debt classified as Level 3 are based on discounted cash flow models using the implied yield from similar securities. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain. Items not included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, Accounts receivable, Accounts payable and long-term payables. The carrying values of those items, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at December 31, 2017 and 2016 . The fair value of assets and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1). Note 20  Legal Proceedings Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are pending against us. In addition, we are subject to various U.S. government inquiries and investigations from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, or government dispute and investigation will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Note 21  Segment Information Effective July 1, 2017, we now operate in four reportable segments: BCA , BDS , BGS , and BCC. The new segment, BGS, brings together the Commercial Aviation Services businesses, previously included in the BCA segment, and certain BDS businesses (primarily those previously included in the Global Services  Support segment). All other activities fall within Unallocated items, eliminations and other. See page 51 for the Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note. Prior year numbers have been revised to conform to the current segment presentation. BCA develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide. BDS is engaged in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and related services: manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems, surveillance and engagement, strategic defense and intelligence systems, satellite systems and space exploration. BGS provides parts, maintenance, modifications, logistics support, training, data analytics and information-based services to commercial and government customers worldwide. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers. Unallocated items, eliminations and other include common internal services that support Boeings global business operations, intercompany guarantees provided to BCC and eliminations of certain sales between segments. Revenues, including foreign military sales, are reported by customer location and consist of the following: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Asia, other than China $8,899  $10,553  $13,433 Europe 11,457  13,790  12,248 China 11,911  10,312  12,556 Middle East 12,287  13,297  10,846 Oceania 2,061  1,843  2,601 Canada 2,197  2,076  1,870 Africa  1,999  1,398 Latin America, Caribbean and other 1,494  1,936  1,875 Total non-U.S. revenues 51,061  55,806  56,827 United States 42,331  38,765  39,287 Total revenues $93,392  $94,571  $96,114 ##TABLE_ENDRevenues from the U.S. government (including foreign military sales through the U.S. government), primarily recorded at BDS and BGS, represented 31% , 23% and 27% of consolidated revenues for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Approximately 5% and 4% of operating assets were located outside the United States as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 .

For segment reporting purposes, we record Commercial Airplanes segment revenues and cost of sales for airplanes transferred to other segments. Such transfers may include airplanes accounted for as operating leases and considered transferred to the BCC segment and airplanes transferred to the BDS segment for further modification prior to delivery to the customer. In addition, BGS segment revenue and costs include certain services provided to other segments. The revenues and cost of sales for these transfers are eliminated in the Unallocated items and eliminations caption. For segment reporting purposes, we record BDS revenues and cost of sales for the modification performed on airplanes received from Commercial Airplanes when the airplane is delivered to the customer or at the attainment of performance milestones.

During the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of the enactment of the TCJA, we recorded incremental tax benefits of $1,051 , primarily related to the remeasurement of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities. During 2017 and 2016, higher estimated costs to complete the KC-46A Tanker contract for the U.S. Air Force resulted in reach-forward losses. We recorded $329 and $142 in the third and first quarter of 2017. We recorded $312 , $573 and $243 in the fourth, second and first quarter of 2016, respectively.

During the second quarter of 2016 and first quarter of 2016, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,188 and $70 on the 747 program. During the second quarter of 2016, we determined that the fourth and fifth flight test aircraft for the 787 program are not commercially saleable, and we reclassified costs of $1,235 associated with these aircraft from 787 program inventory to research and development expense. During the third quarter of 2016, we recorded an incremental tax benefit of $440  that related to the application of a 2012 Federal Court of Claims decision. We also recorded a tax benefit of $177  as a result of the 2011-2012 federal tax audit settlements.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 12, 2018 , expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP  Chicago, Illinois February 12, 2018  We have served as the Company's auditor since at least 1934; however, an earlier year cannot be reliably determined. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Boeing Company Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 , of the Company and our report dated February 12, 2018 , expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP  Chicago, Illinois February 12, 2018  ", "9A": " Item 9A.

Business The Boeing Company, together with its subsidiaries (herein referred to as Boeing, the Company, we, us, our), is one of the worlds major aerospace firms. We are organized based on the products and services we offer. We operate in four reportable segments: ##TABLE_START  Commercial Airplanes (BCA); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Defense, Space  Security ( BDS ); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Global Services ( BGS ); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Boeing Capital ( BCC ). ##TABLE_ENDCommercial Airplanes Segment This segment develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft and provides fleet support services, principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide. We are a leading producer of commercial aircraft and offer a family of commercial jetliners designed to meet a broad spectrum of global passenger and cargo requirements of airlines. This family of commercial jet aircraft in production includes the 737 narrow-body model and the 747, 767, 777 and 787 wide-body models. Development continues on certain 737 MAX derivatives and the 777X program. Defense, Space  Security Segment This segment is engaged in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems for strike, surveillance and mobility, including fighter and trainer aircraft; vertical lift, including rotorcraft and tilt-rotor aircraft; and commercial derivative aircraft, including anti-submarine and tanker aircraft. In addition, this segment is engaged in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and related services: strategic defense and intelligence systems, including strategic missile and defense systems, command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR), cyber and information solutions, and intelligence systems; satellite systems, including government and commercial satellites and space exploration. BDS' primary customer is the United States Department of Defense ( U.S. DoD ). Revenues from the U.S. DoD, including foreign military sales through the U.S. government, accounted for approximately 86% of its 2018 revenues. Other significant BDS customers include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and customers in international defense, civil and commercial satellite markets. This segment's primary products include the following fixed-wing military aircraft: F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 Strike Eagle, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker, and T-X Trainer. This segment produces rotorcraft and rotary-wing programs, such as CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, and V-22 Osprey. In addition, this segment's products include space and missile systems including: government and commercial satellites, the International Space Station, Commercial Crew, missile defense and weapons programs, and Joint Direct Attack Munition, as well as the United Launch Alliance joint venture. Global Services Segment This segment provides services to our commercial and defense customers worldwide. BGS sustains aerospace platforms and systems with a full spectrum of products and services, including supply chain and logistics management, engineering, maintenance and modifications, upgrades and conversions, spare parts, pilot and maintenance training systems and services, technical and maintenance documents, and data analytics and digital services. Boeing Capital Segment BCC seeks to ensure that Boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing product and manages overall financing exposure. BCC s portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases, finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and investments. Intellectual Property We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. Employees Total workforce level at December 31, 2018 was approximately 153,000 . As of December 31, 2018 , our principal collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions: ##TABLE_START Union Percent of our Employees Represented Status of the Agreements with Major Union The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) 22% We have two major agreements; one expiring in June 2022 and one in September 2024. The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) 11% We have two major agreements expiring in Octo ber 2022. The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) 1% We have one major agreement expiring in October 2022. ##TABLE_ENDCompetition The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as Airbus and other entrants from Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with greater value products. BDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In addition, certain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2019 . The commercial and defense services market is an extremely challenging landscape made up of many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering products and services which span the life cycle of our defense and commercial airplane programs: training, fleet services and logistics, maintenance and engineering, modifications and upgrades - as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. BGS expects the market to remain highly competitive in 2019 , and intends to grow market share by leveraging a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. Regulatory Matters Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets. Government Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default. Commercial Aircraft. In the U.S., our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Outside the U.S., similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Joint Aviation Authorities. Environmental. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations. A Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site for which we were originally assigned a partial share, the statutory framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-U.S. Sales. Our non-U.S. sales are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, tariffs, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S. sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks. Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take a year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of companies. Suppliers We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and program/contract profitability, thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. We are also dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices. Seasonality No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report. Our Commercial Airplanes and Global Services businesses depend heavily on commercial airlines, and are subject to unique risks. Market conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological advances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. In addition, availability of financing to non-U.S. customers depends in part on the Export-Import Bank of the United States being fully operational. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally, or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period. We enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers. Our Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards. The commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S. suppliers, highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy regulatory and customer requirements, and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. We must minimize disruption caused by production changes and achieve productivity improvements in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have plans to adjust production rates on several of our commercial aircraft programs, while at the same time engaging in significant ongoing development and production of the 777X aircraft. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements, and optimizing how we manage inventory. If production rate changes at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and/or the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer. Operational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins. Our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory certifications, could result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support costs. If our commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly and technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues. Changes in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the United States Department of Defense ( U.S. DoD ). Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such as the political environment, U.S. foreign policy, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as authorization and appropriations bills. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 raised preexisting spending caps for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 (FY18 and FY19). The consolidated spending bills signed into law in September 2018 provide defense funding for FY19. However, other departments and agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), are being temporarily funded at FY18 levels. Failure to enact a Continuing Resolution or FY19 appropriations by February 15, 2019 would result in a partial government shutdown affecting these departments and agencies. Such a shutdown could impact the Companys operations. In addition, reduced discretionary spending limits initially enacted in 2011 would take effect again in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (FY20 and FY21) unless Congress acts to raise the spending caps or to repeal or suspend the law establishing the reduced limits. As a result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain and it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to pressure. In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to future program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies (including NASA) within the overall budgetary framework described above. While the House and Senate Appropriations Committees included funding for Boeings major programs, such as F/A-18 Super Hornet, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, V-22 Osprey, KC-46A Pegasus Tanker and P-8 Poseidon, in their final FY19 defense appropriations, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in FY20 and beyond will affect Boeings programs. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. In addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both U.S. defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment, we expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. If we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition priorities and/or fail to meet affordability targets set by the U.S. DoD customer, our revenues and market share would be further impacted. We conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks. In 2018 , 31% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign military sales (FMS) through the U.S. government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks. Our sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs. New procurement regulations, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our compliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS and BGS businesses. These requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could be subject to additional costs in the form of withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply with these requirements in the future. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as continuing resolutions rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position. We are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S. government contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, routinely audit government contractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false. We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns. Our BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 65% and 77% of their 2018 revenues from fixed-price contracts. While fixed-price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. For example, during 2018, we recorded reach-forward losses totaling $736 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract primarily reflecting higher estimated costs associated with certification, testing and change incorporation on aircraft, as well as higher than expected effort to meet customer requirements in order to support delivery of the initial aircraft. In addition, in 2018, in connection with winning the T-X and MQ-25 Stingray competitions, we recorded a loss of $400 million associated with options for 346 T-X Trainer aircraft and a loss of $291 million related to the MQ-25 Stingray Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance. Fixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker , T-X Trainer, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25 Stingray, and commercial and military satellites. We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks. Our BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 35% and 23% of their 2018 revenues from cost-type contracting arrangements. Some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Programs whose contracts are primarily cost-type include GMD , Proprietary and SLS programs. We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks. Contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit payments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite does not perform to specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance. The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees we ultimately expect to realize is recognized as revenue in the construction period. If the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criteria, customers will not be obligated to continue making in-orbit payments and/or we may be required to provide refunds to the customer and incur significant charges. Our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance and financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components. We rely on other companies including U.S. and non-U.S. subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies, and production commodities and to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences financial difficulties, delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers or incur additional costs. For example, the 737 program experienced supply chain disruptions in 2018 that impacted the timing of certain deliveries during the year. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum, titanium or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the suppliers control, such as geo-political developments, or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs. We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results. Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. With respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling and other non-recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes to price escalation indices, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer and supplier negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact these estimates. Any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under Managements Discussion and Analysis  Critical Accounting Policies  Contract Accounting/Program Accounting on pages 43  44 and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 54  66 of this Form 10-K. Competition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell may reduce our future contracts and sales. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasing competition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers of commercial jet aircraft. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation, fewer large and new programs and new priorities, including near and long-term cost competitiveness, of our U.S. DoD and non-U.S. customers will intensify competition for many of our BDS products. Our BGS segment faces competition from many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not result in reduced revenues and market share. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries. In 2018 , non-U.S. customers, which includes FMS, accounted for approximately 56% of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including: ##TABLE_START  changes in regulatory requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  U.S. and non-U.S. government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  fluctuations in international currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  volatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  imposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with a variety of non-U.S. laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international tensions and conflicts. ##TABLE_END While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future. Unauthorized access to our or our customers information and systems could negatively impact our business. We face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address these threats. While these measures are designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems, certain types of attacks, including cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information and information technology systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we cannot prevent the unauthorized access, release and/or corruption of our customers confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or we could face financial losses. The outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. We are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits, or future lawsuits, could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the United States and its various states, as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S. government, the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our current or past ownership of certain property. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks. A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft, and among customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position could be materially adversely affected. We may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , our airplane financing commitments totaled $19,462 million and $10,221 million . If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures. As part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. For example, in 2018 we completed the acquisition of KLX Inc., a provider of aviation parts and services. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful. We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures. We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. We maintain insurance for certain risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. government. The amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft technologies, missile systems, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims or liabilities. Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses. Our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. Any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of our data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and of our products and services. Some of our and our suppliers workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages. Approximately 54,000 employees, which constitute 35% of our total workforce, were union represented as of December 31, 2018 . We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BDS program production. We may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 11 U.S. labor organizations and 13 non-U.S. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions requirements without impacting our financial condition. The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations. Substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders equity and cash flows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods. The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and discretionary contributions to improve the plans ' funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders ' equity. For U.S. government contracts, we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. We also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the level of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see  Management ' s Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies - Pension Plans  on page 45 of this Form 10-K. Although Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) expense and pension or other postretirement benefit contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. We are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or past manufacturing operations or the operations of companies we have acquired. In other cases, we may become subject to such costs due to an indemnification agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental liabilities. In addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation requirements could result in additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. ", "1B": " Item 1B.

BCA revenues increased by $2,701 million due to higher 737 and 787 deliveries and favorable 737 and 787 model mix, which more than offset lower 777 and 747 deliveries . BDS revenues increased by $2,634 million primarily due to non-US contract awards for fighters, higher weapons revenue, the final C-17 aircraft sale and higher satellites revenue . BGS revenues increased by $2,437 million due to growth across our services portfolio, primarily driven by higher parts revenue including the acquisition of KLX Inc. (KLX). The increases at BCA, BDS, and BGS were partially offset by lower unallocated revenue. Revenues in 2017 increased by $509 million or 1% compared with 2016. BDS revenues increased by $381 million primarily due to higher weapons revenue. BGS revenues increased by $762 million primarily due to higher commercial parts revenue. The increases at BDS and BGS were partially offset by lower BCA revenues, primarily due to delivery mix, with fewer twin aisle deliveries more than offsetting the impact of higher single aisle deliveries . The changes in Unallocated items, eliminations and other in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 primarily reflect the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries and the sale of aircraft previously leased to customers.

See page 40 . ##TABLE_END Earnings from operations in 2018 increased by $1,643 million compared with 2017 , primarily due to higher earnings at BCA and BGS, which more than offset the decrease at BDS and the change in Unallocated items, eliminations and other. BCA earnings from operations increased by $2,427 million in 2018 due to higher revenues and improved operating margins. The increase in operating margins is primarily due to higher 787 margins, improved cost performance and favorable delivery mix. BGS earnings from operations increased by $276 million in 2018 primarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by higher period costs . BDS earnings from operations in 2018 decreased by $599 million compared with 2017 as earnings growth from higher revenues was more than offset by charges of $691 million related to winning the T-X Trainer and MQ-25 competitions, as well as $199 million of higher KC-46A Tanker reach-forward losses . Earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $3,817 million compared with 2016 due to higher earnings at BCA and BDS, partially offset by the change in Unallocated items, eliminations and other. BCA earnings from operations increased by $3,471 million in 2017 primarily due to lower reach-forward losses, lower research and development costs, and improved margins reflecting favorable cost performance. In 2016, BCA recorded reach-forward losses of $1,258 million on the 747 program and reclassified $1,235 million of 787 flight test aircraft inventory costs to research and development. The reclassification of flight test aircraft costs was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of our determination that two 787 flight test aircraft were no longer commercially saleable. BDS earnings from operations increased by $515 million in 2017 primarily due to lower charges on the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew programs. During 2018, 2017 and 2016 , we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker program. In 2018 , we recorded charges of $736 million , of which $500 million was recorded at BCA, $222 million at BDS , and $14 million at BGS. During 2017 , we recorded charges of $445 million : $378 million at BCA, $44 million at BGS, and $23 million at BDS. During 2016 , we recorded charges of $1,127 million : $772 million at BCA and $351 million at BDS. Core operating earnings for 2018 increased by $1,754 million compared with 2017 primarily due to higher earnings at BCA and BGS, partially offset by lower earnings at BDS and higher unallocated expenses. Core operating earnings in 2017 increased by $3,736 million compared with 2016 primarily due to higher earnings at BCA and BDS. Unallocated Items, Eliminations and Other The most significant items included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other are shown in the following table: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Share-based plans ($76 )  ($77 )  ($66 ) Deferred compensation (19 )  (240 )  (46 ) Eliminations and other unallocated items (1,319 )  (782 )  (595 ) Unallocated items, eliminations and other ($1,414 )  ($1,099 )  ($707 ) ##TABLE_ENDDeferred compensation expense decreased by $221 million in 2018 and increased by $194 million in 2017, primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions and our stock price. Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $537 million in 2018 primarily due to timing of expense allocations, higher research and development expense and a $148 million charge incurred related to the outcome of the Spirit litigation. See the discussion in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $187 million in 2017 primarily due to the timing of expense allocations. A portion of service cost is recognized in Earnings from operations in the period incurred and the remainder is included in inventory at the end of the reporting period and recorded in Earnings from operations in subsequent periods. Net periodic pension benefit costs included in Earnings from operations were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Pension Years ended December 31,   Allocated to business segments ($1,318 )  ($1,637 )  ($2,286 ) Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment 1,005  1,127  1,029 Net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations ($313 )  ($510 )  ($1,257 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in earnings in 2018, 2017, and 2016 were largely consistent across all periods. The decrease in net periodic benefit costs included in Earnings from operations in 2017 was primarily due to lower service costs reflecting the transition of employees in 2016 to defined contribution retirement savings plans. For additional discussion related to Postretirement Plans, see Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Earnings Items ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Earnings from operations $11,987  $10,344  $6,527 Other income/(loss), net   (438 ) Interest and debt expense (475 )  (360 )  (306 ) Earnings before income taxes 11,604  10,107  5,783 Income tax expense (1,144 )  (1,649 )  (749 ) Net earnings from continuing operations $10,460  $8,458  $5,034 ##TABLE_ENDOther income/(loss), net decreased by $31 million in 2018 primarily due to lower gains from foreign exchange, partially offset by higher interest income. Other income/(loss), net increased by $561 million in 2017 primarily due to a decrease in non-operating pension and postretirement costs and higher gains from foreign exchange. The non-operating pension expense included in Other income/(loss), net was a benefit of $143 million in 2018 and $117 million in 2017 , compared with an expense of $327 million in 2016 . The benefits in 2018 and 2017 reflect expected returns in excess of interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses. The expense in 2016 reflects the amortization of non-service costs previously capitalized as inventory in prior years, primarily interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses in excess of expected returns. Interest and debt expense increased by $115 million in 2018 as a result of higher debt balances and lower capitalized interest and increased by $54 million in 2017 as a result of lower capitalized interest. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Total Costs and Expenses (Cost of Sales) Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our BCA segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. For long-term contracts, the amount reported as cost of sales is recognized as incurred. Substantially all contracts at our BDS segment, certain military derivative aircraft contracts at BCA and certain contracts at our BGS segment are long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Costs on these contracts are recorded as incurred. The following table summarizes cost of sales: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31  Change   Change Cost of sales $81,490  $76,612 $4,878  $76,612  $79,026 ($2,414 ) Cost of sales as a % of revenues 80.6 %  81.5 % (0.9 %)  81.5 %  84.5 % (3.0 )% ##TABLE_ENDCost of sales in 2018 increased by $4,878 million , or 6% , compared with 2017 , primarily due to higher revenue and higher reach-forward losses at BCA and BDS. Cost of sales in 2017 decreased by $2,414 million , or 3% , compared with 2016, primarily due to lower reach-forward losses at BCA and BDS. Research and Development The following table summarizes our Research and development expense: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)      Years ended December 31,   Commercial Airplanes $2,188  $2,247  $3,706 Defense, Space  Security   Global Services   Other  (42 )  (48 ) Total $3,269  $3,179  $4,626 ##TABLE_ENDResearch and development expense in 2018 increased by $90 million compared with 2017 due to investment in product development, partially offset by lower spending on 777X and 787-10. Research and development expense in 2017 decreased by $1,447 million compared with 2016 primarily due to the reclassification of $1,235 million of costs from inventory in the second quarter of 2016 related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft as well as lower spending on the 737 MAX, 787-10, and 777X. Backlog Our backlog at December 31 was as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)    Years ended December 31,  Commercial Airplanes $412,307  $410,986 Defense, Space  Security 57,166  44,049 Global Services 21,008  19,605 Total Backlog $490,481  $474,640     Contractual backlog 462,070  456,984 Unobligated backlog 28,411  $17,656 Total Backlog $490,481  $474,640 ##TABLE_ENDContractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog during 2018 was primarily due to BDS orders and funding for contract awards in excess of revenue recognized. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The increase in unobligated backlog in 2018 was primarily due to contract awards, partially offset by reclassifications to contractual backlog related to BDS and BGS contracts. Additional Considerations KC-46A Tanker In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force ( USAF ) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. In 2016, following our achievement of key flight testing milestones, the USAF authorized two LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at $2.8 billion, and in 2017, the USAF authorized an additional LRIP lot for 15 aircraft valued at $2.1 billion. On September 10, 2018, the USAF authorized an additional LRIP lot for 18 aircraft valued at $2.9 billion. The contract contains production options for both LRIP aircraft and full rate production aircraft. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. In January 2019, we delivered the first KC-46A Tanker to the USAF . During 2016, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,127 million related to the EMD contract and LRIP aircraft. During 2017, we recorded reach-forward losses of $445 million related to this program, primarily reflecting higher estimated costs associated with certification and incorporating changes into LRIP aircraft. During 2018, we recorded additional reach-forward losses of $736 million primarily reflecting higher estimated costs associated with certification, flight testing and change incorporation on aircraft, as well as higher than expected effort to meet customer requirements in order to support delivery of the initial aircraft. As with any development program, this program remains subject to additional reach-forward losses and/or delivery delays if we experience further production, technical or quality issues, and delays in flight testing, certification and/or delivery. Export-Import Bank of the United States Many of our non-U.S. customers finance purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the banks charter on June 30, 2015, the banks charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the banks board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. Certain of our non-U.S. customers also may seek to delay purchases if they cannot obtain financing at reasonable costs, and there may be further impacts with respect to future sales campaigns involving non-U.S. customers. We continue to work with our customers to mitigate risks associated with the lack of a quorum of the banks board of directors and assist with alternative third party financing sources. Global Trade On June 1, 2018, the U.S. Government began imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In response to these tariffs, several major U.S. trading partners have imposed, or announced their intention to impose, tariffs on U.S. goods. We continue to monitor the potential for any extra costs that may result from these actions. On July 6, 2018, the U.S. and China began imposing tariffs on approximately $34 billion of each other's exports. Certain aircraft parts and components that Boeing procures are subject to these tariffs. Subsequently, the U.S. imposed tariffs on an additional $216 billion in Chinese goods, and China imposed tariffs on an additional $76 billion worth of U.S goods. On December 1, 2018, the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day timetable to negotiate a resolution to the trade dispute. We continue to monitor the potential for any disruption and adverse revenue and/or cost impacts that may result from these actions or future geopolitical economic developments. The U.S. Government continues to impose and/or threaten to impose sanctions on certain businesses and individuals in Russia. Although our operations or sales in Russia have not been impacted to date, we continue to monitor additional sanctions that may be imposed by the U.S. Government and any responses from Russia that could affect our supply chain, business partners or customers. Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment Global economic growth, a primary driver for air travel, was above the long-term average of approximately 3% in 2018. Passenger traffic is estimated to grow by 6.5% in 2018, exceeding the long-term average of approximately 5%. While growth was strong across all major world regions, there continues to be variation between regions and airline business models. Airlines operating in Asia Pacific, Europe and North America, as well as low-cost-carriers globally, are currently leading the growth in passenger traffic. Air cargo traffic growth is expected to be between 4.0% and 4.5% in 2018, around the long-term average. Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also focusing on reducing costs and renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airplanes. Net profits in 2018 are expected to approximate $32 billion. The long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast projects a long-term average growth rate of 4.7% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.8% average annual GDP growth, we project a $6.3 trillion market for approximately 42,700 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global environmental regulations. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Market liberalization in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is enabling low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 88% of Commercial Airplanes total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers, Embraer and Bombardier, continue to develop and market larger and increasingly more capable airplanes. During 2018, Airbus acquired a majority share of Bombardiers C Series (now A220) and is in the 100-150 seat transcontinental market, while Embraers first E195-E2 delivered in 2018. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft. Some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including launch aid, which greatly reduces the cost and commercial risks associated with airplane development activities. This has enabled the development of airplanes without commercial viability; others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible; and many offered for sale below market-based prices. Many competitors have continued to make improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share and improving earnings. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. We are focused on improving our products and services and continuing our cost-reduction efforts, which enhances our ability to compete. We are also focused on taking actions to ensure that Boeing is not harmed by unfair subsidization of competitors.

BCA revenues decreased by $1,364 million or 2% in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to delivery mix, with fewer twin aisle deliveries more than offsetting the impact of higher single aisle deliveries . Commercial Airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  *  *  Total           Cumulative deliveries 7,312  1,548  1,133  1,582   Deliveries (18)   (10)   806           Cumulative deliveries 6,732  1,542  1,106  1,534   Deliveries (17)  (1)    763           Cumulative deliveries 6,203  1,528  1,096  1,460   Deliveries (19)  (3)    748 ##TABLE_END* Intercompany deliveries identified by parentheses  Aircraft accounted for as revenues by BCA and as operating leases in consolidation identified by parentheses Earnings From Operations Earnings from operations in 2018 increased by $2,427 million compared with 2017 . The increase in operating earnings reflects higher revenues and improved operating margins. The increase in operating margins is primarily due to higher 787 margins, improved cost performance and favorable delivery mix. Earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $3,471 million compared with 2016 . The increase in operating earnings and operating margins is primarily due to lower reach-forward losses, lower research and development costs, and improved margins reflecting favorable cost performance, which more than offset the impact of lower revenues. Research and development expense in 2016 reflects the reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of $1,235 million related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft and higher planned spending related to the 777X program. Reach-forward losses of $500 million , $378 million and $772 million were recorded related to the KC-46A Tanker in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. During 2016 , we recorded reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258 million. Backlog Our total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations to our customers where we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Backlog excludes options and BCC orders. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. The value of orders in backlog is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). BCA total backlog of $412,307 million at December 31, 2018 increased from $410,986 million at December 31, 2017, primarily due to net orders in excess of deliveries. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a programs life. Estimation of each programs accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. ##TABLE_START  Program    747*    777X               Program accounting quantities 10,400  1,574  1,195  1,680  **  1,600  Undelivered units under firm orders 4,708 (75)    (2)   (30)  Cumulative firm orders 12,020 (75)  1,572  1,244  1,682 (2)   1,385 (30)        Program accounting quantities 9,800  1,570  1,171  1,625  **  1,400  Undelivered units under firm orders*** 4,613       Cumulative firm orders*** 11,345  1,554  1,204  1,631   1,276        Program accounting quantities 9,000  1,555  1,159  1,625  **  1,300  Undelivered units under firm orders*** 4,452       Cumulative firm orders*** 10,655  1,556  1,189  1,596   1,200  ##TABLE_END Aircraft ordered by BCC are identified in parentheses. * At December 31, 2018 , the 747 accounting quantity includes one already completed aircraft that has not been sold and is being remarketed. ** The accounting quantity for the 777X will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020. *** Cumulative firm orders adjusted to reflect the adoption of Topic 606 in the first quarter of 2018. Program Highlights 737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 600 units during 2018 due to the program  s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We delivered the first 737 MAX 8 in May 2017, announced the launch of the 737 MAX 10 in June 2017 and delivered the first 737 MAX 9 in March 2018. The production rate increased from 47 per month to 52 per month in the second quarter of 2018, however the timing of deliveries in 2018 was adversely affected by delays in the supply chain. We continue to plan to increase the production rate to 57 per month in 2019. 747 Program During the fourth quarter of 2018, we received a firm order for 4 new aircraft and increased the accounting quantity by 4 units to 1,574 aircraft. The program accounting quantity now includes aircraft scheduled to be produced through 2022. We are currently producing at a rate of 0.5 aircraft per month having reduced the rate from 1.0 per month in September 2016. In 2016, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,258 million as lower than expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower than expected growth of global freight traffic resulted in lower anticipated revenues from future sales and higher costs to produce fewer airplanes. We continue to evaluate the viability of the 747 program. We believe that a decision to end production of the 747 at the end of the current accounting quantity would not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 24 units during the first quarter of 2018 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. We are currently producing at a rate of 2.5 per month and plan to increase to 3 per month in 2020. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 55 units during 2018 due to the programs normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 5 per month. In 2013, we launched the 777X, which features a new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips. The 777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020. 787 Program The accounting quantity for the 787 program increased by 200 units during 2018 due to the programs normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 12 per month and plan to increase to 14 per month in 2019. We delivered the first 787-10 in March 2018. Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1.0% of total consolidated costs of products and services. Program Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. ##TABLE_START Go-ahead and Initial Delivery                  737 MAX 7                      737 MAX 8                      737 MAX 9                      737 MAX 10                      787-10                      777X                      ##TABLE_ENDReflects models in development during 2018 We launched the 737 MAX 7, 8 and 9 in August 2011 and the 737 MAX 10 in June 2017. We launched the 787-10 in June 2013 and the 777X in November 2013. Additional Considerations The development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Defense, Space  Security Business Environment and Trends United States Government Defense Environment Overview The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, passed in February 2018, raised the 2011 Budget Control Act spending caps for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 (FY18 and FY19). The consolidated spending bills signed into law in September 2018 provide defense funding for FY19, in compliance with the revised caps. These bills also provide FY19 appropriations for most of the federal government. Full year funding for the departments and agencies not covered by enacted FY19 appropriations, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), remains uncertain. The unfunded departments and agencies affected by the partial government shutdown (December 22, 2018 through January 25, 2019) are now covered by a Continuing Resolution that extends funding at FY18 levels through February 15, 2019. Congress and the President must agree to FY19 appropriations or an additional Continuing Resolution to fund affected departments and agencies beyond the February 15 deadline in order to prevent a second partial government shutdown. The impact of a partial government shutdown to the Companys operations would increase as the shutdown continues. There continues to be uncertainty with respect to future program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, including NASA. The 2011 Budget Control Act continues to mandate limits on U.S. government discretionary spending for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (FY20 and FY21). The lower budget caps will take effect again in FY20 and FY21 unless Congress acts to raise the spending caps or to repeal or suspend the law. As a result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows.  Non-U.S. Defense Environment Overview The non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given the diverse regional threats. At the end of 2018, 30% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-U.S. customers.

In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Deliveries of units for new-build production aircraft, including remanufactures and modifications were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   F/A-18 Models   F-15 Models   C-17 Globemaster III   CH-47 Chinook (New)   CH-47 Chinook (Renewed)   AH-64 Apache (New)   AH-64 Apache (Remanufactured)   P-8 Models   C-40A   Total   ##TABLE_ENDNew-build satellite deliveries were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Commercial and civil satellites   Military satellites   ##TABLE_ENDRevenues BDS revenues in 2018 increased by $2,634 million compared with 2017 primarily due to non-US contract awards for fighters, higher weapons revenue, the final C-17 aircraft sale and higher satellites revenue . Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments to revenue for 2018 were $214 million lower than the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting increased unfavorable adjustments on the KC-46A Tanker recorded in 2018. BDS revenues in 2017 increased by $381 million compared with 2016 primarily due to higher weapons revenue. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments to revenue for 2017 were $81 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting decreased unfavorable adjustments on the KC-46A Tanker recorded in 2017. Earnings From Operations BDS earnings from operations in 2018 decreased by $599 million compared with 2017 as earnings growth from higher revenues was more than offset by charges of $691 million related to winning the T-X Trainer and MQ-25 competitions, as well as $199 million of higher KC-46A Tanker reach-forward losses . Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments to earnings for 2018 were $315 million lower than the comparable period in the prior year, driven by higher charges on development programs in 2018. BDS earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $515 million compared with 2016 primarily due to lower charges on the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew programs. Higher earnings reflect the favorable impact of cumulative catch-up adjustments which were $374 million higher in 2017 than in 2016, primarily driven by lower charges on development programs in 2017. BDS earnings from operations include equity earnings of $147 million , $183 million and $249 million primarily from our ULA and non-U.S. joint ventures in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. During 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , BDS recorded charges related to the KC-46A Tanker contract of $222 million , $23 million and $351 million , respectively. Backlog Total backlog of $57,166 million at December 31, 2018 increase d by 30% from $44,049 million at December 31, 2017 , primarily due to current year contract awards in many of our programs greater than revenue recognized. Significant orders included Satellites, F/A-18 fighters, Ground-based Midcourse Defense, weapons, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, V-22 Osprey, CH-47 Chinook, MQ-25 Stingray and T-X Trainer. Additional Considerations Our BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense , Proprietary and Space Launch System programs. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis and BDS customers are increasingly seeking fixed priced proposals for new programs. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, T-X Trainer, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25 Stingray, and commercial and military satellites. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. In the third quarter, we were awarded contracts to develop the T-X Trainer aircraft with complementary devices and the MQ-25 Stingray. We recorded orders of $1,618 million and recognized losses of $691 million associated with these contracts. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. KC-46A Tanker See the discussion of the KC-46A Tanker program on page 23 . United Launch Alliance See the discussion of Indemnifications to ULA and Financing Commitments in Notes 8 and 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Sea Launch See the discussion of the Sea Launch receivables in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Commercial Crew See the discussion of Fixed-Price Development Contracts in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. T-X Trainer In September 2018, we were selected by the U.S. Air Force to build the next generation training capability, known as T-X. The program includes aircraft and simulators as well as support and ground equipment. The contract is structured as an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) fixed-price contract with a minimum of 206 aircraft and a maximum of 475 aircraft. The EMD contract is a fixed-price contract valued at $813 million and includes five aircraft and seven simulators, with a period of performance that runs through 2022. The production and support contracts are structured as options that begin with authorization from fiscal year 2022 to 2034. In connection with winning this competition, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $400 million associated with anticipated losses on the options for 346 aircraft that we believe are probable of being exercised. We believe that our investment in this contract positions us for additional market opportunities for both trainer and light attack aircraft. MQ-25 Stingray In August 2018, we were awarded an EMD contract to build the MQ-25 Stingray for the U.S. Navy. The EMD contract is a fixed-price contract that includes development and delivery of four aircraft and test articles at a contract price of $805 million. In connection with winning this competition, we recognized a reach-forward loss of $291 million. The period of performance runs from 2018 through 2024. The MQ-25 Stingray is the U.S. Navys first operational carrier-based unmanned aircraft, and we believe that our investment in this contract positions us for long-term leadership in autonomy and artificial intelligence technologies along with additional market opportunities. Global Services Business Environment and Trends The aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics, and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering, and upgrades; training and professional services; and information services. We expect the market to grow by around 3.5% annually. As the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services designed to increase efficiency and extend the economic lives of airplanes. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve their productivity and efficiency. Airlines continue to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inventory, frequently outsourcing spares management to third parties. Government services market segments are growing on pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S. government services market is the single largest individual market, comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Over the next decade, we expect U.S. growth to remain flat and non-U.S. fleets, led by Middle East and Asia Pacific customers, to add rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft at the fastest rates. We expect less than 20 percent of the worldwide fleet of military aircraft to be retired and replaced over the next ten years, driving increased demand for services to maintain aging aircraft and enhance aircraft capability. BGS major customer, the U.S. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty described on page 30 , which could restrict the execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions. Industry Competitiveness Aviation services is a competitive market with many domestic and international competitors. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales growth potential and long-term investment returns.

Additional Considerations KLX See the discussion of the KLX acquisition in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements . Boeing Capital Business Environment and Trends BCCs gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2018 totaled $2,792 million . A substantial portion of BCCs portfolio is related to customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BCCs portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft. BCC provided customer financing of $601 million and $480 million during 2018 and 2017 . While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2019 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources. However, a number of factors could cause BCCs new business volume to increase further, including if the Export-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not, approve new financing transactions. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 1,700 western-built commercial jet aircraft (6.7% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2018 , including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 2% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2017 and 2016 , 8.3% and 8.8% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service.

BCC s revenues in 2018 decreased by $33 million compared with 2017 primarily due to lower lease income driven by a smaller portfolio, partially offset by gain on sale of assets. BCC s revenues in 2017 were consistent with 2016 . Earnings From Operations BCCs earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2018 decreased by $35 million primarily due to lower revenues. Earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $55 million primarily due to lower asset impairment and depreciation expenses. Financial Position The following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Customer financing and investment portfolio, net $2,790  $3,003 Other assets, primarily cash and short-term investments  Total assets $3,507  $3,680     Other liabilities, primarily deferred income taxes $523  $653 Debt, including intercompany loans 2,487  2,523 Equity  Total liabilities and equity $3,507  $3,680     Debt-to-equity ratio 5.0-to-1  5.0-to-1 ##TABLE_ENDBCC s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2018 decreased from December 31, 2017 , primarily due to $812 million of note payoffs, asset sales and portfolio run-off, partially offset by new volume. Aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $84 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2019 . We are seeking to remarket these aircraft or have the leases extended. BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment.

The increase of $2.0 billion in 2018 was primarily driven by higher earnings and lower spending on inventory, partially offset by lower advances. The increase of $2.9 billion in 2017 was primarily driven by higher advances more than offsetting inventory increases. Advances and progress billings increase d by $2.6 billion in 2018 , increase d by $4.7 billion in 2017 and decrease d by $1.3 billion in 2016 . During 2017, our discretionary contributions to our pension plans included $14.4 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $3.5 billion and $0.5 billion in cash. Discretionary contributions to our pension plans were insignificant in 2018 and 2016 . Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $4.6 billion , $2.1 billion and $3.4 billion primarily due to acquisitions during the second half of 2018 and the timing of investments. Acquisitions net of cash acquired were $3.2 billion in 2018 , compared with $0.3 billion in 2017 and 2016 . Capital expenditures totaled $1.7 billion in both 2018 and 2017 , down from $2.6 billion in 2016 . We expect capital expenditures in 2019 to be higher than 2018 . Net proceeds from investments was $0.3 billion in 2018 and insignificant in 2017 , compared with net contributions to investments of $0.5 billion in 2016. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $11.7 billion during 2018 , an increase of $0.4 billion compared with 2017 primarily due to higher dividend payments partially offset by higher net borrowings. Cash used by financing activities was $11.4 billion during 2017 , an increase of $1.8 billion compared with 2016 , primarily due to higher share repurchases and dividend payments. Net borrowings were $1.4 billion in 2018 , $1.1 billion in 2017 and insignificant in 2016 . At December 31, 2018 and 2017 the recorded balance of debt was $13.8 billion and $11.1 billion of which $3.2 billion and $1.3 billion was classified as short-term. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 this included $2.5 billion of debt attributable to BCC , of which $0.5 billion and $0.9 billion were classified as short-term. During 2018 and 2017 we repurchased 26.1 million and 46.1 million shares totaling $9.0 billion and $9.2 billion through our open market share repurchase program. In 2018 and 2017 , we had 0.7 million shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At December 31, 2018 , the amount available under the share repurchase plan, announced on December 17, 2018 , totaled $20 billion . Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that serves as a source of short-term liquidity. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , commercial paper borrowings totaling $1,895 million and $600 million , which were supported by unused commitments under the revolving credit agreement. We had no commercial paper borrowings in 2016. At December 31, 2018 , we had $5.1 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. Financing commitments totaled $19.5 billion and $10.2 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017 . The increase primarily relates to commercial airplane orders received in 2018. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In addition, many of our non-U.S. customers finance aircraft purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the banks charter on June 30, 2015, the banks charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the banks board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings under our commercial paper program or in the debt markets. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , our pension plans were $15.3 billion and $16.4 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) basis our plans are 96% funded at December 31, 2018 with minimal required contributions in 2019 . We do not expect to make contributions to our pension plans in 2019 . We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years. At December 31, 2018 , we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2018 , and the estimated timing thereof. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Total  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  3-5 years  After 5 years Long-term debt (including current portion) $13,932  $3,137  $1,927  $1,326  $7,542 Interest on debt 6,458     4,292 Pension and other postretirement cash requirements 14,379   1,627  5,050  7,096 Capital lease obligations     Operating lease obligations 1,850     Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position 126,693  51,784  41,470  22,649  10,790 Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position 19,900  19,076    Total contractual obligations (1) $183,376  $75,462  $47,138  $30,168  $30,608 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Excludes income tax matters. As of December 31, 2018 , our net liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions of $2,412 million , was $2,392 million . For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. ##TABLE_END Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, customer financing equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation. Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology or skills transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2018 , we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2018 , we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $18.4 billion that extend through 2030 . Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2018 . ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Total Amounts Committed/Maximum Amount of Loss  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  4-5 years  After 5 years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $3,761  $1,274  $1,703  $1  $783 Commercial aircraft financing commitments 19,462  2,331  6,216  5,189  5,726 Total commercial commitments $23,223  $3,605  $7,919  $5,190  $6,509 ##TABLE_ENDCommercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect to delivered aircraft, based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required, particularly if the Export-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not, provide new financing support. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contingent Obligations We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $555 million at December 31, 2018 . For additional information, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-GAAP Measures Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core earnings per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to BCA and certain BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. The Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in earnings during 2018 was a benefit of $1,005 million , largely consistent with a benefit of $1,127 million in 2017 and $1,029 million in 2016 . The non-operating pension expense included in Other income/(loss), net was a benefit of $143 million in 2018 and $117 million in 2017 , compared with an expense of $327 million in 2016 . The benefits in 2018 and 2017 reflect expected returns in excess of interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses. The expense in 2016 reflects the amortization of non-service costs previously capitalized as inventory in prior years, primarily interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses in excess of expected returns. For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see the Managements Discussion and Analysis on page 21 of this Form 10-K and see Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost, primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts. Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures The table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of earnings from operations, operating margins and diluted earnings per share. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except per share data)    Years ended December 31,   Revenues $101,127  $94,005  $93,496 Earnings from operations, as reported $11,987  $10,344  $6,527 Operating margins 11.9 %  11.0 %  7.0 %       Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment (1) ($1,005 )  ($1,127 )  ($1,029 ) Postretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment (1) ($322 )  ($311 )  ($328 ) FAS/CAS service cost adjustment (1) ($1,327 )  ($1,438 )  ($1,357 ) Core operating earnings (non-GAAP) $10,660  $8,906  $5,170 Core operating margins (non-GAAP) 10.5 %  9.5 %  5.5 %       Diluted earnings per share, as reported $17.85  $13.85  $7.83 Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment (1) ($1.71 )  ($1.84 )  ($1.60 ) Postretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment (1) ($0.55 )  ($0.51 )  ($0.51 ) Non-operating pension expense (2) ($0.24 ) ($0.19 ) $0.51 Non-operating postretirement expense (2) $0.17 $0.20 $0.23 Provision for deferred income taxes on adjustments (3) $0.49  $0.82  $0.48 Core earnings per share (non-GAAP) $16.01  $12.33  $6.94       Weighted average diluted shares (in millions) 586.2  610.7  643.8 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments.

Disclosure is required even if the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. In connection with the U.S. withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (Iran Nuclear Agreement), we engaged in activities during the third quarter that were required to unwind and terminate all agreements with Iranian airlines entered into prior to the withdrawal. These activities were authorized by a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and generated no revenues or profits. In addition, during the fourth quarter Iran Aseman Airlines requested Boeing support, and we replied that the current laws of the United States do not permit Boeing to provide any services, parts, or aircraft without a license from OFAC. Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for long-term contracts Substantially all contracts at BDS, certain military derivative aircraft contracts at BCA and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts. Our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide. Accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales, costs, and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales. Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the performance obligations inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016 net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all long-term contracts decreased Earnings from operations by $190 million and $263 million . For the year ended December 31, 2017 , net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all long-term contracts increased Earnings from operations by $250 million . Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all long-term contract performance obligations for all of 2018 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $297 million . In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. For example, in 2016, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $1,258 million on the 747 program. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 and 777X programs, typically have lower initial margins than established programs. In addition, actual costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity are included within program inventory as deferred production costs. Deferred production, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements are realized. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins. If the combined gross margin percentages for our commercial airplane programs had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would have a similar effect on the Commercial Airplane segments operating margins. For the year ended December 31, 2018 , a 1% increase or decrease in operating margins for our Commercial Airplane segment would have a $607 million impact on operating earnings. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any. We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2018 and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2018 , we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , we had $490 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets. Pension Plans The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional union employees transitioned to company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders equity. The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2018 . ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Change in discount rate Increase 25 bps  Change in discount rate Decrease 25 bps Pension plans    Projected benefit obligation ($1,947 )  $2,408 Net periodic pension cost (30 )  ##TABLE_ENDPension cost is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2018 net periodic pension cost by $154 million . ", "7A": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2018 , the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2018 , a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $262 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. ", "8": " Item 8.

The Boeing Company and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as Boeing, the Company, we, us, or our). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As described in Note 23 , effective July 1, 2017, we now operate in four reportable segments: Commercial Airplanes (BCA); Defense, Space  Security (BDS), Global Services (BGS), and Boeing Capital (BCC). Amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Operating Cycle For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year . Standards Issued and Implemented In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs): ASU 2014-09 , Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606); ASU 2017-07 , Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost; ASU 2016-18 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash; ASU 2018-02 , Income StatementReporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The impact of the adoption of these standards to our Consolidated Financial Statements is presented in Note 2 and the additional disclosures are shown in Notes 9 and 23 . ASU 2014-09 In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09 , Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , using the full retrospective method. Topic 606 requires revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Most of our defense contracts at our BDS and BGS segments and certain military derivative aircraft contracts at our BCA segment now recognize revenue under the new standard as costs are incurred. Under previous GAAP, revenue was generally recognized when deliveries were made, performance milestones were attained, or as costs were incurred. The new standard accelerates the timing of when the revenue is recognized, however, it does not change the total amount of revenue recognized on these contracts. The new standard does not affect revenue recognition or the use of program accounting for commercial airplane contracts in our BCA business. We continue to recognize revenue for these contracts at the point in time when the customer accepts delivery of the airplane. The adoption resulted in a cumulative adjustment to increase Retained earnings by $ 901 at January 1, 2016, an increase of $ 139 to Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016, and an increase of $ 261 to Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017. ASU 2017-07 In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-07 , Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost . The standard requires non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost to be presented in non-operating earnings using a retrospective transition method. We applied a practical expedient as the estimation basis for the reclassification of prior period non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost from Earnings from operations to Other income/(loss), net. Through the end of 2017, a portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense was not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it was allocated to production as product costs, and reflected in inventory at the end of the reporting periods. Effective January 1, 2018, in accordance with our adoption of ASU 2017-07, only service costs may be allocated to production costs and capitalized in inventory on a prospective basis. The impact of adoption was not material. ASU 2016-18 In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-18 , Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. The standard requires companies to include restricted amounts with Cash  cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end of period total amounts shown on the Statements of Cash Flows. The impact of adoption was not material. ASU 2018-02 In the first quarter of 2018, we early adopted ASU 2018-02 , Income StatementReporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The standard allows companies to reclassify from Accumulated other comprehensive income/loss to Retained earnings the difference between the historical corporate income tax rate of 35% and the 21% rate enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in December 2017. This resulted in an increase of $ 2,997 to Retained earnings and an increase of $ 2,997 to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Revenue and Related Cost Recognition Commercial aircraft contracts The majority of our BCA segment revenue is derived from commercial aircraft contracts. For each contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction price to each commercial aircraft performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. Revenue is recognized for each commercial aircraft performance obligation at the point in time when the aircraft is completed and accepted by the customer. We use program accounting to determine the amount reported as cost of sales. Where an aircraft is still in our possession, and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer (known as a bill-and-hold arrangement), revenue will be recognized when all specific requirements for transfer of control under a bill-and-hold arrangement have been met. Payments for commercial aircraft sales are received in accordance with the customer agreement, which generally includes a deposit upon order and additional payments in accordance with a payment schedule, with the balance being due immediately prior to or at aircraft delivery. Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities) are normal and customary for commercial aircraft contracts and not considered a significant financing component as they are intended to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. Long-term contracts Substantially all contracts at BDS , certain military derivative aircraft contracts at BCA and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Products sales under long-term contracts primarily include fighter jets, rotorcraft, cybersecurity products, surveillance suites, advanced weapons, missile defense, military derivative aircraft, satellite systems, and modification of commercial passenger aircraft to cargo freighters. Services sales under long-term contracts primarily include support and maintenance agreements associated with our commercial and defense products and space travel on Commercial Crew. For each long-term contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service, or a collection of goods and/or services, based on the relative standalone selling prices. A long-term contract will typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide. While the scope and price on certain long-term contracts may be modified over their life, the transaction price is based on current rights and obligations under the contract and does not include potential modifications until they are agreed upon with the customer. When applicable, a cumulative adjustment or separate recognition for the additional scope and price may result. Long-term contracts can be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing the price for contracts with the U.S. government. Certain long-term contracts include in the transaction price variable consideration, such as incentive and award fees, if specified targets are achieved. The amount included in the transaction price represents the expected value, based on a weighted probability, or the most likely amount. Long-term contract revenue is recognized over the contract term (over time) as the work progresses, either as products are produced or as services are rendered. We generally recognize revenue over time as we perform on long-term contracts because of continuous transfer of control to the customer. For U.S. government contracts, this continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in process. Similarly, for non-U.S. government contracts, the customer typically controls the work in process as evidenced either by contractual termination clauses or by our rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on products or services that do not have an alternative use to the Company. The accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales , costs and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred. The amount reported as revenues is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales. Recognizing revenue as costs are incurred provides an objective measure of progress on the long-term contract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a long-term contracts percentage-of-completion. When the current estimates of total sales and costs for a long-term contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire reach-forward loss on the long-term contract is recognized. Net cumulative catch-up adjustments to prior years' revenue and earnings, including certain reach-forward losses, across all long-term contracts were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Increase to Revenue $ 137  $ 559  $ 394 Increase/(decrease) to Earnings from Operations ($ 190 )  $ 250  ($ 263 ) Increase/(decrease) to Diluted EPS ($ 0.29 )  $ 0.34  ($ 0.36 ) ##TABLE_ENDSignificant adjustments during the three years ended December 31, 2018 included reach-forward losses of $ 736 , $ 445 and $ 1,127 on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract recorded during 2018, 2017 and 2016. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. Payments under long-term contracts may be received before or after revenue is recognized. The U.S. government customer typically withholds payment of a small portion of the contract price until contract completion. Therefore, long-term contracts typically generate Unbilled receivables (contract assets) but may generate Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities). Long-term contract Unbilled receivables and Advances and progress billings are not considered a significant financing component because they are intended to protect either the customer or the Company in the event that some or all of the obligations under the contract are not completed. Commercial spare parts contracts Certain contracts at our BGS segment include sales of commercial spare parts. For each contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. The spare parts have discrete unit prices that represent fair value. We generally consider each spare part to be a separate performance obligation. Revenue is recognized for each commercial spare part performance obligation at the point in time of delivery to the customer. We may provide our customers with a right to return a commercial spare part where a customer may receive a full or partial refund, a credit applied to amounts owed, a different product in exchange, or any combination of these items. We consider the potential for customer returns in the estimated transaction price. The amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost. Payments for commercial spare parts sales are typically received shortly after delivery. Other service revenue contracts Certain contracts at our BGS segment are for sales of services to commercial customers including maintenance, training, data analytics and information-based services. We recognize revenue for these service performance obligations over time as the services are rendered. The method of measuring progress (such as straight-line or billable amount) varies depending upon which method best depicts the transfer of control to the customer based on the type of service performed. Cost of sales is recorded as incurred. Concession Sharing Arrangements We account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their purchase of products and services as a reduction of the transaction price and the revenue that is recognized for the related performance obligations. The sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendors products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products. Unbilled Receivables and Advances and Progress Billings Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the Company recognizes revenue for amounts which cannot yet be billed under terms of the contract with the customer. Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities) arise when the Company receives payments from customers in advance of recognizing revenue. The amount of Unbilled receivables or Advances and progress billings is determined for each contract . Financial Services Revenue We record financial services revenue associated with sales-type/finance leases, operating leases, and notes receivable. Lease and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type/finance leases, we record an asset at lease inception. This asset is recorded at the aggregate of future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur. For operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets, included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated residual value, using the straight-line method. We periodically review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense. For notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note. Reinsurance Revenue Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Astro Ltd., participates in a reinsurance pool for workers compensation. The member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $ 145 , $ 141 and $ 147 during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were $ 136 , $ 144 and $ 139 during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Revenues and costs are presented net in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fleet Support We provide assistance and support to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation to the operators of all our commercial airplane models. Collectively known as fleet support, these activities and support services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering support, and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, and technical consulting support. This activity continues throughout the aircrafts operational life. Services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire models fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services. Research and Development Research and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design, and testing, as well as bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers. Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with our contract accounting policy. We have certain research and development arrangements that meet the requirement for best efforts research and development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expense rather than as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of $ 234 , $ 288 and $ 311 in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Share-Based Compensation We provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value net of estimated forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. Income Taxes Provisions for U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Earnings before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. Tax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of Income tax expense. Postretirement Plans The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. We also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employees annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). A portion of the service cost component of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and reflected in inventory at the end of a reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in Shareholders equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities we amortize them over the average future service period of employees. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Postemployment Plans We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated. Environmental Remediation We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations, and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup, and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be able to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable were $ 127 and $ 116 at December 31, 2018 and 2017 . Inventories Inventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe benefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries and plant services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costs include amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one year. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering. Commercial aircraft programs inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production costs represent actual costs incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costs are experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor and other resources) than units produced later in a program because of volume efficiencies and the effects of learning. We expect that these deferred costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive from suppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier advances are amortized to work in process. The determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision is recorded. The determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimate revenue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity. When estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. Used aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value. See Aircraft Valuation within this Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or net realizable value. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired inventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs. Included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the ability to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwise recoverable, it would be written off in the current period. Precontract Costs We may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recovery from future orders, then we capitalize the precontract costs we incur, excluding start-up costs which are expensed as incurred. Capitalized precontract costs are included in Inventories in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Should future orders not materialize or we determine the costs are no longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and equipment, from 4 to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over 5 years. Capitalized software as a service is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over the term of the hosting arrangement which is typically no greater than 5 years. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition. Long-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Long-lived assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Asset Retirement Obligations We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material. We also have known conditional asset retirement obligations, such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liabilitys fair value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1. We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology, from 4 to 14 years; product know-how, from 6 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 17 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 27 years; and other, from 2 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Investments Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost. Available-for-sale debt securities include commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recognized based on the specific identification method. Available-for-sale debt securities are assessed for impairment quarterly. The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between 20 % and 50 % . The cumulative earnings approach is used for cash flow classification of distributions received from equity method investments. Other Equity investments are recorded at fair value, with gains and losses recorded through net earnings. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at cost, less impairments, plus or minus observable price changes. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value are assessed for impairment quarterly. We classify investment income and loss on our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on whether the investment is operating or non-operating in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, including our share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from other equity investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic purposes. Earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on marketable securities, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in Other income/(loss), net. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them. We use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes in fair value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is to include in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For our cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss of a cash flow hedge is reported in earnings immediately. We have agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives and international business requirements. These agreements are derivatives for accounting purposes but are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We also hold certain derivative instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For these aluminum agreements and for other derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings immediately. Aircraft Valuation Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments. Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of: ##TABLE_START (1) adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recognized upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) charges to cost of products for adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in Accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_END The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customers requirements; or the scrap market. Trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market or using current published third-party aircraft valuations based on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individual attributes and known conditions. Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer financing. Customer financing Customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/finance leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary. We assess the fair value of the assets we own, including equipment under operating leases, assets held for sale or re-lease, and collateral underlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are less than the related assets carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fair values of sales-type/finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables. We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications. Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Allowance for losses on customer financing receivables We record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in a valuation account, the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to two components of receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables. We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the receivable agreement, without regard to any subsequent restructurings. Factors considered in assessing collectability include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. We determine a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral we would expect to realize. We review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables (after excluding receivables subject to a specific impairment allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for each customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, for example, permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall. Each quarter we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables. Warranties In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material and design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a 3 to 4 -year standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards under our authorization. These warranties are included in the programs estimate at completion. On occasion we have made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warranties issued by our BDS segment principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons hardware and are included in the contract cost estimates. These sales are generally accompanied by a six month to two -year warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product delivery occurs. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate. We provide guarantees to certain commercial airplane customers which include compensation provisions for failure to meet specified aircraft performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets, and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of the related aircraft. We have agreements that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to customers for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as a reduction in Cost of products at delivery of the related aircraft. These performance warranties and claims against suppliers are included in the programs estimate at completion. Supplier Penalties We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully anticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts. Guarantees We record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. For credit guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditors default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable, for each future period the credit guarantee will be outstanding. If at inception of a guarantee, we determine there is a probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value of the guarantee as described above or (b) the probable contingent loss amount. Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016 - 02, Leases (Topic 842) . The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The standard will require lessees to report most leases as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, while lessor accounting will remain substantially unchanged. The standard permits two approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new guidance with restatement of prior years, and one requiring prospective application of the new guidance. We plan to adopt the new lease standard effective January 1, 2019 and apply it prospectively. We do not expect the new lease standard to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Note 2 - Impact of Adoption of New Standards In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted the following ASUs: ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606); ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost; ASU 2016-18 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Restricted Cash; and ASU 2018-02 Income StatementReporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.

On October 9, 2018, we acquired all the outstanding shares of KLX Inc. (KLX). KLX is a global provider of aviation parts and services in the aerospace industry. Its capabilities include distribution and supply chain services. The KLX acquisition is intended to accelerate growth in our services business by allowing Boeing to offer commercial, defense, business and general aviation customers a broader range of offerings. The results of KLXs operations have been included in our Global Services segment from the acquisition date. KLXs revenues and earnings from operations from October 9, 2018 through December 31, 2018 were $ 356 and $ 50 . The preliminary allocation of the purchase price was as follows: ##TABLE_START Cash and cash equivalents $ 225 Accounts receivable Inventories 1,321 Other current assets Property, plant  equipment Goodwill 2,110 Intangible assets Other assets Current liabilities ( 347 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 180 ) Long-term debt ( 1,210 ) Total net assets acquired $ 3,286 ##TABLE_ENDThe goodwill has been allocated to the Global Services and Commercial Airplanes segments based on revenue synergies expected to be realized from the integration of KLXs products and services and expected cost synergies primarily resulting from the consolidation of procurement spending and functional support. Approximately $ 533 of the acquired goodwill and intangible assets is deductible for tax purposes. The acquired intangible assets primarily relate to customer and supplier relationships and have a weighted-average useful life of 17.5 years . Strategic Partnership with Embraer On July 5, 2018, we and Embraer S.A. (Embraer) announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a strategic partnership between the two companies. On December 17, 2018, the terms of the strategic partnership were agreed by both companies. The agreed terms define the joint venture comprising the commercial aircraft and services operations of Embraer, in which Boeing will acquire an 80 percent ownership stake for $ 4.2 billion . The companies have also agreed to the terms of another joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the multi-mission medium airlift KC-390, in which Boeing will hold a 49 percent ownership stake. On January 10, 2019, the Government of Brazil reviewed the terms of the strategic partnership and advised it would not exercise its Golden Share veto power, allowing the transaction to move forward. On January 11, 2019, the Embraer Board of Directors ratified its prior approval of the strategic partnership and authorized execution of the definitive transaction documents. On January 24, 2019, the definitive transaction documents were executed. The transaction remains subject to Embraer shareholder and regulatory approvals, as well as other customary closing conditions. Assuming approvals are received in a timely manner, the transaction is intended to close by the end of 2019 . If the transaction is not completed due to failure to obtain antitrust approvals, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $ 100 .

Note 5  Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earnings per share for common shares and participating securities. The undistributed earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed earnings. Basic earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. The elements used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In millions - except per share amounts)       Years ended December 31,   Net earnings $ 10,460  $ 8,458  $ 5,034 Less: earnings available to participating securities   Net earnings available to common shareholders $ 10,453  $ 8,452  $ 5,031 Basic      Basic weighted average shares outstanding 579.9  603.2  636.5 Less: participating securities 0.7  0.7  1.0 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 579.2  602.5  635.5 Diluted      Basic weighted average shares outstanding 579.9  603.2  636.5 Dilutive potential common shares (1) 6.3  7.5  7.3 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 586.2  610.7  643.8 Less: participating securities 0.7  0.7  1.0 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 585.5  610.0  642.8 Net earnings per share:      Basic $ 18.05  $ 14.03  $ 7.92 Diluted 17.85  13.85  7.83 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Diluted earnings per share includes any dilutive impact of stock options, restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and performance awards. ##TABLE_END The following table includes the number of shares that may be dilutive potential common shares in the future.

The TCJA revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the rate from 35 % to 21 % effective January 1, 2018, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. The TCJA also enacted provisions which effectively apply a lower U.S. tax rate to intangible income derived from serving non-U.S. markets. In 2018, we recorded a $ 549 tax benefit related to foreign derived intangible income. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  In the third quarter of 2018, we recorded a tax benefit of $ 412 related to the settlement of the 2013-2014 ##TABLE_END federal tax audit. In the third quarter of 2016, a tax benefit of $ 177 was recorded related to the settlement of the 2011-2012 federal tax audit. ##TABLE_START (3)  In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments of $ 181 , $ 207 and $ 105 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  In accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), in the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional tax benefits of $ 1,430 related to the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate and a provisional tax expense of $ 159 related to tax on non-U.S. activities resulting from the TCJA. During the fourth quarter of 2018 and in accordance with SAB 118, the Company completed its accounting for the provisional amounts recognized at December 31, 2017 and recorded an incremental benefit related to refinements to these provisional amounts which was not significant. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded incremental tax benefits of $ 440 related to the application of a 2012 Federal Court of Claims decision which held that the tax basis in certain assets could be increased (tax basis adjustment). ##TABLE_END Significant components of our deferred tax (liabilities)/assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Inventory and long-term contract methods of income recognition ( 5,422 )  ( 6,459 ) Pension benefits 3,344  3,565 Fixed assets, intangibles and goodwill (net of valuation allowance of $16 and $16) ( 1,616 )  ( 1,253 ) Retiree health care benefits 1,124  1,304 Other employee benefits  Accrued expenses and reserves  Customer and commercial financing ( 309 )  ( 369 ) Net operating loss, credit and capital loss carryovers (net of valuation allowance of $77 and $53) (1)  Other ( 115 )  ( 135 ) Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets (2) ($ 1,452 )  ($ 1,867 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Of the deferred tax asset for net operating loss and credit carryovers, $ 244 expires on or before December 31, 2037 and $ 14 may be carried over indefinitely. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  Included in the net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are deferred tax assets in the amounts of $ 4,275 and $ 4,636 related to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. ##TABLE_END Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Deferred tax assets $ 8,835  $ 8,399 Deferred tax liabilities ( 10,194 )  ( 10,197 ) Valuation allowance ( 93 )  ( 69 ) Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets ($ 1,452 )  ($ 1,867 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company has made an accounting policy election to treat Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) as a current year tax expense in the period in which it is incurred. Therefore, we have not provided any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. The TCJA one-time repatriation tax and GILTI liabilities effectively taxed the undistributed earnings previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We have not provided for foreign withholding tax on the undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. If such earnings were to be distributed, any foreign withholding tax would not be significant. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position were not significant. The amounts of interest included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 . A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: ##TABLE_START    Unrecognized tax benefits  January 1 $ 1,736  $ 1,557  $ 1,617 Gross increases  tax positions in prior periods   Gross decreases  tax positions in prior periods ( 410 )  ( 44 )  ( 348 ) Gross increases  current-period tax positions 1,208   Settlements ( 206 )   ( 73 ) Statute Lapse ( 3 )   Unrecognized tax benefits  December 31 $ 2,412  $ 1,736  $ 1,557 ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31 , 2018, 2017 and 2016 , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $ 2,412 , $ 1,736 and $ 1,557 , respectively, of which $ 1,405 , $ 1,568 and $ 1,402 would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. As of December 31, 2018 , these amounts are primarily associated with uncertainties in the TCJA and the amount of research tax credits claimed. Also included in these amounts are accruals for domestic state tax issues such as the allocation of income among various state tax jurisdictions and the amount of state tax credits claimed. Federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2015. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is expected to begin the 2015-2017 federal tax audit in the first quarter of 2019. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2001-2017 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months unrecognized tax benefits related to state matters under audit may decrease by up to $ 460 based on current estimates. Note 7  Accounts Receivable, net Accounts receivable at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Commercial customer contracts $ 2,059  $ 1,560 U.S. government contracts (1) 1,877  1,396 Less valuation allowance ( 57 )  ( 62 ) Total $ 3,879  $ 2,894 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Includes foreign military sales through the U.S. government ##TABLE_END Accounts receivable expected to be collected after one year are not material. Note 8  Inventories Inventories at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Long-term contracts in progress $ 2,129  $ 1,854 Commercial aircraft programs 52,753  52,861 Commercial spare parts, used aircraft, general stock materials and other 7,685  6,673 Total $ 62,567 $ 61,388 ##TABLE_ENDLong-Term Contracts in Progress Long-term contracts in progress includes Delta launch program inventory that is being sold at cost to United Launch Alliance ( ULA ) under an inventory supply agreement that terminates on March 31, 2021. The inventory balance was $227 and $284 at December 31, 2018 and 2017 . See indemnifications to ULA in Note 15 . Included in inventories are capitalized precontract costs of $ 644 at December 31, 2018 primarily related to the KC-46A Tanker and $ 933 at December 31, 2017 primarily related to KC-46A Tanker, C-17 and F/A-18. See Note 14 . Commercial Aircraft Programs At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 787 program: $ 27,852 and $ 30,695 of work in process (including deferred production costs of $ 22,967 and $ 25,358 ), $ 2,453 and $ 3,189 of supplier advances, and $ 2,638 and $ 3,173 of unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs. At December 31, 2018 , $ 17,320 of 787 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and $ 8,285 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , commercial aircraft programs inventory included $ 116 and $ 151 of unamortized tooling costs related to the 747 program. At December 31, 2018 , $ 111 of 747 unamortized tooling costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders or commitments. The program accounting quantity includes one already completed aircraft which is being remarketed. Commercial aircraft programs inventory included amounts credited in cash or other consideration (early issue sales consideration) to airline customers totaling $ 2,844 and $ 2,976 at December 31, 2018 and 2017 . Note 9  Contracts with Customers Unbilled receivables increased from $ 8,194 at December 31, 2017 to $ 10,025 at December 31, 2018 , primarily driven by revenue recognized at BDS, BGS and BCA in excess of billings. Advances and progress billings increased from $ 48,042 at December 31, 2017 to $ 50,676 at December 31, 2018 , primarily driven by advances on orders received in excess of revenue recognized at BCA . Revenues recognized for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 from amounts recorded as Advances and progress billings at the beginning of each year were $ 24,737 and $ 22,796 . The following table summarizes our contract assets under long-term contracts that were unbillable or related to outstanding claims as of December 31: ##TABLE_START  Unbilled  Claims     Current $ 7,178  $ 5,149  $ 1  $ 4 Expected to be collected after one year 2,847  3,045   Total $ 10,025  $ 8,194  $ 3  $ 59 ##TABLE_ENDUnbilled receivables related to commercial customers expected to be collected after one year were $ 150 and $ 172 at December 31 , 2018 and 2017 . Unbilled receivables related to claims are items that we believe are earned, but are subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate realization. Note 10  Customer Financing Customer financing primarily relates to our BCC segment. Prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform with the current year presentation as a result of the adoption of Topic 606. Customer financing consisted of the following at December 31: ##TABLE_START   Financing receivables:    Investment in sales-type/finance leases $ 1,125  $ 1,364 Notes  1,022 Total financing receivables 1,855  2,386 Operating lease equipment, at cost, less accumulated depreciation of $203 and $305  Operating lease incentive   Gross customer financing 2,887  3,077 Less allowance for losses on receivables ( 9 )  ( 12 ) Total $ 2,878  $ 3,065 ##TABLE_ENDThe components of investment in sales-type/finance leases at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Minimum lease payments receivable $ 908  $ 1,159 Estimated residual value of leased assets  Unearned income ( 208 )  ( 290 ) Total $ 1,125  $ 1,364 ##TABLE_ENDOperating lease equipment primarily includes large commercial jet aircraft. Financing receivable balances evaluated for impairment at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Individually evaluated for impairment $ 409  $ 422 Collectively evaluated for impairment 1,446  1,964 Total financing receivables $ 1,855  $ 2,386 ##TABLE_ENDWe determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , we individually evaluated for impairment customer financing receivables of $ 409 and $ 422 , of which $ 398 and $ 411 were determined to be impaired. We recorded no allowance for losses on these impaired receivables as the collateral values exceeded the carrying values of the receivables. Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Income is recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer . The average recorded investment in impaired financing receivables for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $ 403 , and the related interest income was insignificant. The change in the allowance for losses on financing receivables for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 , consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START    Beginning balance - January 1 ($ 12 )  ($ 10 )  ($ 16 ) Customer financing valuation benefit/(cost)  ( 2 )  Ending balance - December 31 ($ 9 )  ($ 12 )  ($ 10 ) Collectively evaluated for impairment ($ 9 )  ($ 12 )  ($ 10 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customer financing receivables are customer credit ratings, default rates and collateral values. We assign internal credit ratings for all customers and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers. Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies. Our financing receivable balances at December 31 by internal credit rating category are shown below: ##TABLE_START Rating categories  BBB $ 883  $ 1,170 BB  B  CCC  Total carrying value of financing receivables $ 1,855  $ 2,386 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2018 , our allowance related to receivables with ratings of B, BB and BBB. We applied default rates that averaged 22.8 % , 6.5 % and 0.7 % , respectively, to the exposure associated with those receivables. Customer Financing Exposure Customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance and overall market conditions and may be subject to reduced valuation with market decline. Declines in collateral values could result in asset impairments, reduced finance lease income, and an increase in the allowance for losses. Our customer financing collateral is concentrated in 747-8 and out-of-production aircraft. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have experienced greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft. The majority of customer financing carrying values are concentrated in the following aircraft models at December 31: ##TABLE_START   717 Aircraft ($204 and $269 accounted for as operating leases) $ 918  $ 1,081 747-8 Aircraft ($132 and $138 accounted for as operating leases)  737 Aircraft ($263 and $127 Accounted for as operating leases)  MD-80 Aircraft (Accounted for as sales-type finance leases)  757 Aircraft ($24 and $27 accounted for as operating leases)  747-400 Aircraft ($45 and $88 Accounted for as operating leases)  777 Aircraft ($60 and $0 accounted for as operating leases)  767 Aircraft ($0 and $25 accounted for as operating leases)  ##TABLE_ENDCharges related to customer financing asset impairment for the years ended December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Boeing Capital $ 1  $ 13  $ 45 Other Boeing   Total $ 39  $ 43  $ 66 ##TABLE_ENDScheduled receipts on customer financing are as follows: ##TABLE_START Year      Beyond 2023 Principal payments on notes receivable $ 658  $ 11  $ 7  $ 37  $ 17  Sales-type/finance lease payments receivable      Operating lease equipment payments receivable      ##TABLE_ENDAs part of selected lease transactions, Boeing may provide incentives to commercial customers. At December 31, 2018 Customer Financing included $ 250 of lease incentives with one customer that is currently experiencing liquidity issues and is seeking additional capital. Should the customer fail to address its liquidity issues the lease incentive asset could become impaired, and we could incur charges of up to $ 250 . Note 11  Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Land $ 546  $ 530 Buildings and land improvements 14,109  14,125 Machinery and equipment 15,221  14,577 Construction in progress 1,337  1,081 Gross property, plant and equipment 31,213  30,313 Less accumulated depreciation ( 18,568 )  ( 17,641 ) Total $ 12,645  $ 12,672 ##TABLE_ENDDepreciation expense was $ 1,556 , $ 1,548 and $ 1,418 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Interest capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 totaled $ 81 , $ 110 and $ 170 , respectively. Rental expense for leased properties was $ 307 , $ 283 and $ 287 , for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. At December 31, 2018 , minimum rental payments under capital leases aggregated $ 164 . Minimum rental payments under operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more aggregated $ 1,838 , net of sublease payments of $ 12 at December 31, 2018 . Payments due under operating and capital leases net of sublease amounts and non-cancellable future rentals during the next five years are as follows: ##TABLE_START      Minimum operating lease payments, net of sublease amounts $ 272  $ 232  $ 194  $ 165  $ 126 Minimum capital lease payments     ##TABLE_ENDAccounts payable related to purchases of property, plant and equipment were $ 338 and $ 196 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 . Note 12  Investments Our investments, which are recorded in Short-term and other investments or Investments, consisted of the following at December 31: ##TABLE_START   Equity method investments (1) $ 1,048  $ 1,214 Time deposits  Available for sale debt instruments  Equity and other investments  Restricted cash  cash equivalents (2)  Total $ 2,014  $ 2,439 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Dividends received were $ 325 and $ 247 during 2018 and 2017 .

The net amounts owed to Boeing by each of the partners are as follows: S.P. Koroley Rocket and Space Corporation Energia of Russia (RSC Energia)  $ 111 , PO Yuzhnoye Mashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukraine  $ 89 and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine  $ 44 . In 2013, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launch partners. In 2016, the United States District Court for the Central District of California issued a judgment in favor of Boeing. Later that year, we reached an agreement which we believe will enable us to recover the outstanding receivable balance from RSC Energia over the next several years. We continue to pursue collection efforts against the former Ukrainian partners in connection with the court judgment. We continue to believe the partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and remedies. In the event we are unable to secure reimbursement from RSC Energia and the Ukrainian Sea Launch partners, we could incur additional charges. Spirit AeroSystems At December 31, 2017 , Other assets included $ 137 of receivables related to indemnifications from Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. (Spirit) for costs incurred related to pension and retiree medical obligations of former Boeing employees who were subsequently employed by Spirit. On July 12, 2018, the Delaware Supreme Court denied Boeings claim for indemnification. As a result, in the second quarter we wrote off the receivables attributable to the Spirit indemnifications. Note 14  Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Accrued compensation and employee benefit costs $ 6,841  $ 6,659 Environmental  Product warranties 1,127  1,211 Forward loss recognition 1,488  Dividends payable 1,160  1,005 Income Taxes Payable  Other 3,152  2,668 Total $ 14,808  $ 13,069 ##TABLE_ENDEnvironmental The following table summarizes environmental remediation activity during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 . ##TABLE_START   Beginning balance  January 1 $ 524  $ 562 Reductions for payments made ( 37 )  ( 45 ) Changes in estimates  Ending balance  December 31 $ 555  $ 524 ##TABLE_ENDThe liabilities recorded represent our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred to remediate sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios that includes the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. There are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by $ 796 and $ 868 . Product Warranties The following table summarizes product warranty activity recorded during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 . ##TABLE_START   Beginning balance  January 1 $ 1,211  $ 1,414 Additions for current year deliveries  Reductions for payments made ( 193 )  ( 241 ) Changes in estimates ( 123 )  ( 236 ) Ending balance  December 31 $ 1,127  $ 1,211 ##TABLE_ENDCommercial Aircraft Commitments In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and airline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer. Trade-in commitment agreements at December 31, 2018 have expiration dates from 2019 through 2026 . At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , total contractual trade-in commitments were $ 1,519 and $ 1,462 . As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , we estimated that it was probable we would be obligated to perform on certain of these commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling $ 522 and $ 155 and the fair value of the related trade-in aircraft was $ 485 and $ 155 . Financing Commitments Financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, and refinancing of delivered aircraft, totaled $ 19,462 and $ 10,221 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 . The estimated earliest potential funding dates for these commitments as of December 31, 2018 are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Total $ 2,331 3,432 2,784 1,787 3,402 Thereafter 5,726  $ 19,462 ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2018 , $18,785 of these financing commitments related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. We have concluded that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralization and interest rates, under which funding would be provided. Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $ 3,761 and $ 3,708 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 . Company Owned Life Insurance McDonnell Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life insurance policies with a cash surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the cash surrender value was $ 466 and $ 489 and the total loans were $ 447 and $ 470 . As we have the right to offset the loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 . United States Government Defense Environment Overview The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, passed in February 2018, raised the 2011 Budget Control Act spending caps for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 (FY18 and FY19). The consolidated spending bills signed into law in September 2018 provide defense funding for FY19, in compliance with the revised caps. These bills also provide FY19 appropriations for most of the federal government. Full year funding for the departments and agencies not covered by enacted FY19 appropriations, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), remains uncertain. The unfunded departments and agencies affected by the partial government shutdown (December 22, 2018 through January 25, 2019) are now covered by a Continuing Resolution that extends funding at FY18 levels through February 15, 2019. Congress and the President must agree to FY19 appropriations or an additional Continuing Resolution to fund affected departments and agencies beyond the February 15 deadline in order to prevent a second partial government shutdown. The impact of a partial government shutdown to the Companys operations would increase as the shutdown continues. There continues to be uncertainty with respect to future program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, including NASA. The 2011 Budget Control Act continues to mandate limits on U.S. government discretionary spending for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (FY20 and FY21). The lower budget caps will take effect again in FY20 and FY21 unless Congress acts to raise the spending caps or to repeal or suspend the law. As a result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work. BDS fixed-price contracts with significant development work include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, T-X Trainer, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25 Stingray, and commercial and military satellites. The operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost and revenue estimates could result in lower margins or material charges for reach-forward losses. For example, we have recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker in 2018 as well as in prior years, and we continue to have risk for further losses if we experience further production, technical or quality issues, and delays in flight testing, certification and/or delivery. In addition, in 2018, in connection with winning the T-X Trainer and MQ-25 Stingray competitions, we recorded a loss of $ 400 associated with options for 346 T-X Trainer aircraft and a loss of $ 291 related to the MQ-25 Stingray Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract. Moreover, our fixed-price development programs remain subject to additional reach-forward losses if we experience further technical or quality issues, schedule delays, or increased costs. KC-46A Tanker In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. This EMD contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $ 4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. In 2016, the USAF authorized two LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at $ 2.8 billion and in 2017, the USAF authorized an additional LRIP lot for 15 aircraft valued at $ 2.1 billion . On September 10, 2018, the USAF authorized an additional LRIP lot for 18 aircraft valued at $ 2.9 billion . In January 2019, we delivered the first KC-46A Tanker to the USAF . At December 31, 2018 , we had approximately $ 370 of capitalized precontract costs and $ 550 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers. Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts Our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve for amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide refunds to the U.S. government. Note 15  Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees. The following table provides quantitative data regarding our third party guarantees. The maximum potential payments represent a worst-case scenario, and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset our payments under guarantees. The carrying amount of liabilities represents the amount included in Accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_START  Maximum Potential Payments  Estimated Proceeds from Collateral/ Recourse  Carrying Amount of Liabilities December 31, 2017  2017  2017 Contingent repurchase commitments $ 1,685 $ 1,605  $ 1,685 $ 1,605  $ 9 Indemnifications to ULA:         Contributed Delta program launch inventory 72       Contract pricing      Other Delta contracts 191     Credit guarantees 109  55  16 ##TABLE_ENDContingent Repurchase Commitments The repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase commitments is generally lower than the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date. Indemnifications to ULA In 2006, we agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of $ 1,360 of Boeing Delta launch program inventory included in contributed assets plus $ 1,860 of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021 . See Note 8 . ULA has yet to consume $ 52 of contributed inventory. We also agreed to indemnify ULA for up to $ 261 in the event ULA was unable to obtain sufficient additional contract pricing from the USAF for certain satellite missions. In the fourth quarter of 2018, ULA and the USAF entered into a settlement agreement which resulted in the USAF making a payment of $ 240 to ULA. Potential payments for Other Delta contracts include $ 85 related to deferred support costs and $ 91 related to deferred production costs. In June 2011, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) notified ULA that it had determined that $ 271 of deferred support costs are not recoverable under government contracts. In December 2011, the DCMA notified ULA of the potential non-recoverability of an additional $ 114 of deferred production costs. ULA and Boeing believe that all costs are recoverable and in November 2011, ULA filed a certified claim with the USAF for collection of deferred support and production costs. The USAF issued a final decision denying ULAs certified claim in May 2012. In 2012, Boeing and ULA, through its subsidiary United Launch Services, filed a suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking recovery of the deferred support and production costs from the U.S. government, which subsequently asserted a counterclaim for credits that it alleges were offset by deferred support cost invoices. We believe that the U.S. governments counterclaim is without merit. The discovery phase of the litigation completed in 2017. Boeing filed a motion on November 17, 2017, asking the court to award full recovery without a trial. The court denied Boeings motion on August 29, 2018. The court has entered the parties proposed pre-trial schedule providing for a final pre-trial conference on or before October 17, 2019. If, contrary to our belief, it is determined that some or all of the deferred support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record pre-tax losses and make indemnification payments to ULA for up to $ 317 of the costs questioned by the DCMA. Other Indemnifications In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and our BCA facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 14 . Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees where we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that the original lessee or debtor does not make payments or perform certain specified services. Generally, these guarantees have been extended on behalf of guaranteed parties with less than investment-grade credit and are collateralized by certain assets. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire through 2036 . Industrial Revenue Bonds Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by St. Louis County were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property at our St. Louis site. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a twelve-year property tax abatement and sales tax exemption from St. Louis County. We record these properties on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. We have also purchased the IRBs and therefore are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the properties purchased with the IRB proceeds. The liabilities and IRB assets are equal and are reported net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the assets and liabilities associated with the IRBs were $ 271 and $ 166 . Note 16  Debt On February 23, 2018 , we issued $ 1,400 of fixed rate senior notes consisting of $ 350 due March 1, 2023 that bear an annual interest rate of 2.8 % , $ 350 due March 1, 2028 that bear an annual interest rate of 3.25 % , $ 350 due March 1, 2038 that bear an annual interest rate of 3.55 % , and $ 350 due March 1, 2048 that bear an annual interest rate of 3.625 % . The notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds of the issuance totaled $ 1,338 , after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. On October 31, 2018 , we issued $ 700 of fixed rate senior notes consisting of $ 350 due November 1, 2028 that bear an annual interest rate of 3.45 % , and $ 350 due November 1, 2048 that bear an annual interest rate of 3.85 % . The notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds of the issuance totaled $ 663 , after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. Interest incurred, including amounts capitalized, was $ 624 , $ 541 and $ 535 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Interest expense recorded by BCC is reflected as Boeing Capital interest expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Total Company interest payments were $ 616 , $ 527 and $ 523 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. We have $ 5,120 currently available under credit line agreements, of which $ 2,610 is a 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in October, 2019 and $ 2,510 expires in October, 2023 . The 364-day credit facility has a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration date. We continue to be in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt or credit facility agreements. Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Unsecured debt securities $ 1,151  $ 599 Non-recourse debt and notes  Capital lease obligations  Commercial paper 1,895  Other notes  Total $ 3,190  $ 1,335 ##TABLE_ENDDebt at December 31 consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   Unsecured debt securities    0.95% - 4.88% due through 2048 $ 7,538  6,127 5.80% - 6.88% due through 2043 2,388  2,386 7.25% - 8.75% due through 2043 1,638  1,637 Commercial paper 1,895      Non-recourse debt and notes    6.98% - 7.38% notes due through 2021  Capital lease obligations due through 2034  Other notes  Total debt $ 13,847  $ 11,117 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2018 and 2017 , commercial paper borrowings totaling $ 1,895 and $ 600 , with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.5 % and 1.4 % , were supported by unused commitments under the revolving credit agreement.

Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional union employees transitioned to company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019. We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans participants, and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for future benefit payments. We also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for approximately half those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered by most United Auto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage. The funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). We have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Other assets, and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in Accrued liabilities. The components of net periodic benefit cost were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension  Other Postretirement Benefits Years ended December 31,      Service cost $ 430  $ 402  $ 604  $ 94  $ 106  $ 128 Interest cost 2,781  2,991  3,050    Expected return on plan assets ( 4,009 )  ( 3,847 )  ( 3,999 )  ( 8 )  ( 7 )  ( 8 ) Amortization of prior service (credits)/costs ( 56 )  ( 39 )   ( 126 )  ( 137 )  ( 126 ) Recognized net actuarial loss 1,130    ( 10 )   Settlement/curtailment/other losses      Net periodic benefit cost $ 320  $ 312  $ 523  $ 144  $ 201  $ 278             Net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations $ 313  $ 510  $ 1,257  $ 84  $ 107  $ 144 Net periodic benefit cost included in Other income/(loss), net ( 143 )  ( 117 )     Net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings before income taxes $ 170  $ 393  $ 1,584  $ 185  $ 230  $ 295 ##TABLE_ENDThe following tables show changes in the benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status of both pensions and OPB for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 .

Key information for our plans with ABO and PBO in excess of plan assets as of December 31 was as follows: ##TABLE_START  Accumulated benefit obligation $ 66,306  $ 71,975 Fair value of plan assets 52,894  58,353 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Projected benefit obligation $ 68,354  $ 74,953 Fair value of plan assets 52,894  58,353 ##TABLE_ENDAssumptions The following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31 of each year and the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year. ##TABLE_START December 31,   Discount rate:      Pension 4.20 %  3.60 %  4.00 % Other postretirement benefits 4.00 %  3.30 %  3.70 % Expected return on plan assets 6.80 %  6.80 %  6.80 % Rate of compensation increase 5.30 %  5.30 %  4.40 % Interest crediting rates for cash balance plans 5.15 %  5.15 %  5.15 % ##TABLE_ENDThe discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high quality bonds that are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yields developed from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. The present value of each plans benefits is calculated by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows. The pension funds expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the upcoming plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five -year moving average of plan assets. As of December 31, 2018 , the MRVA was approximately $ 3,435 more than the fair market value of assets. Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows: ##TABLE_START December 31,   Health care cost trend rate assumed next year 5.50 %  6.00 %  6.50 % Ultimate trend rate 4.50 %  4.50 %  5.00 % Year that trend reached ultimate rate   ##TABLE_ENDPlan Assets Investment Strategy The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified. We periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investment benchmarks to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced periodically. The actual and target allocations by asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Actual Allocations  Target Allocations Asset Class    Fixed income %  %  %  % Global equity    Private equity    Real estate and real assets    Hedge funds    Total %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDFixed income securities are invested primarily in a diversified portfolio of long duration instruments. Global equity securities are invested in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various industries and market capitalizations. Real estate and real assets include global private investments that may be held through an investment in a limited partnership (LP) or other fund structures and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the case of real estate). Real estate includes, but is not limited to, investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include, but are not limited to, investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber), commodities and infrastructure. Private equity investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies. Hedge fund investments seek to capitalize on inefficiencies identified across and within different asset classes or markets. Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to directional, event driven, relative value, long-short and multi-strategy. Investment managers are retained for explicit investment roles specified by contractual investment guidelines. Certain investment managers are authorized to use derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve the desired market exposure of a security or an index, transfer value-added performance between asset classes, achieve the desired currency exposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation. As a percentage of total pension plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were 4.4 % and 5.0 % for fixed income, including to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and 5.5 % and 6.9 % for global equity and commodities at December 31, 2018 and 2017 . In 2017, the Company contributed $ 3,500 of our common stock to the pension fund. An independent fiduciary was retained to manage and liquidate the stock over time at its discretion. The liquidation of the common stock holdings was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. Risk Management In managing the plan assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach and are integral to the overall investment strategy. Further, asset classes are constructed to achieve diversification by investment strategy, by investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored regularly through the custodian. Credit parameters for counterparties have been established for managers permitted to trade over-the-counter derivatives. Valuation is governed through several types of procedures, including reviews of manager valuation policies, custodian valuation processes, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconciliation, and periodic, security-specific valuation testing . Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 . The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017  Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fixed income securities:         Corporate $ 17,481 $ 17,479 $ 2 $ 19,603 $ 19,591 $ 12 U.S. government and agencies 5,589 5,589 5,430 5,430 Mortgage backed and asset backed 410 760 300 Municipal 1,255 1,255 1,355  1,355 Sovereign 967 1,237  1,237  Other $ 53 118 $ 59 Derivatives:       Assets 49 Liabilities ( 51 ) ( 51 ) ( 25 ) ( 25 ) Cash equivalents and other short-term investments 1,068 1,068 1,778 1,778 Equity securities:       U.S. common and preferred stock 3,744 3,744 4,615 4,615 Non-U.S. common and preferred stock 4,850 4,846 6,204 6,204 Derivatives:       Assets 3 1 Liabilities ( 9 ) ( 9 ) ( 4 ) ( 4 ) Private equity  Real estate and real assets:       Real estate 422 462 Real assets 311 4 449 3 Derivatives:       Assets 4 17 Liabilities ( 17 ) ( 1 ) ( 16 ) ( 3 ) ( 3 ) Total $ 36,793 $ 9,375 $ 27,100 $ 318 $ 42,305 $ 11,790 $ 30,200 $ 315          Fixed income common/collective/pooled funds $ 938    $ 1,257    Fixed income other       Equity common/collective pooled funds 5,264    6,786    Private equity 2,934    2,767    Real estate and real assets 3,792    3,744    Hedge funds 5,484    6,440    Total investments measured at NAV as a practical expedient $ 18,854    $ 21,297             Cash $ 205    $ 170    Receivables       Payables ( 154 )    ( 197 )    Total $ 56,102    $ 64,011    ##TABLE_ENDFixed income securities are primarily valued upon a market approach, using matrix pricing and considering a securitys relationship to other securities for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or an income approach, converting future cash flows to a single present value amount. Inputs used in developing fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads. Common/collective/pooled funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their NAVs that are calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives included in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued using an income approach with inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates. Exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Cash equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingled fund (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued daily using a market approach with inputs that include quoted market prices for similar instruments. In the event a market price is not available for instruments with an original maturity of one year or less, amortized cost is used as a proxy for fair value. Common and preferred stock equity securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. Private equity and private debt NAV valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) we use NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Real estate and real asset NAV valuations are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) NAVs are adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Publicly traded REITs and infrastructure stocks are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. Hedge fund NAVs are generally based on the valuation of the underlying investments. This is primarily done by applying a market or income valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument held. Investments in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the General Partner (GP), fund manager or third party administrator. Additionally, some investments in fixed income and equity are made via commingled vehicles and are valued in a similar fashion. Pension assets invested in commingled and limited partnership structures rely on the NAV of these investments as the practical expedient for the valuations. The following tables present a reconciliation of Level 3 assets (excluding investments which are valued using NAVs as a practical expedient) held during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 . Transfers into and out of Level 3 are reported at the beginning-of-year values. ##TABLE_START  January 1 2018 Balance  Net Realized and Unrealized Gains/(Losses)  Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements  Net Transfers Into/(Out of) Level 3  December 31 2018 Balance Fixed income securities:          Corporate (1) $ 2      $ 2 Mortgage backed and asset backed (1)  ($ 3 )  $ 3  $ 2  Real assets     Total $ 315  ($ 3 )  $ 3  $ 3  $ 318 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  January 1 2017 Balance  Net Realized and Unrealized Gains/(Losses)  Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements  Net Transfers Into/(Out of) Level 3  December 31 2017 Balance Fixed income securities:          Corporate (1) $ 12   $ 1  ($ 1 )  $ 12 U.S. government and agencies      ( 1 )  Mortgage backed and asset backed (1)  $ 10  ( 39 )  ( 2 )  Equity securities:         U.S. common and preferred stock  (1 )     Real assets   ( 2 )    Total $ 350  $ 9  ($ 40 )  ($ 4 )  $ 315 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Certain fixed income securities were reclassified between mortgage backed and asset backed and corporate on January 1, 2018 and 2017. ##TABLE_END The changes in unrealized (losses)/gains for Level 3 mortgage backed and asset backed fixed income securities still held at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were a loss of $ 4 and a gain of $ 6 . OPB Plan Assets The majority of OPB plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised of approximately 60 % equities and 40 % debt securities. The index fund is valued using a market approach based on the quoted market price of an identical instrument (Level 1). The expected rate of return on these assets does not have a material effect on the net periodic benefit cost. Cash Flows Contributions Required pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ), as well as rules governing funding of our non-US pension plans, are not expected to be significant in 2019 . We do not expect to make contributions to our pension plans in 2019 . Estimated Future Benefit Payments The table below reflects the total pension benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants share of the cost, which is funded by participant contributions. OPB payments reflect our portion only. ##TABLE_START Year(s)      2024-2028 Pensions $ 4,711  $ 4,706  $ 4,684  $ 4,630  $ 4,575  $ 22,171 Other postretirement benefits:            Gross benefits paid      2,066 Subsidies ( 17 )  ( 17 )  ( 17 )  ( 18 )  ( 18 )  ( 90 ) Net other postretirement benefits $ 469  $ 469  $ 460  $ 458  $ 447  $ 1,976 ##TABLE_ENDTermination Provisions Certain of the pension plans provide that, in the event there is a change in control of the Company which is not approved by the Board of Directors and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required by ERISA , and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits in our group insurance benefit programs. Should we terminate certain pension plans under conditions in which the plans assets exceed that plans obligations, the U.S. government will be entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plans assets based on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts. Defined Contribution Plans We provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expense for these defined contribution plans was $ 1,480 , $ 1,522 and $ 1,413 in 2018, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Note 18  Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements Share-Based Compensation Our 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated, permits awards of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or units, performance shares, performance restricted stock or units, performance units and other stock and cash-based awards to our employees, officers, directors, consultants, and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock authorized for issuance under the plan is 87,000,000 . Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfy these issuances during 2019 . Share-based plans expense is primarily included in General and administrative expense since it is incentive compensation issued primarily to our executives. The share-based plans expense and related income tax benefit were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Stock options   $ 4 Restricted stock units and other awards $ 213  $ 212  Share-based plans expense $ 213  $ 212  $ 193 Income tax benefit $ 46  $ 46  $ 69 ##TABLE_ENDStock Options We discontinued granting options in 2014, replacing them with performance-based restricted stock units. Options granted through January 2014 had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. The stock options vested over a period of three years and were fully vested at December 31, 2018 . Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2018 is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Shares  Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share  Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years)  Aggregate Intrinsic Value Number of shares under option:        Outstanding at beginning of year 4,417,218  $ 71.69     Exercised ( 1,165,135 )  69.53     Outstanding at end of year 3,252,083  $ 72.47  3.20  $ 813 Exercisable at end of year 3,252,083  $ 72.47  3.20  $ 813 ##TABLE_ENDThe total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $ 320 , $ 491 and $ 265 , with a related tax benefit of $ 70 , $ 175 and $ 94 , respectively. No options vested during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The grant date fair value of stock options vested during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $ 27 . Restricted Stock Units In February 2018, 2017 and 2016 , we granted to our executives 260,730 , 523,835 and 777,837 restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of $ 361.13 , $ 178.72 and $ 117.50 per unit, respectively. The RSUs granted under this program will vest and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. In addition to RSUs awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant RSUs to certain executives and employees to encourage retention or to reward various achievements. These RSUs are labeled other RSUs in the table below. The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average of the high and low stock prices on the date of grant. RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2018 was as follows: ##TABLE_START  Long-Term Incentive Program  Other Number of units:    Outstanding at beginning of year 1,627,102  1,156,462 Granted 287,729  216,949 Dividends 28,249  20,759 Forfeited ( 80,426 )  ( 30,745 ) Distributed ( 540,403 )  ( 379,190 ) Outstanding at end of year 1,322,251  984,235 Unrecognized compensation cost $ 97  $ 108 Weighted average remaining contractual life (years) 1.8  3.1 ##TABLE_ENDThe number of vested but undistributed RSUs at December 31, 2018 was not significant. Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PBRSUs) are stock units that pay out based on the Companys total shareholder return as compared to a group of peer companies over a three-year period. The award payout can range from 0 % to 200 % of the initial PBRSU grant. PBRSUs granted in February 2017 and 2016 will not exceed 400 % of the initial value (excluding dividend equivalent credits). The PBRSUs granted under this program will vest at the payout amount and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) remains eligible under the award and, if the award is earned, will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the PBRSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. In February 2018, 2017 and 2016 , we granted to our executives 241,284 , 492,273 and 721,176 PBRSUs as part of our long-term incentive program. Compensation expense for the award is recognized over the three-year performance period based upon the grant date fair value. The grant date fair values were estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model with the assumptions presented below. The model includes no expected dividend yield as the units earn dividend equivalents. ##TABLE_START Grant Year Grant Date Performance Period Expected Volatility Risk Free Interest Rate Grant Date Fair Value 2/26/2018 3 years 22.11 % 2.36 % 390.27 2/27/2017 3 years 21.37 % 1.46 % 190.17 2/22/2016 3 years 22.44 % 0.92 % 126.74 ##TABLE_ENDPBRSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2018 was as follows: ##TABLE_START   Long-Term Incentive Program Number of units:   Outstanding at beginning of year  1,551,734 Granted  241,284 Performance based adjustment (1)  374,406 Dividends  65,339 Forfeited  ( 70,284 ) Distributed  ( 893,812 ) Outstanding at end of year  1,268,667 Unrecognized compensation cost  $ 86 Weighted average remaining contractual life (years)  1.8 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Represents net incremental number of units issued at vesting based on TSR for units granted in 2015 ##TABLE_END Other Compensation Arrangements Performance Awards Performance Awards are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a three-year period. Each unit has an initial value of $ 100 dollars. The amount payable at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from $ 0 to $ 200 dollars per unit, depending on the Companys performance against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to pay these awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on the estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period. During 2018, 2017 and 2016 , we granted Performance Awards to our executives as part of our long-term incentive program with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals for each three-year period following the grant date. The minimum payout amount is $ 0 and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out for the 2018, 2017 and 2016 Performance Awards is $ 369 , $ 332 and $ 310 , respectively. The 2016 grant is expected to be paid out in cash in March 2019 . Deferred Compensation The Company has deferred compensation plans which permit employees to defer a portion of their salary, bonus, certain other incentive awards, and retirement contributions. Participants can diversify these amounts among 22 investment funds including a Boeing stock unit account. Total expense related to deferred compensation was $ 19 , $ 240 and $ 46 in 2018, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the deferred compensation liability which is being marked to market was $ 1,572 and $ 1,547 . Note 19  Shareholders Equity On December 17, 2018 , the Board approved a new repurchase plan for up to $ 20,000 of common stock, replacing the previously authorized program. The program will expire when we have used all authorized funds or is otherwise terminated. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , there were 1,200,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. No preferred stock has been issued.

These are included in the net periodic pension cost. See Note 17 . ##TABLE_ENDNote 20  Derivative Financial Instruments Cash Flow Hedges Our cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage currency risk associated with certain transactions, specifically forecasted sales and purchases made in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2024 . We use commodity derivatives, such as fixed-price purchase commitments to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. Our commodity contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2021 . Fair Value Hedges Interest rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt. The net change in fair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in Boeing Capital interest expense. Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment We have entered into agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives and non-U.S. business requirements. These agreements are derivative instruments for accounting purposes. The quantities of aluminum in these agreements offset and are priced at prevailing market prices. We also hold certain foreign currency forward contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Notional Amounts and Fair Values The notional amounts and fair values of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Notional amounts (1) Other assets Accrued liabilities   2018  2018  Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:          Foreign exchange contracts $ 3,407  $ 2,930 $ 32  $ 131 ($ 132 )  ($ 63 ) Interest rate contracts      Commodity contracts  9  ( 2 )  ( 6 ) Derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment:          Foreign exchange contracts  11  ( 2 )  ( 5 ) Commodity contracts       Total derivatives $ 4,481  $ 4,080  ( 136 )  ( 74 ) Netting arrangements    ( 24 )  ( 61 )  Net recorded balance    $ 28  $ 93 ($ 112 ) ($ 13 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Notional amounts represent the gross contract/notional amount of the derivatives outstanding. ##TABLE_END Gains/(losses) associated with our cash flow and undesignated hedging transactions and their effect on Other comprehensive income/(loss) and Net earnings were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  Effective portion recognized in Other comprehensive income/(loss), net of taxes:    Foreign exchange contracts ($ 156 )  $ 123 Commodity contracts  ( 4 ) Effective portion reclassified out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings, net of taxes:    Foreign exchange contracts ( 33 )  ( 50 ) Commodity contracts  ( 2 ) Forward points recognized in Other income/(loss), net:    Foreign exchange contracts  Undesignated derivatives recognized in Other income/(loss), net:    Foreign exchange contracts  ##TABLE_ENDBased on our portfolio of cash flow hedges, we expect to reclassify losses of $ 6 (pre-tax) out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings during the next 12 months. Ineffectiveness related to our hedges recognized in Other income/(loss), net was insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 . We have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. For foreign exchange contracts with original maturities of at least five years, our derivative counterparties could require settlement if we default on our five-year credit facility. For certain commodity contracts, our counterparties could require collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and commodity contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at December 31, 2018 was $ 35 . At December 31, 2018 , there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives. Note 21  Fair Value Measurements The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy. ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017  Total Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Assets       Money market funds $ 1,737 $ 1,737  $ 1,582 $ 1,582  Available-for-sale debt investments:       Commercial paper  70  Corporate notes  382  U.S. government agencies   Other equity investments 12  18  Derivatives  93  $ 93 Total assets $ 2,275 $ 1,749 $ 526 $ 2,192 $ 1,600 $ 592        Liabilities       Derivatives ($ 112 )  ($ 112 ) ($ 13 )  ($ 13 ) Total liabilities ($ 112 )  ($ 112 ) ($ 13 )  ($ 13 ) ##TABLE_ENDMoney market funds, available-for-sale debt investments and equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices or broker/dealer quotes of identical or comparable instruments. Derivatives include foreign currency, commodity and interest rate contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve. Certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following table presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended December 31 due to long-lived asset impairment, and the fair value and asset classification of the related assets as of the impairment date: ##TABLE_START    Fair Value  Total Losses  Fair Value  Total Losses Investments  ($ 50 )  $ 1  ($ 44 ) Operating lease equipment $ 101  ( 39 )   ($ 32 ) Other assets and Acquired intangible assets    ( 23 ) Property, plant and equipment  ( 4 )   ( 2 ) Total $ 145  ($ 93 )  $ 113  ($ 101 ) ##TABLE_ENDInvestments, Acquired intangible assets and Property, plant and equipment were primarily valued using an income approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. The fair value of the impaired operating lease equipment is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of third party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades and other market factors. Management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued appropriateness and consistency with market trends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected net sales price for the aircraft. For Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2018 , the following table presents the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques and related unobservable inputs of those assets. ##TABLE_START  Fair Value  Valuation Technique(s)  Unobservable Input  Range Median or Average Operating lease equipment $ 101  Market approach  Aircraft value publications  $103 - $164 (1) Median $123   Aircraft condition adjustments  ($25) - $3 (2) Net ($22) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  The range represents the sum of the highest and lowest values for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, according to the third party aircraft valuation publications that we use in our valuation process. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  The negative amount represents the sum, for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, of all downward adjustments based on consideration of individual aircraft attributes and condition. The positive amount represents the sum of all such upward adjustments. ##TABLE_END Fair Value Disclosures The fair values and related carrying values of financial instruments that are not required to be remeasured at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2018  Carrying Amount  Total Fair Value  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets          Notes receivable, net $ 730  $ 735    $ 735   Liabilities          Debt, excluding capital lease obligations and commercial paper ( 11,796 )  ( 12,746 )    ( 12,682 )  ($ 64 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  December 31, 2017  Carrying Amount  Total Fair Value  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets          Notes receivable, net $ 1,022  $ 1,046    $ 1,046   Liabilities          Debt, excluding capital lease obligations and commercial paper ( 10,380 )  ( 11,923 )    ( 11,823 )  ($ 100 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe fair values of notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on current market yields. For our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowing cost derived from dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. The fair values of our debt classified as Level 3 are based on discounted cash flow models using the implied yield from similar securities. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain. Items not included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, Accounts receivable, Unbilled receivables, Other current assets, Accounts payable and long-term payables. The carrying values of those items, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at December 31, 2018 and 2017 . The fair value of assets and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1). Note 22  Legal Proceedings Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are pending against us. In addition, we are subject to various U.S. government inquiries and investigations from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, or government dispute and investigation will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Note 23  Segment and Revenue Information Our primary profitability measurements to review a segments operating results are Earnings from operations and operating margins. We operate in four reportable segments: BCA , BDS , BGS , and BCC . All other activities fall within Unallocated items, eliminations and other. See page 53 for the Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note. BCA develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide. Revenue on commercial aircraft contracts is recognized at the point in time when an aircraft is completed and accepted by the customer. Revenue on certain military derivative aircraft contracts is recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred. BDS engages in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and related services: manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems, surveillance and engagement, strategic defense and intelligence systems, satellite systems and space exploration. BDS revenue is generally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred. BGS provides parts, maintenance, modifications, logistics support, training, data analytics and information-based services to commercial and government customers worldwide. BGS segment revenue and costs include certain services provided to other segments. Revenue on commercial spare parts contracts is recognized at the point in time when a spare part is delivered to the customer. Revenue on other contracts is generally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers. While our principal operations are in the United States, Canada and Australia, some key suppliers and subcontractors are located in Europe and Japan. Revenues, including foreign military sales, are reported by customer location and consist of the following: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Asia, other than China $ 12,141  $ 9,195  $ 9,892 Europe 12,976  11,240  13,018 China 13,764  11,932  10,289 Middle East 9,745  11,433  12,251 Oceania 2,298  1,931  1,693 Canada 2,583  2,212  2,084 Africa 1,486   1,990 Latin America, Caribbean and other 1,458  1,541  1,972 Total non-U.S. revenues 56,451  50,299  53,189 United States 44,676  43,706  40,307 Total revenues $ 101,127  $ 94,005  $ 93,496 ##TABLE_ENDRevenues from the U.S. government (including foreign military sales through the U.S. government), primarily recorded at BDS and BGS, represented 31 % , 31 % and 30 % of consolidated revenues for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Approximately 4 % of operating assets were located outside the United States as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 . The following tables present BCA, BDS and BGS revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated in a number of ways, such as geographic location, contract type and the method of revenue recognition. We believe these best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

Backlog is converted into revenue in future periods as work is performed, primarily based on the cost incurred or at delivery and acceptance of products, depending on the applicable accounting method. Our backlog at December 31, 2018 was $ 490,481 . We expect approximately 19 % to be converted to revenue through 2019 and approximately 65 % through 2022 , with the remainder thereafter.

Unallocated Items, Eliminations and other Unallocated items, eliminations and other include common internal services that support Boeings global business operations, intercompany guarantees provided to BCC and eliminations of certain sales between segments. Such sales include airplanes accounted for as operating leases and considered transferred to the BCC segment and airplanes transferred to the BDS segment for further modification prior to delivery to the customer.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP Chicago, Illinois February 8, 2019 ", "9A": " Item 9A.
