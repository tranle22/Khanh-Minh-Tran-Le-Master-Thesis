Business McDonalds Corporation, the registrant, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to herein as the Company. a. General development of business During 2009, there have been no material changes to the Companys corporate structure or in its method of conducting business. In 2009, the Company has continued the process it began in 2005 to realign certain subsidiaries to develop a corporate structure within its geographic segments that better reflects the operation of the McDonalds worldwide business. b. Financial information about segments Segment data for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are included in Part II, Item 8, page 44 of this Form 10-K. c. Narrative description of business ##TABLE_START   General ##TABLE_END The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants in the food service industry. These restaurants serve a varied, yet limited, value-priced menu (see Products) in more than 100 countries around the world. All restaurants are operated either by the Company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchise arrangements, and foreign affiliated markets and developmental licensees under license agreements. The Companys operations are designed to assure consistency and high quality at every restaurant. When granting franchises or licenses, the Company is selective and generally is not in the practice of franchising to passive investors. Under the conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and dcor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. A discussion regarding site selection is included in Part I, Item 2, page 6 of this Form 10-K. Conventional franchisees contribute to the Companys revenue stream through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees received upon the opening of a new restaurant or the granting of a new franchise term. The conventional franchise arrangement typically lasts 20 years, and franchising practices are generally consistent throughout the world. Over 70% of franchised restaurants operate under conventional franchise arrangements. The Company has an equity investment in a limited number of foreign affiliated markets, referred to as affiliates. The largest of these affiliates is Japan, where there are 3,714 restaurants. The Company receives a royalty based on a percent of sales in these markets. Under a developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest. While the Company has no capital invested, it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales, as well as initial fees. During 2007, the Company sold its businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and 13 other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, which totaled 1,571 restaurants, to a developmental licensee organization. These markets are referred to as Latam. The Company and its franchisees purchase food, packaging, equipment and other goods from numerous independent suppliers. The Company has established and strictly enforces high quality standards and product specifications. The Company has quality assurance labs around the world to ensure that its high standards are consistently met. The quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews, but also on-site inspections of suppliers facilities. Further, a quality assurance board, composed of the Companys technical, safety and supply chain specialists, provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food quality and safety. In addition, the Company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation, assure best practices and drive continuous improvement. Leveraging scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies, the Company also collaborates with suppliers toward a goal of achieving competitive, predictable food and paper costs over the long term. Independently owned and operated distribution centers, approved by the Company, distribute products and supplies to most McDonalds restaurants. In addition, restaurant personnel are trained in the proper storage, handling and preparation of products and in the delivery of customer service. McDonalds global brand is well known. Marketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed to promote McDonalds brand image and differentiate the Company from competitors. Marketing and promotional efforts focus on value, food taste, menu choice and the customer experience. The Company endeavors to continuously improve its social and environmental performance to achieve long-term sustainability, which benefits McDonalds and the communities it serves. In February 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox Automated Retail, LLC. and in April 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K.-based Pret A Manger. The Company operated Boston Market in the U.S., prior to its sale in August 2007. ##TABLE_START   Products ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu, although there may be geographic variations. In addition, McDonalds tests new products on an ongoing basis. McDonalds menu includes hamburgers and cheeseburgers, Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Filet-O-Fish, several chicken sandwiches, Chicken McNuggets, Chicken Selects, Snack Wraps, french fries, premium salads, shakes, McFlurry desserts, sundaes, soft serve cones, pies, cookies, soft drinks, coffee, McCaf beverages and other beverages. In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of other products during limited-time promotions. McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. and many international markets offer a full or limited breakfast menu. Breakfast offerings may include Egg McMuffin, Sausage McMuffin with Egg, McGriddles, biscuit and bagel sandwiches, hotcakes and muffins.  ##TABLE_START   Intellectual property ##TABLE_END The Company owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information. The Company considers the trademarks McDonalds and The Golden Arches Logo to be of material importance to its business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. Patents, copyrights and licenses are of varying remaining durations. ##TABLE_START   Seasonal operations ##TABLE_END The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree. ##TABLE_START   Working capital practices ##TABLE_END Information about the Companys working capital practices is incorporated herein by reference to Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 in Part II, Item 7, pages 10 through 28, and the Consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 in Part II, Item 8, page 32 of this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START   Customers ##TABLE_END The Companys business is not dependent upon either a single customer or small group of customers. ##TABLE_START   Backlog ##TABLE_END Company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders. ##TABLE_START   Government contracts ##TABLE_END No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government. ##TABLE_START   Competition ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of food products. The Company competes on the basis of price, convenience, service, menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry. In measuring the Companys competitive position, management reviews data compiled by Euromonitor International, a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry. The Companys primary competition, which management refers to as the Informal Eating Out (IEO) segment, includes the following restaurant categories defined by Euromonitor International: quick-service eating establishments, casual dining full-service restaurants, 100% home delivery/takeaway providers, street stalls or kiosks, specialist coffee shops and self-service cafeterias. The IEO segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and full-service restaurants other than casual dining. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the global IEO segment was composed of approximately 5.9 million outlets and generated $875 billion in annual sales in 2008, the most recent year for which data is available. McDonalds global 2008 restaurant business accounted for approximately 0.5% of those outlets and about 8% of the sales. Management also on occasion benchmarks McDonalds against the entire restaurant industry, including the IEO segment defined above and all other full-service restaurants. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 12.6 million outlets and generated about $1.85 trillion in annual sales in 2008. McDonalds global restaurant business accounted for approximately 0.2% of those outlets and about 4% of the sales. ##TABLE_START   Research and development ##TABLE_END The Company operates research and development facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. While research and development activities are important to the Companys business, these expenditures are not material. Independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System). ##TABLE_START   Environmental matters ##TABLE_END Increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives, particularly in the area of climate change. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. Although the impact would likely vary by world region and/or market, we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs, including for the Company, its franchisees and suppliers. Also, there is a possibility that governmental initiatives, or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns or climate, could have a direct impact on the operations of our restaurants or the operations of our suppliers in ways which we cannot predict at this time. The Company continually monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner. At this time, the Company has already undertaken its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment, including the development of means of monitoring and reducing energy use, in many of its markets. ##TABLE_START   Number of employees ##TABLE_END The Companys number of employees worldwide, including Company-operated restaurant employees, was approximately 385,000 as of year-end 2009. d. Financial information about geographic areas Financial information about geographic areas is incorporated herein by reference to Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in Part II, Item 7, pages 10 through 28 and Segment and geographic information in Part II, Item 8, page 44 of this Form 10-K. e.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook for 2010. These statements use such words as may, will, expect, believe and plan. They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements. Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. The most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment. The informal eating out (IEO) segment of the restaurant industry, although largely mature in our major markets, is highly fragmented and competitive. The current economic environment has caused the IEO segment to contract in many markets, including some of our major markets, and this may continue. The current economic environment has increased consumer focus on value, heightening pricing pressures across the industry, which could affect our ability to continue to grow sales despite the strength of our Brand and value proposition. We have the added challenge of the cultural, economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate. Regulatory and similar initiatives around the world have also become more wide-ranging and prescriptive and affect how we operate and our results. In particular, increasing focus on nutritional content and on the production, processing and preparation of food from field to front counter presents challenges for our Brand. The risks we face can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance. Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we execute the Plan to Win, particularly as the global economy emerges from recession. The Plan to Win addresses the key drivers of our business and resultspeople, products, place, price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following: ##TABLE_START   Our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to trends or other factors that affect the IEO segment and our competitive position in the diverse markets we serve, such as spending patterns, demographic changes, trends in food preparation, consumer preferences and publicity about our products, all of which can drive popular perceptions of our business or affect the willingness of other companies to enter into site, supply or other arrangements or alliances with us; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The success of our initiatives to support menu choice, physical activity and nutritional awareness and to address these and other matters of social responsibility in a way that communicates our values effectively and inspires trust and confidence; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our ability to respond effectively to adverse perceptions about the quick-service category of the IEO segment, our products and promotions (including the premiums we offer, such as our Happy Meal toys) or the reliability of our supply chain and the safety of the ingredients we use, and our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonalds of food-borne illnesses or product safety issues; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The success of our plans to improve existing products and to roll out new products and product line extensions, as well as the impact of our competitors actions, including in response to our product improvements and introductions, and our ability to continue robust product development and manage the complexity of our restaurant operations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our ability to achieve an overall product mix that differentiates the McDonalds experience and balances consumer value with margin expansion, particularly in markets where pricing or cost pressures are significant or have been exacerbated by challenging economic conditions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of our pricing, marketing and promotional plans on sales and margins and our ability to adjust our plans to respond quickly to changing economic conditions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of events such as boycotts or protests, labor strikes and supply chain interruptions (including due to lack of supply or price increases) that can adversely affect us directly or adversely affect the vendors, franchisees and others that are also part of the McDonalds System and whose performance has a material impact on our results; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our ability to recruit and retain qualified local personnel to manage our operations and growth in certain developing markets; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START   Our ability to drive restaurant improvements and to motivate our restaurant personnel to achieve sustained high service levels so as to improve consumer perceptions of our ability to meet expectations for quality food served in clean and friendly environments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Whether our restaurant remodeling and rebuilding efforts, which remain a priority notwithstanding the current period of slow economic growth and challenging credit markets, are targeted at the elements of the restaurant experience that will best accomplish our goals to enhance the relevance of our Brand and achieve an efficient allocation of our capital resources; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our ability to maintain alignment with franchisees on operating, promotional and capital-intensive initiatives; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The risks to our Brand if a franchisee defaults in its obligations (particularly requirements to pay royalties, make capital investments and open new restaurants), experiences food safety or other operational problems or projects a brand image inconsistent with our values, all of which are more significant risks if a franchisee controls a large number of restaurants as is the case in Latin America; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our ability to leverage promotional or operating successes in individual markets into other markets in a timely and cost-effective way. ##TABLE_END Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, which can adversely affect our sales, margins and net income. Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions, but also by local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market or daypart (e.g., breakfast). To mitigate the impact of these conditions, we may take promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins, limit our operating flexibility or result in charges, restaurant closings or sales of Company-operated restaurants. Some macroeconomic conditions could have an even more wide-ranging and prolonged impact. The current environment has been characterized by slowing economies, rising unemployment, declining wages, constrained credit and volatile financial markets. These conditions have significantly affected consumer spending and habits. Moreover, the timing and strength of a recovery is uncertain in many of our most important markets, and growth in consumer spending generally lags improvement in the broader economy. The key factors that affect our ability to manage the impact of these conditions are the following: ##TABLE_START   Whether our strategies will permit us to compete effectively and make continued market share gains, while at the same time achieving sales and operating income within our targeted long-term average annual range of growth; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The effectiveness of our supply chain management, including hedging strategies, to preserve and, where possible, expand our margins; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our ability to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates and governmental actions to manage national economic conditions such as credit availability, consumer spending, unemployment levels and inflation rates; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START   The impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor-intensive business model, the long-term trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets and the potential impact of union organizing efforts on day-to-day operations of our restaurants; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Whether we are able to identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants from year to year, and whether new sites are as profitable as expected; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets, such as China, Russia and India, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest, all of which are exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment charges that reduce our earnings. ##TABLE_END Increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following: ##TABLE_START   The cost, compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting regulations we face, especially in the United States where inconsistent standards imposed by local, state and federal authorities can adversely affect popular perceptions of our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings, and the impact of new, potential or changing regulation that affects or restricts elements of our business, particularly those relating to advertising to children, nutritional content and product labeling and safety; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of nutritional, health and other scientific inquiries and conclusions, which constantly evolve and often have contradictory implications, but nonetheless drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation, including taxation, in ways that could be material to our business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The risks and costs of McDonalds nutritional labeling and other disclosure practices, particularly given differences among applicable legal requirements and practices within the restaurant industry with respect to testing and disclosure, ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants, and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information obtained from third party suppliers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters, such as climate change, the ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START   reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption, including as a result of initiatives that effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions, such as the proposed cap and trade legislation pending in the U.S. Congress; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of litigation trends, particularly in our major markets, including class actions, labor and employment claims and landlord/tenant disputes; the relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings; and the cost and other effects of settlements or judgments, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our Brand and products; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our advertising or other communications; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The increasing costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and overseas regulations affecting our workforce and labor practices, including regulations relating to wage and hour practices, immigration, mandatory healthcare benefits and unlawful workplace discrimination; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of the current economic conditions on unemployment levels and consumer confidence and the effect of initiatives to stimulate economic recovery and to further regulate financial markets (including through changes in taxation) on the cost and availability of funding for the Company and its franchisees, inflation and foreign exchange rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Disruptions in our operations or price volatility in a market that can result from governmental actions, such as price or import- export controls, increased tariffs or government-mandated closure of our or our vendors operations, and the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or proceedings, whether or not they have merit; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The risks associated with information security and the use of cashless payments, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with privacy, consumer protection and other laws, the impact on our margins as the use of cashless payments increases, the potential costs associated with alleged security breaches and the loss of consumer confidence that may result; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, related legal or regulatory interpretations or our critical accounting estimates, changes in tax accounting or tax laws (or interpretations thereof), and the impact of settlements of adjustments proposed by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. ##TABLE_END The trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors. Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these, some of which are outside our control, are the following: ##TABLE_START   The current uncertain global economic conditions and market volatility; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   financial markets, particularly in the United States which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can reflect market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete in some cases) or expectations about our business, our creditworthiness or investor confidence generally; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonalds may be included, such as the SP 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of our stock repurchase program, dividend rate or changes in our debt levels on our credit ratings, interest expense, ability to obtain funding on favorable terms or our operating or financial flexibility, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact on our results of other corporate actions, such as those we may take from time to time as part of our continuous review of our corporate structure in light of business, legal and tax considerations. ##TABLE_END Our results and financial condition are affected by our ownership mix. Our refranchising strategy involves a shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing. When we refranchise a restaurant, it reduces consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales shift to franchised sales, where we receive rent and/or royalties. It also reduces Company-operated margin dollars while increasing franchised margin dollars, with the impact on margin percentages varying based on sales and operating costs of the refranchised restaurants. Our refranchising strategy can also expose us to risks, including the following: ##TABLE_START   Whether the franchisees we select will have the experience and financial resources in the relevant markets to be effective operators of McDonalds restaurants; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Potential ongoing payment obligations as a result of our retention of any contingent liabilities in connection with refranchising transactions, such as the indemnification obligations we may incur as a result of the Latam transaction; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The risk that our contractual and other rights and remedies to protect against defaults by our counterparties will be limited by local law, costly to exercise or otherwise subject to limitations or litigation that may impair our ability to prevent or mitigate any adverse impact on our Brand or on the financial performance we expect under our franchising and developmental license agreements. ##TABLE_END  Our results can be adversely affected by disruptions or events, such as the impact of severe weather conditions and natural disasters. Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events can have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels or on other factors that affect our results and prospects, such as commodity costs. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. ", "2": " ITEM 2. Properties The Company owns and leases real estate primarily in connection with its restaurant business. The Company identifies and develops sites that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential to the Company. To assess potential, the Company analyzes traffic and walking patterns, census data and other relevant data. The Companys experience and access to advanced technology aid in evaluating this information. The Company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for restaurant sites, which ensures long-term occupancy rights and helps control related costs. Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to control average development costs through construction and design efficiencies, standardization and by leveraging the Companys global sourcing network. Additional information about the Companys properties is included in Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in Part II, Item 7, pages 10 through 28 and in Financial statements and supplementary data in Part II, Item 8, pages 29 through 47 of this Form 10-K. ", "3": " ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings The Company has pending a number of lawsuits that have been filed from time to time in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover a broad variety of allegations spanning the Companys entire business. The following is a brief description of the more significant of these categories of lawsuits. In addition, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local regulations that impact various aspects of its business, as discussed below. While the Company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, unfavorable rulings could occur. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on net income for the period in which the ruling occurs or for future periods. ##TABLE_START   Obesity ##TABLE_END On or about February 17, 2003, two minors, by their parents and guardians, filed an Amended Complaint against McDonalds Corporation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Case No. 02 Civ. 7821) (Ashley Pelman, a child under the age of 18 years, by her mother and natural guard ian, Roberta Pelman, and Jazlen Bradley, a child under the age of 18 years, by her father and natural guardian, Israel Bradley, v. McDonalds Corporation) seeking class action status on behalf of individuals in New York under the age of 18 (and their parents and/or guardians), who became obese or developed other adverse health conditions allegedly from eating McDonalds products. On September 3, 2003, the Court dismissed all counts of the complaint with prejudice. On January 25, 2005, following an appeal by the plaintiffs, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the District Courts decision to dismiss alleged violations of Section 349 of the New York Consumer Protection Act as set forth in Counts I-III of the amended complaint. On December 12, 2005, the plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint. In this complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that McDonalds Corporation: (1) engaged in a deceptive advertising campaign to be perceived to be less nutritionally detrimental-than-in-fact; (2) failed to disclose adequately its use of certain additives and ingredients; and (3) failed to provide nutritional information about its products. Plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages; an order directing defendants to label their individual products specifying the fat, salt, sugar, cholesterol and dietary content; an order prohibiting marketing to certain individuals; funding of an educational program to inform children and adults of the dangers of eating certain foods sold by defendants; and attorneys fees and costs. The Company believes that it has substantial legal and factual defenses to the plaintiffs claims and intends to defend this lawsuit vigorously. ##TABLE_START   Allergens ##TABLE_END Plaintiffs have filed numerous complaints against the Company (and in some instances our franchisee or a franchisees operating company), alleging that McDonalds misrepresented its french fries and hash browns as free of wheat, gluten and/or milk, when the french fries and hash browns allegedly contain derivatives of wheat, gluten and/or milk. The complaints include claims for violation of state consumer fraud acts, unfair competition or deceptive trade practices acts, strict liability, failure to warn, negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, fraud and fraudulent concealment, negligent misrepresentation and concealment, unjust enrichment, and false advertising. They seek to recover unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, restitution and disgorgement of profits, and attorneys fees. On December 2, 2009, the previously identified case, Debra Moffatt v. McDonalds Corporation (MDL Case No. 06-cv-4467), which was one of several cases pending in the Northern District of Illinois that were combined into one action, was resolved along with the other cases that made up the consolidated action. ##TABLE_START   Franchising ##TABLE_END A substantial number of McDonalds restaurants are franchised to independent entrepreneurs operating under contractual arrangements with the Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company and its franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects including, but not limited to, quality, service and cleanliness issues, contentions regarding grants or terminations of franchises, delinquent payments of rents and fees, and franchisee claims for additional franchises or rewrites of franchises. Additionally, occasional disputes arise between the Company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a McDonalds franchise.  ##TABLE_START   Suppliers ##TABLE_END The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries do not supply, with minor exceptions outside the U.S., food, paper or related items to any McDonalds restaurants. The Company relies upon numerous independent suppliers that are required to meet and maintain the Companys high standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company and its suppliers which include, by way of example, compliance with product specifications and the Companys business relationship with suppliers. In addition, disputes occasionally arise on a number of issues between the Company and individuals or entities who claim that they should be (or should have been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the Companys restaurants. ##TABLE_START   Employees ##TABLE_END Hundreds of thousands of people are employed by the Company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, thousands of people from time to time seek employment in such restaurants.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants. Of the 32,478 restaurants in 117 countries at year-end 2009, 26,216 were operated by franchisees (including 19,020 operated by conventional franchisees, 3,160 operated by developmental licensees and 4,036 operated by foreign affiliated markets (affiliates)primarily in Japan) and 6,262 were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and dcor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market. We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. However, directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In our Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced Systemwide. We continually review our mix of Company-operated and franchised (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and affiliated) restaurants to help maximize overall performance. The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and may include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (U.S.), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA). In addition, throughout this report we present Other Countries  Corporate that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 35%, 41% and 19% of total revenues, respectively. France, Germany and the United Kingdom (U.K.), collectively, account for approximately 55% of Europes revenues; and Australia, China and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for over 50% of APMEAs revenues. These six markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise over 70% of total revenues. The Company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the McDonalds restaurant business as we believe opportunities remain for long-term growth. Accordingly, in 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox Automated Retail, LLC (Redbox) for total consideration of $140 million. In 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K.-based Pret A Manger for cash proceeds of $229 million. In connection with both sales, the Company recognized nonoperating gains. During 2007, the Company sold its investment in Boston Market. As a result of the disposal, Boston Markets results of operations and transaction gain are reflected as discontinued operations. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had disposed of all non-McDonalds restaurant businesses. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, restaurant margins and returns. ##TABLE_START   Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because they believe this better represents the Companys underlying business trends. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Companys initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. McDonalds reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal. In 2008, there was an incremental full day of sales and guest counts due to leap year. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Companys financial performance because these sales are the ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START   basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the adjusted cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation assumes a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. ##TABLE_END STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The strength of the alignment between the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System) has been key to McDonalds success over the years. This business model enables McDonalds to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve. In addition, it facilitates our ability to identify, implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers changing needs and preferences. McDonalds customer-focused Plan to Winwhich is centered around being better, not just biggerprovides a common framework for our global business yet allows for local adaptation. Through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five key drivers of exceptional customer experiencesPeople, Products, Place, Price and Promotionwe have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown sales and customer visits in each of the last six years. This Plan, coupled with financial discipline, has delivered strong results for shareholders. We have exceeded our long-term, constant currency financial targets of average annual Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%; average annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%; and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the Plans implementation in 2003, after adjusting 2007 for the Latin America developmental license transaction. Given the size and scope of our global business, we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable, while keeping us focused on making the best decisions for the long-term benefit of shareholders. In 2009, we continued to elevate the customer experience by remaining focused on the Companys key global success factors of branded affordability, menu variety and beverage choice, convenience and daypart expansion, ongoing restaurant reinvestment and operations excellence. Locally-relevant initiatives around these factors successfully resonated with consumers driving increases in sales, customer visits and market share in many countries despite challenging global economies and a contracting informal eating out market. As a result, each reportable segment contributed to 2009 global comparable sales and guest counts, which increased 3.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In the U.S., we grew sales and market share with comparable sales up for the 7th consecutive year, rising 2.6% in 2009. This performance was the result of a continued focus on classic menu favorites such as the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder, increased emphasis on everyday affordability, and the national marketing launch of the new McCaf premium coffees and premium Angus Third Pounder. Complementing these efforts were our strategies related to convenient locations, extended hours, efficient drive-thru service and value-oriented local beverage promotions. In conjunction with the introduction of the McCaf premium coffees, reinvestment was needed in many restaurants to accommodate the new equipment required to prepare these beverages as well as facilitate the national introduction of smoothies and frapps in mid-2010. In most cases, this reinvestment involved expanding and optimizing the efficiency of the drive-thru booth, enabling us to better serve even more customers faster. In Europe, comparable sales rose 5.2%, marking the 6th consecutive year of comparable sales increases. This performance reflected Europes strategic priorities to upgrade the customer and employee experience, enhance local relevance, and build brand transparency. Initiatives surrounding these priorities encompassed: leveraging our tiered menu featuring locally relevant selections of premium, classic core and everyday affordable menu offerings as well as dessert and limited-time food promotions; and reimaging nearly 900 restaurants including adding about 290 McCafsan upscale area with coffeehouse-style ambiance inside an existing McDonalds restaurant. In addition, we addressed growing interest in portable snack offerings with platforms such as the Little Tasters in the U.K., launched breakfast in Germany and increased our convenience with extended hours. In order to support greater menu variety, we completed the roll-out of a new more efficient kitchen operating system in substantially all of our European restaurants. Finally, we enhanced customer trust in our brand through communications that emphasized the quality and origin of McDonalds food and our sustainable business practices. In APMEA, we continued to execute our four growth platforms of breakfast, convenience, core menu and value. Comparable sales rose 3.4% primarily due to the ongoing momentum of our business in Australia where multiple initiatives surrounding menu variety including the launch of the premium Angus burger, greater convenience and reimaging further strengthened our brand relevance. In addition, across the segment, we enhanced our convenience by increasing the number of restaurants open 24-hours to over 4,600, expanding delivery service to more than 1,300 locations including about 300 in China, and enhancing drive-thru efficiency. We sustained the momentum of our breakfast business, currently in about 75% of our restaurants, by increasing customer awareness and visit frequency with the launch of premium roast coffee in key markets like Japan and China and promoting it through successful sampling programs. We continued to appeal to customers with branded affordability menus, especially our value lunch platforms, and highlighted classic menu favorites like the Quarter Pounder. Our customer-centered strategies seek to optimize price, product mix and promotion as a means to drive sales and profits. This approach is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and effectively managing restaurant-level costs by leveraging our scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management practices. Our ability to successfully execute our strategies in every area of the world contributed to improved profitability as measured by combined operating margin of 30.1% in 2009, an improvement of 2.7 percentage points over 2008. Strong global performance positively impacted cash from operations, which totaled $5.8 billion in 2009. Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us significant flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders. About $2.0 billion of cash  from operations was invested in our business primarily to open 868 restaurants (511 net, after 357 closings) and reimage about 1,850 existing locations. After these capital expenditures, we returned our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In 2009, we returned $5.1 billion consisting of $2.2 billion in dividends and $2.9 billion in share repurchases. This brought the total return to shareholders to $16.6 billion under our $15 billion to $17 billion target for 2007 through 2009. Cash from operations continues to benefit from our evolution toward a more heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owner/operators is a very stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs, and is less capital-intensive. In addition, we believe locally-owned and operated restaurants help us maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantage, making McDonalds not just a global brand but also a locally-relevant one. To that end, for 2008 and 2009 combined, we refranchised about 1,100 restaurants, increasing the percent of restaurants franchised worldwide to 81%. Refranchising impacts our consolidated financial statements as follows: ##TABLE_START   Consolidated revenues are initially reduced because we collect rent and royalty as a percent of sales from a refranchised restaurant instead of 100% of its sales. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Company-operated margin dollars decline while franchised margin dollars increase. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Margin percentages are affected depending on the sales and cost structures of the restaurants refranchised. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Other operating (income) expense fluctuates as we recognize gains and/or losses resulting from sales of restaurants. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Combined operating margin percent improves. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Return on average assets increases primarily due to a decrease in average asset balances. ##TABLE_END HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE YEAR INCLUDED: ##TABLE_START   Comparable sales grew 3.8% and guest counts rose 1.4%, building on 2008 increases of 6.9% and 3.1%, respectively. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Growth in combined operating margin of 2.7 percentage points from 27.4% in 2008 to 30.1% in 2009. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Operating income increased 6% (10% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Net income per share was $4.11, an increase of 9% (13% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Cash provided by operations totaled $5.8 billion. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 10% to $0.55 for the fourth quarterbringing the current annual dividend rate to $2.20 per share. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   One-year ROIIC was 38.0% and three-year ROIIC was 42.9% for the period ended December 31, 2009. ##TABLE_END OUTLOOK FOR 2010 We will continue to drive success in 2010 and beyond by remaining focused on our better, not just bigger strategy and the key drivers of exceptional customer experiencesPeople, Products, Place, Price and Promotion. Our global System is energized by our ongoing momentum, strong competitive position and growth opportunities. We intend to further differentiate our brand, increase customer visits and grow market share by pursuing initiatives in three key areas: service enhancement, restaurant reimaging and menu innovation. These efforts will include leveraging technology to make it easier for restaurant staff to quickly and accurately serve customers, accelerating our interior and exterior reimaging efforts and innovating at every tier of our menu to deliver great taste and value to customers. As we execute along these priorities and remain disciplined in operations and financial management, we expect to increase McDonalds brand relevance, widen our competitive lead and, in turn, grow sales, profits and returns. As we do so, we are confident we can meet or exceed the long-term constant currency financial targets previously discussed despite expectations for a continued challenging global economic environment in 2010. In the U.S., our strategies include strengthening our core menu and value offerings, aggressively pursuing new growth opportunities in chicken, breakfast, beverages and snacking options, and elevating the brand experience. Our initiatives include highlighting the enduring appeal of core menu classics such as the Big Mac, emphasizing the value our menu offers all-day-long including the new breakfast value menu, and encouraging the trial of new products with the Mac Snack Wrap andby mid-yearfrapps and smoothies. In addition, our plans to elevate the brand experience encompass updating our technology with a new point of sale system, enhancing restaurant manager and crew retention and productivity, and initiating a multi-year program to contemporize the interiors and exteriors of our restaurants through reimaging, completing about 500 in 2010. These efforts combined with the convenience of our locations, optimized drive-thru service, free wireless service and longer operating hours will further reinforce McDonalds position as an easy, enjoyable eating-out experience. Our plans for Europe are focused on building market share as we continue to execute along Europes three key priorities. This includes upgrading our restaurant ambiance by reimaging approximately 1,000 restaurants, primarily in France and the U.K., as we make progress toward our goal to reimage more than 85% of our restaurants by the end of 2011. In addition, we expect to leverage technologies such as self-order kiosks, hand-held order devices and drive-thru customer order displays to enhance the customer experience and help speed service. We will further enhance our local relevance by complementing our tiered-menu with limited-time food events as well as new snack and dessert options. Finally, we will remain approachable and accessible as we continue to educate consumers about the quality and origin of our food and communicate our sustainable business practices. In APMEA, we will execute initiatives that best support our goal to be customers first choice for eating out: convenience, core menu, branded affordability, improved operations and reimaging. Our convenience initiatives include leveraging the success of 24-hour or extended operating hours, expanding delivery service and building drive-thru traffic. At the same time, we will continue to elevate the role of our classic core and breakfast menus, complementing both with locally-relevant food news. We will maximize the impact of our everyday affordability platforms with mid-tier and value lunch programs and intensify our focus on operations to drive efficiencies. In addition, we will accelerate our reimaging efforts using a set of standard interior and exterior designs. Finally, given its size and long-term  potential, we will continue to aggressively open new restaurants in China with a goal of opening about 600 restaurants over the next three years. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our mix of Company-operated and franchised restaurants and expect to refranchise restaurants when and where appropriate. As previously discussed, our evolution toward a more heavily franchised, less capital-intensive business model has favorable implications for the strength and stability of our cash flow, the amount of capital we invest and long-term returns. As a result, we expect free cash flowcash from operations less capital expenditureswill continue to grow in the future. We remain committed to returning all this cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases over the long term. We will remain disciplined financially as we seek to maximize the impact of all of our spending from selling, general  administrative expenses to capital expenditures. In making capital allocation decisions, our goal is to elevate the McDonalds experience to drive sustainable growth in sales and market share while earning strong returns. To that end, about half of the $2.4 billion of planned 2010 capital expenditures will be invested to reimage existing restaurants with the other half primarily used to build new locations. McDonalds does not provide specific guidance on net income per share. The following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Companys results: ##TABLE_START   Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add nearly 2 percentage points to 2010 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 609 net traditional restaurants added in 2009. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would increase annual net income per share by about 3 cents. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   With about 75% of McDonalds grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Companys commodity costs. For the full year 2010, the total basket of goods cost is expected to be relatively flat in the U.S. and Europe. Some volatility may be experienced between quarters in the normal course of business, with more favorable comparisons in the first half of the year. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The Company expects full-year 2010 selling, general  administrative expenses to be relatively flat, in constant currencies, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   although fluctuations will be experienced between quarters due to certain items in 2010 such as the Vancouver Winter Olympics and the biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention in April. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense in 2010 to increase slightly compared with 2009. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   A significant part of the Companys operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 45% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the Companys operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction compared with 2009, the Companys annual net income per share would change by about 17 to 19 cents. At current foreign currency rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to positively impact full year 2010 revenues and net income per share, with most of the benefit occurring in the first half of the year. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2010 to be approximately 29% to 31%. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   McDonalds Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate) announced plans to close approximately 430 restaurants over the next 12-18 months in conjunction with the strategic review of the markets real estate portfolio. These actions are designed to enhance the customer experience, overall profitability and returns of the market. As a result of these closures, McDonalds Corporation expects to record after tax impairment charges totaling approximately $40 million to $50 million, primarily in the first half of the year. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The Company expects capital expenditures for 2010 to be approximately $2.4 billion. About half of this amount will be reinvested in existing restaurants, including the reimaging of over 2,000 locations worldwide. The rest will primarily be used to open about 1,000 restaurants (975 traditional and 25 satellites). These restaurant numbers include new unit openings (about 350 restaurants) in affiliated and developmental licensed markets, such as Japan and Latin America, where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of about 325 restaurants (475 net traditional additions and 150 net satellite closings), which reflect the McDonalds Japan closings. ##TABLE_END  Consolidated Operating Results Operating results ##TABLE_START   2009     2008     2007  Dollars in millions, except per share data  Amount   Increase/ (decrease)      Amount   Increase/ (decrease)      Amount  Revenues        Sales by Company-operated restaurants  $ 15,459   (7 )%   $ 16,561    %   $ 16,611  Revenues from franchised restaurants   7,286   5      6,961   13      6,176  Total revenues   22,745   (3 )     23,522   3      22,787  Operating costs and expenses        Company-operated restaurant expenses   12,651   (7 )    13,653   (1 )    13,742  Franchised restaurantsoccupancy expenses   1,302   6     1,230   8     1,140  Selling, general  administrative expenses   2,234   (5 )    2,355        2,367  Impairment and other charges (credits), net   (61 )  nm     6   nm     1,670  Other operating (income) expense, net   (222 )  (35 )     (165 )  nm      (11 ) Total operating costs and expenses   15,904   (7 )     17,079   (10 )     18,908  Operating income   6,841   6     6,443   66     3,879  Interest expense   473   (9 )    523   27     410  Nonoperating (income) expense, net   (24 )  69     (78 )  25     (103 ) Gain on sale of investment   (95 )  41      (160 )  nm        Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes   6,487   5      6,158   72      3,572  Provision for income taxes   1,936   5      1,845   49      1,237  Income from continuing operations   4,551   6     4,313   85     2,335  Income from discontinued operations (net of taxes of $35)                     60  Net income  $ 4,551   6 %    $ 4,313   80 %    $ 2,395  Income per common sharediluted        Continuing operations  $ 4.11   9 %   $ 3.76   95 %   $ 1.93  Discontinued operations         0.05  Net income  $ 4.11   9 %    $ 3.76   90 %    $ 1.98  Weighted-average common shares outstandingdiluted   1,107.4         1,146.0         1,211.8  ##TABLE_END nm Not meaningful. In August 2007, the Company completed the sale of its businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and 13 other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, which totaled 1,571 restaurants, to a developmental licensee organization. The Company refers to these markets as Latam. As a result of the Latam transaction, the Company receives royalties in these markets instead of a combination of Company-operated sales and franchised rents and royalties. Based on approval by the Companys Board of Directors on April 17, 2007, the Company concluded Latam was held for sale as of that date in accordance with guidance on the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in 2007, substantially all of which was noncash. The charge included $896 million for the difference between the net book value of the Latam business and approximately $675 million in cash proceeds received. This loss in value was primarily due to a historically difficult economic environment coupled with volatility experienced in many of the markets included in this transaction. The charges also included historical foreign currency translation losses of $769 million recorded in shareholders equity. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $62 million in 2007 in connection with this transaction. As a result of meeting the held for sale criteria, the Company ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to Latam effective April 17, 2007. In connection with the sale, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims, certain of which are reflected as liabilities on McDonalds Consolidated balance sheet, totaling $97 million at December 31, 2009 and $142 million at December 31, 2008. The change in the balance was primarily a result of the resolution of certain of these liabilities as well as the impact of foreign currency translation. The Company mitigates the currency impact to income of these foreign currency denominated liabilities through the use of forward foreign exchange agreements. The buyers of the Companys operations in Latam entered into a 20-year master franchise agreement that requires the buyers, among other obligations to (i) pay monthly royalties commencing at a rate of approximately 5% of gross sales of the restaurants in these markets, substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements; (ii) commit to adding approximately 150 new McDonalds restaurants by the end of 2010 and pay an initial fee for each new restaurant opened; and (iii) commit to specified annual capital expenditures for existing restaurants.  In addition to the consolidated operating results shown on the previous page, consolidated results for 2007 and adjusted growth rates for 2008 are presented in the following table excluding the impact of the Latam transaction. These results include the effect of foreign currency translation further discussed in the section titled Impact of foreign currency translation on reported results. While the Company has converted certain other markets to a developmental license arrangement, management believes the Latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction. Management believes that the adjusted operating results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented. ##TABLE_START Dollars in millions, except per share data  2009  2008  2007 (1)  Latam Transaction (1)   2007 Excluding Latam Transaction  2009 % Inc  2008 Adjusted % Inc Operating income  $6,841  $6,443  $3,879  $(1,641 )  $5,520  6  17 Income from continuing operations  4,551  4,313  2,335  (1,579 )  3,914  6  10 Income from discontinued operations    60   60   Net income  4,551  4,313  2,395  (1,579 )  3,974  6  9 Income per common share  diluted        Continuing operations (2,3)  4.11  3.76  1.93  (1.30 )  3.23  9  16 Discontinued operations    0.05   0.05   Net income (2,3)  4.11  3.76  1.98  (1.30 )  3.28  9  15 ##TABLE_END nm Not meaningful. ##TABLE_START (1) The results for the full year 2007 included impairment and other charges of $1,665 million, partly offset by a benefit of $24 million due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in Latam in mid-April 2007, and a tax benefit of $62 million. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) The following items impact the comparison of growth in diluted income per share from continuing operations and diluted net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with 2008.

Results benefited by after tax income of $87 million or $0.08 per share primarily due to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latam transaction. Results also benefited by an after tax gain of $59 million or $0.05 per share due to the sale of the Companys minority ownership interest in Redbox. Results were negatively impacted by $0.15 per share due to the effect of foreign currency translation. In 2008, net income and diluted net income per common share were $4.3 billion and $3.76. Results benefited by a $109 million or $0.09 per share after tax gain on the sale of the Companys minority ownership interest in Pret A Manger. Results also benefited by $0.09 per share due to the effect of foreign currency translation. In 2007, net income and diluted net income per common share were $2.4 billion and $1.98. Income from continuing operations was $2.3 billion or $1.93 per share, which included $1.6 billion or $1.30 per share of net expense related to the Latam transaction. This reflects an impairment charge of $1.32 per share, partly offset by a $0.02 per share benefit due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in Latam in mid-April 2007 in accordance with accounting rules. In addition, 2007 results included a net tax benefit of $288 million or $0.24 per share resulting from the completion of an IRS examination of the Companys 2003-2004 U.S. federal income tax returns, partly offset by the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Income from discontinued operations was $60 million or $0.05 per share. The Company repurchased 50.3 million shares of its stock for $2.9 billion in 2009 and 69.7 million shares for $4.0 billion in 2008, driving reductions of over 3% and 4% of total shares outstanding, respectively, net of stock option exercises. IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonalds mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2009, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results, primarily driven by the Euro, British Pound, Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. In 2008, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results, driven by the stronger Euro and most other currencies, partly offset by the weaker British Pound. In 2007, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results, primarily driven by the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar.

Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company continues to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, cash flow and returns through its refranchising strategy. For the full years 2008 and 2009 combined, the Company refranchised about 1,100 restaurants, primarily in its major markets. The shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales shift to franchised sales, where the Company receives rent and/or royalties based on a percent of sales. In 2009, constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales and expansion, partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy in certain of the Companys major markets. As a result of the refranchising strategy, franchised restaurants represent 81%, 80% and 78% of Systemwide restaurants at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2008, constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales, partly offset by the refranchising strategy and the impact of the Latam transaction. Upon completion of the Latam transaction in August 2007, the Company receives royalties based on a percent of sales in these markets instead of a combination of Company-operated sales and franchised rents and royalties.

In addition, our market-leading breakfast business contributed to revenue growth in 2008. New products introduced in 2009 included McCaf premium coffees and the Angus Third Pounder, while new products introduced in 2008 included Southern Style Chicken products, Iced Coffee and Sweet Tea. The refranchising strategy negatively impacted revenue growth in both years. Europes constant currency increases in revenues in 2009 and 2008 were primarily driven by comparable sales increases in the U.K., France and Russia (which is entirely Company-operated) as well as expansion in Russia. In both years, these increases were partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy, primarily in the U.K. and Germany. In APMEA, the constant currency increase in revenues in 2009 was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in Australia and most other Asian markets, partly offset by negative comparable sales in China. The 2008 increase was primarily driven by strong comparable sales in Australia and China, as well as positive comparable sales throughout the segment. In addition, expansion in China contributed to the increases in both years. In Other Countries  Corporate, Company-operated sales declined in 2008 while franchised revenues increased primarily as a result of the Latam transaction in August 2007. Revenues in both years were negatively impacted by the refranchising strategy in Canada.

Franchised margin dollars represented nearly 70% of the combined restaurant margins in 2009 and about 65% of the combined restaurant margins in 2008 and 2007. Franchised margin dollars increased $254 million or 4% (7% in constant currencies) in 2009 and $695 million or 14% (11% in constant currencies) in 2008. The refranchising strategy contributed to the growth in franchised margin dollars in both 2009 and 2008 and the August 2007 Latam transaction contributed to the growth in 2008.

The 2008 increase was primarily driven by positive comparable sales, partly offset by the refranchising strategy. Europes franchised margin percent decreased in 2009 as positive comparable sales were offset by higher occupancy expenses, the refranchising strategy and the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives. The 2008 increase was primarily due to strong comparable sales in most markets, partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy, higher rent expense and the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives. In APMEA, the franchised margin percent increase in 2008 was primarily driven by positive comparable sales. In Other Countries  Corporate, the franchised margin percent increased in 2008 as a result of the 2007 Latam transaction. The franchised margin percent in APMEA and, beginning in 2008, Other Countries  Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. ##TABLE_START   Company-operated margins ##TABLE_END Company-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company-operated margin dollars decreased $101 million or 3% (increased 3% in constant currencies) in 2009 and increased $39 million or 1% (decreased 1% in constant currencies) in 2008. After the Latam transaction in August 2007, there are no Company-operated restaurants remaining in Latin America. Company-operated margin dollars were negatively impacted by this transaction in 2008 and 2007 and by the refranchising strategy in 2009 and 2008. The refranchising strategy had a positive impact on the margin percent in 2009 and 2008, primarily in the U.S. and Europe.

The margin percent decreased in 2008 due to cost pressures including higher commodity and labor costs, partly offset by positive comparable sales. Europes Company-operated margin percent increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher commodity and labor costs. In 2009, local inflation and the impact of weaker currencies on the cost of certain imported products drove higher costs, primarily in Russia, and negatively impacted the Company-operated margin percent. In APMEA, the Company-operated margin percent in 2009 and 2008 increased due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs. The margin percent in 2008 was also negatively impacted by higher commodity costs. In Other Countries  Corporate, the Company-operated margin in 2007 benefited by about 100 basis points related to the discontinuation of depreciation on the assets in Latam from mid-April through July 2007. ##TABLE_START   Supplemental information regarding Company-operated restaurants ##TABLE_END We continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve these goals, but as previously stated, Company-operated restaurants are also important to our success. We report results for Company-operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs. We report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general  administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company-operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company-operated restaurants generally include gains/losses on sales of restaurant businesses and write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. We believe the following information about Company-operated restaurants in our most significant markets provides an additional perspective on this business. Management responsible for our Company-operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the Company-operated business on this basis to assess its performance. Management of the Company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix, subject to other relevant considerations. The following tables seek to illustrate the two components of our Company-operated margins. The first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations, which we refer to as Store operating margin. The second relates to the value of our Brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties. We refer to this component as Brand/real estate margin. Both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties, although rent and royalties for Company-operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation. Rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales, and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of McDonalds investment in the restaurant. Royalty rates may also vary by market. As shown in the following tables, in disaggregating the components of our Company-operated margins, certain costs with respect to Company-operated restaurants are reflected in Brand/real estate margin. Those costs consist of rent payable by McDonalds to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy  other operating expenses recorded in the Consolidated statement of income. Store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses, and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating Brand/real estate margin.  While we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our Company-operated business, it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In particular, as noted previously, we do not allocate selling, general  administrative expenses to our Company-operated business. However, we believe that a range of $40,000 to $50,000 per restaurant, on average, is a typical range of costs to support this business in the U.S. The actual costs in markets outside the U.S. will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market. These costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant. ##TABLE_START           U.S.             Europe  Dollars in millions  2009   2008   2007      2009   2008   2007  As reported        Number of Company-operated restaurants at year end   1,578    1,782    2,090     2,001    2,024    2,177  Sales by Company-operated restaurants  $ 4,295   $ 4,636   $ 4,682    $ 6,721   $ 7,424   $ 6,817  Company-operated margin  $ 832   $ 856   $ 876     $ 1,240   $ 1,340   $ 1,205  Store operating margin        Company-operated margin  $ 832   $ 856   $ 876    $ 1,240   $ 1,340   $ 1,205  Plus:        Outside rent expense (1)   65    74    82     222    254    248  Depreciation  buildings  leasehold improvements (1)   70    70    78     100    110    107  Less:        Rent  royalties (2)   (634 )   (684 )   (691 )     (1,306 )   (1,435 )   (1,294 ) Store operating margin  $ 333   $ 316   $ 345     $ 256   $ 269   $ 266  Brand/real estate margin        Rent  royalties (2)  $ 634   $ 684   $ 691    $ 1,306   $ 1,435   $ 1,294  Less:        Outside rent expense (1)   (65 )   (74 )   (82 )    (222 )   (254 )   (248 ) Depreciation  buildings  leasehold improvements (1)   (70 )   (70 )   (78 )     (100 )   (110 )   (107 ) Brand/real estate margin  $ 499   $ 540   $ 531     $ 984   $ 1,071   $ 939  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Represents certain costs recorded as occupancy  other operating expenses in the Consolidated statement of income  rent payable by McDonalds to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements.

In 2008, expenses included costs related to the Beijing Summer Olympics and the Companys biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention. The 2008 constant currency change benefited by 3 percentage points due to the 2007 Latam transaction.

Selling, general  administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales were 3.1% in 2009 compared with 3.3% in 2008 and 3.7% in 2007. Management believes that analyzing selling, general  administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales, as well as revenues, is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support Systemwide restaurants.  IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER CHARGES (CREDITS), NET On a pretax basis, the Company recorded impairment and other charges (credits), net of ($61) million in 2009, $6 million in 2008 and $1.7 billion in 2007. Management does not include these items when reviewing business performance trends because we do not believe these items are indicative of expected ongoing results.

The Company also recognized a tax benefit in 2009 in connection with this income, mainly related to the release of a tax valuation allowance. In 2007, the Company recorded $1.7 billion of pretax impairment charges related to the Companys sale of its Latam businesses to a developmental licensee organization.

The Companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. The Company realized higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses in 2009 and 2008 compared with 2007 primarily as a result of selling more Company-operated restaurants in connection with the refranchising strategy in the Companys major markets. ##TABLE_START   Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates ##TABLE_END Unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control. The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonalds share of results. For foreign affiliated markets  primarily Japan  results are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonalds share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. are reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. Results in 2009 and 2008 reflected improved results from our Japanese affiliate. 2009 results also benefited from the stronger Japanese Yen. ##TABLE_START   Asset dispositions and other expense ##TABLE_END Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for store closings, uncollectible receivables and other miscellaneous income and expenses. Asset dispositions in 2009 and 2008 reflected lower losses on restaurant closings and property disposals compared with 2007.

This impact reflects an impairment charge of $1,665 million, partly offset by a benefit of $24 million due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in Latam in mid-April 2007. In order to provide managements view of the underlying business performance, results are also shown excluding the impact of the Latam transaction. ##TABLE_END Results for 2009 included $65 million of income in Other Countries  Corporate primarily related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latam transaction. This benefit positively impacted the growth in total operating income by 1 percentage point. In the U.S., 2009 and 2008 results increased primarily due to higher franchised margin dollars. In Europe, results for 2009 and 2008 were driven by strong performance in France, the U.K. and Russia. Positive results in Germany and most other markets also contributed to the operating income increase in 2008. In APMEA, results for 2009 were driven primarily by strong results in Australia and expansion in China. Results for 2008 were driven by strong results in Australia and China, and positive performance in most other markets. ##TABLE_START   Combined operating margin ##TABLE_END Combined operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. Combined operating margin for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was 30.1%, 27.4% and 17.0%, respectively. Impairment and other charges negatively impacted the 2007 combined operating margin by 7.4 percentage points. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense for 2009 decreased primarily due to lower average interest rates, and to a lesser extent, weaker foreign currencies, partly offset by higher average debt levels. Interest expense for 2008 increased primarily due to higher average debt levels, and to a lesser extent, higher average interest rates.

Translation and hedging activity primarily relates to net gains or losses on certain hedges that reduce the exposure to variability on certain intercompany foreign currency cash flow streams. Other expense primarily consists of gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, amortization of debt issuance costs and other nonoperating income and expenses. Interest income decreased for 2009 primarily due to lower average interest rates, while 2008 decreased primarily due to lower average interest rates and average cash balances. GAIN ON SALE OF INVESTMENT In 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox to Coinstar, Inc., the majority owner, for total consideration of $140 million. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $95 million (after tax$59 million or $0.05 per share). In 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K.-based Pret A Manger. In connection with the sale, the Company received cash proceeds of $229 million and recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $160 million (after tax$109 million or $0.09 per share). PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES In 2009, 2008 and 2007, the reported effective income tax rates were 29.8%, 30.0% and 34.6%, respectively. In 2009, the effective income tax rate benefited by 0.7 percentage points primarily due to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latam transaction. In 2007, the effective income tax rate was impacted by about 4 percentage points as a result of the following items: ##TABLE_START   A negative impact due to a minimal tax benefit of $62 million related to the Latam impairment charge of $1,641 million. This benefit was minimal due to the Companys inability to utilize most of the capital losses generated by this transaction in 2007. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   A positive impact due to a benefit of $316 million resulting from the completion of an IRS examination, partly offset by $28 million of expense related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. ##TABLE_END Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.4 billion in both 2009 and 2008.  Substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the U.S. and other profitable markets. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Over the last several years, the Company has continued to focus its management and financial resources on the McDonalds restaurant business as it believes the opportunities for long-term growth remain significant. Accordingly, during third quarter 2007, the Company sold its investment in Boston Market. As a result of the disposal, Boston Markets results of operations and transaction gain are reflected as discontinued operations. In connection with the sale, the Company received proceeds of approximately $250 million and recorded a gain of $69 million after tax. In addition, Boston Markets net loss for 2007 was $9 million. ACCOUNTING CHANGES ##TABLE_START   Sabbatical leave ##TABLE_END In 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on accounting for sabbatical leave, codified in the Compensation  General Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). Under this guidance, compensation costs associated with a sabbatical should be accrued over the requisite service period, assuming certain conditions are met. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2007, as required and accordingly, recorded a $36 million cumulative adjustment, net of tax, to decrease the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. The annual impact to earnings is not significant. ##TABLE_START   Income tax uncertainties ##TABLE_END In 2006, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, codified primarily in the Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. The guidance also covers derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2007, as required. As a result of the implementation, the Company recorded a $20 million cumulative adjustment to increase the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. The guidance requires that a liability associated with an unrecognized tax benefit be classified as a long-term liability except for the amount for which cash payment is anticipated within one year. Upon adoption of the guidance, $339 million of tax liabilities, net of deposits, were reclassified from current to long-term and included in other long-term liabilities. ##TABLE_START   Fair value measurements ##TABLE_END In 2006, the FASB issued guidance on fair value measurements, codified primarily in the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This guidance does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The provisions of the guidance, as issued, were effective January 1, 2008. However, in February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date for one year for certain non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (i.e., at least annually). The Company adopted the required provisions related to debt and derivatives as of January 1, 2008 and adopted the remaining required provisions for non-financial assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2009. The effect of adoption was not significant in either period. ##TABLE_START   Subsequent events ##TABLE_END In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance on subsequent events, codified in the Subsequent Events Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. The guidance also indicates the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, as well as the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The Company adopted this guidance beginning in the second quarter 2009. The adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial statements, besides the additional disclosure. ##TABLE_START   Variable interest entities and consolidation ##TABLE_END In June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance on variable interest entities and consolidation, codified primarily in the Consolidation Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance modifies the method for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity as well as the methods permitted for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. In addition, this guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and enhanced disclosures related to a companys involvement with a variable interest entity. This guidance was effective beginning January 1, 2010, and we do not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Cash Flows The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $5.8 billion and $5.9 billion in 2009 and 2008, respectively, and exceeded capital expenditures by $3.8 billion in both years. In 2009, cash provided by operations decreased $166 million or 3% compared with 2008 despite increased operating results, primarily due to higher income tax payments, higher noncash income items and the receipt of $143 million in 2008 related to the completion of an IRS examination. In 2008, cash provided by operations increased $1.0 billion or 21% compared with 2007 primarily due to increased operating results and changes in working capital, partly due to lower income tax payments and the receipt of $143 million related to the IRS examination.  Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.7 billion in 2009, an increase of $31 million compared with 2008. This reflects lower proceeds from sales of investments, restaurant businesses and property, offset by lower capital expenditures, primarily in the U.S. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.6 billion in 2008, an increase of $475 million compared with 2007. Investing activities in 2008 reflected lower proceeds from sales of investments and higher capital expenditures, partly offset by higher proceeds from the sales of restaurant businesses and property and lower expenditures on purchases of restaurant businesses. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.4 billion in 2009, an increase of $307 million compared with 2008, primarily due to lower net debt issuances, an increase in the common stock dividend and lower proceeds from stock option exercises, partly offset by lower treasury stock purchases. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.1 billion in 2008, an increase of $118 million compared with 2007, which reflected lower proceeds from stock option exercises, mostly offset by higher net debt issuances. As a result of the above activity, the Companys cash and equivalents balance decreased $267 million in 2009 to $1.8 billion, compared with an increase of $82 million in 2008. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In 2009, the Company opened 824 traditional restaurants and 44 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 215 traditional restaurants and 142 satellite restaurants. In 2008, the Company opened 918 traditional restaurants and 77 satellite restaurants and closed 209 traditional restaurants and 196 satellite restaurants. The majority of restaurant openings and closings occurred in the major markets in both years. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure. Systemwide restaurants at year end (1) ##TABLE_START    2009  2008  2007 U.S.  13,980  13,918  13,862 Europe  6,785  6,628  6,480 APMEA  8,488  8,255  7,938 Other Countries  Corporate  3,225  3,166  3,097 Total  32,478  31,967  31,377 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Includes satellite units at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 as follows: U.S. 1,155, 1,169, 1,233; Europe241, 226, 214; APMEA (primarily Japan)1,263, 1,379, 1,454; Other Countries  Corporate464, 447, 439. ##TABLE_END Approximately 65% of Company-operated restaurants and about 80% of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2009. Franchisees operated 81% of the restaurants at year-end 2009. Capital expenditures decreased $184 million or 9% in 2009 primarily due to fewer restaurant openings, lower reinvestment in existing restaurants in the U.S. and the impact of foreign currency translation. Capital expenditures increased $189 million or 10% in 2008 primarily due to higher investment in new restaurants in Europe and APMEA. In both years, capital expenditures reflected the Companys commitment to grow sales at existing restaurants, including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in many markets around the world and, to a lesser extent in 2009, the Combined Beverage Business in the U.S. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented 70% to 75% of the total in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts. Capital expenditures ##TABLE_START In millions  2009  2008  2007 New restaurants  $ 809  $ 897  $ 687 Existing restaurants   1,070   1,152   1,158 Other (1)   73   87   102 Total capital expenditures  $ 1,952  $ 2,136  $ 1,947 Total assets  $ 30,225  $ 28,462  $ 29,392 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Primarily corporate equipment and other office related expenditures. ##TABLE_END New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long-term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $2.7 million in 2009. The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2009 and 2008. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS In 2009, the Company returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid, bringing the three-year total to $16.6 billion under the Companys $15 billion to $17 billion cash returned to shareholders target for 2007 through 2009. Shares repurchased and dividends ##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data  2009  2008  2007 Number of shares repurchased   50.3   69.7   77.1 Shares outstanding at year end   1,077   1,115   1,165 Dividends declared per share  $ 2.05  $ 1.625  $ 1.50 Dollar amount of shares repurchased  $ 2,854  $ 3,981  $ 3,949 Dividends paid   2,235   1,823   1,766 Total returned to shareholders  $ 5,089  $ 5,804  $ 5,715 ##TABLE_END In September 2007, the Companys Board of Directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date. In September 2009, the Companys Board of Directors terminated the then-existing share repurchase program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program that authorizes the purchase of up to $10 billion of the Companys  outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. In 2009, approximately 50 million shares were repurchased for $2.9 billion, of which 8 million shares or $0.5 billion were purchased under the new program. The Company reduced its shares outstanding at year end by over 3% compared with 2008, net of stock option exercises. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 34 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2009 full year dividend of $2.05 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.50 per share, with an increase to $0.55 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 10% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $2.20 per share annual dividend rate and reflects the Companys confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors. Financial Position and Capital Resources TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS Total assets increased $1.8 billion or 6% in 2009. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $677 million in 2009. Over 70% of total assets were in major markets at year-end 2009. Net property and equipment increased $1.3 billion in 2009 and represented over 70% of total assets at year end. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net property and equipment increased $476 million primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation, the impact of refranchising and asset retirements related to reimaging. Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while income from continuing operations is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Assets of discontinued operations are excluded from average assets since operating income excludes results from discontinued operations. Returns on assets and equity ##TABLE_START    2009   2008   2007  Return on average assets  23.4 %  21.8 %  13.2 % Return on average common equity  34.0   30.6   15.1  ##TABLE_END In 2009, 2008 and 2007, return on average assets and return on average common equity both benefited from strong global operating results. During 2010, the Company will continue to concentrate restaurant openings and invest new capital in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long-term growth. In 2009, impairment and other charges (credits), net benefited return on average assets and return on average common equity by 0.2 percentage points and 0.7 percentage points, respectively. In 2007, impairment and other charges (credits), net reduced return on average assets by 5.4 percentage points. Impairment and other charges (credits), net partly offset by the 2007 net tax benefit resulting from the completion of an IRS examination, reduced return on average common equity by 8.5 percentage points in 2007. Operating income, as reported, does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by 2.0 percentage points, 1.9 percentage points and 1.3 percentage points in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. FINANCING AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2009 totaled $10.6 billion, compared with $10.2 billion at December 31, 2008. The net increase in 2009 was primarily due to net issuances of $219 million and changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt of $128 million.

The Companys key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table. While the Company targets these metrics for ease of focus, it also considers similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt. Total adjusted debt, a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above, includes debt outstanding on the Companys balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases. Based on their most recent calculations, these agencies add between $6 billion and $12 billion to debt for lease capitalization purposes, which increases total debt as a percent of total capitalization and reduces cash provided by operations as a percent of total debt for credit rating purposes. The Company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments. These adjustments include: excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents; excluding certain Company-operated restaurant lease agreements outside the U.S. that are cancelable with minimal penalties (representing approximately 30% of Company-operated restaurant minimum rents outside the U.S., based on the Companys estimate); capitalizing non-restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense; and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent  payments due to the Company from franchisees operating on leased sites. Based on this calculation, for credit analysis purposes, approximately $4 billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Under existing authorization from the Companys Board of Directors, at December 31, 2009, the Company has $5 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to registered debt securities on a U.S. shelf registration statement and a Euro Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $1.3 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and Euromarket (see Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2010 is approximately $607 million of long-term corporate debt. In 2010, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. The Company also has $599 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings outstanding at year-end. Historically, the Company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt. Although there are continued constraints in the overall financial markets on available credit, the Companys ability to raise funding in the long-term and short-term debt capital markets has not been adversely affected. In January 2009, the Company issued $400 million of 10-year U.S. Dollar-denominated notes at a coupon rate of 5.0%, and $350 million of 30-year U.S. Dollar-denominated bonds at a coupon rate of 5.7%. In June 2009, the Company issued 300 million Euro ($423 million) of 7-year notes at a coupon rate of 4.25%. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All exchange agreements are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $4.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. In addition, where practical, the Companys restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2009, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position. The Companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures ##TABLE_START In millions of U.S. Dollars  2009  2008 Euro  $ 5,151  $ 4,551 Australian Dollars   1,460   1,023 Canadian Dollars   981   795 British Pounds Sterling   679   785 Russian Ruble   501   407 ##TABLE_END The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2009 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2009 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Companys borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of  December 31, 2009. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details. ##TABLE_START    Contractual cash outflows    Contractual cash inflows In millions  Operating leases  Debt obligations (1)     Minimum rent under franchise arrangements 2010  $ 1,119  $ 18   $ 2,294 2011  1,047  613   2,220 2012  963  2,188   2,156 2013  885  658   2,078 2014  806  460   1,987 Thereafter  5,897  6,562    15,278 Total  $10,717  $10,499    $26,013 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) The maturities reflect reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $1.2 billion, as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in 2012. Debt obligations do not include $80 million of noncash fair value hedging adjustments because these adjustments have no impact on the obligation at maturity, as well as $196 million of accrued interest. ##TABLE_END The Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of IRS limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the Companys qualified Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $397 million at December 31, 2009 and are reflected on McDonalds Consolidated balance sheet as follows: other long-term liabilities$362 million, and accrued payroll and other liabilities$35 million. Total liabilities for international retirement plans at December 31, 2009 were $184 million and were primarily reflected in other long-term liabilities. The Company has also recorded $492 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009, of which $286 million is included in other long-term liabilities and $206 million is included in deferred income taxes on the Consolidated balance sheet. Other Matters CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: ##TABLE_START   Property and equipment ##TABLE_END Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. ##TABLE_START   Share-based compensation ##TABLE_END The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, such as the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of the Companys stock over the expected life, which significantly impact the assumed fair value. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. ##TABLE_START   Long-lived assets impairment review ##TABLE_END Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Companys experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Companys estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual country) with goodwill currently at risk of impairment. When the Company sells an existing business to a developmental licensee, it determines when these businesses are held for sale in accordance with guidance on the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Impairment charges on assets held for sale are recognized when management and, if required, the Companys Board of Directors have approved and committed to a  plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal, the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than the assets net book value, among other factors. An impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the net book value of the business (including foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity) and the estimated cash sales price, less costs of disposal. An alternative accounting policy would be to recharacterize some or all of any loss as an intangible asset and amortize it to expense over future periods based on the term of the relevant licensing arrangement and as revenue is recognized for royalties and initial fees. Under this alternative for the 2007 Latam transaction, approximately $900 million of the $1.7 billion impairment charge could have been recharacterized as an intangible asset and amortized over the franchise term of 20 years, resulting in about $45 million of expense annually. This policy would be based on a view that the consideration for the sale consists of two componentsthe cash sales price and the future royalties and initial fees. The Company bases its accounting policy on managements determination that royalties payable under its developmental license arrangements are substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements. The Company does not believe it would be appropriate to recognize an asset for the right to receive market-based fees in future periods, particularly given the continuing support and services provided to the licensees. Therefore, the Company believes that the recognition of an impairment charge based on the net cash sales price reflects the substance of the sale transaction. ##TABLE_START   Litigation accruals ##TABLE_END From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. ##TABLE_START   Income taxes ##TABLE_END The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. During 2008, the IRS examination of the Companys 2005-2006 U.S. tax returns was completed. The tax provision impact associated with the completion of this examination was not significant. During 2007, the Company recorded a $316 million benefit as a result of the completion of an IRS examination of the Companys 2003-2004 U.S. tax returns. The Companys 2007-2008 U.S. tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the examination is expected in 2010. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $9.2 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If managements intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICESINFLATION The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. RECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Companys incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period. The denominator is the weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one- or three-year period. Adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the Boston Market, Chipotle, Latam, Pret A Manger and Redbox transactions. The weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarters investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2009 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2009 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2008 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full year impact on 2009 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2008 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average.  The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows (dollars in millions) : One-year ROIIC Calculation ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009  2008  Incremental change  NUMERATOR:    Operating income  $ 6,841.0  $ 6,442.9  $ 398.1  Depreciation and amortization   1,216.2   1,207.8  8.4  Currency translation (1)        324.3  Incremental adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates)  $ 730.8  DENOMINATOR:    Weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities (2)  $1,893.8  Currency translation (1)        31.1  Weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates)  $1,924.9  One-year ROIIC (3)        38.0 % ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Represents one-year weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the adjusted cash used for investing activities for each quarter in the two-year period ended December 31, 2009. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Years ended December 31,     2008   2009  Cash used for investing activities  $ 1,624.7   $ 1,655.3  Less: Cash generated from investing activities related to Pret A Manger transaction   (229.4 )  Less: Cash generated from investing activities related to Redbox transaction       (144.9 ) Adjusted cash used for investing activities  $ 1,854.1   $ 1,800.2  AS A PERCENT   Quarters ended:   March 31   12.5 %   87.5 % June 30   37.5    62.5  September 30   62.5    37.5  December 31   87.5    12.5  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) The impact of impairment and other charges (credits), net between 2009 and 2008 benefited the one-year ROIIC by 4.0 percentage points. ##TABLE_END  Three-year ROIIC Calculation ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2009  2006  Incremental change  NUMERATOR:    Operating income  $ 6,841.0  $ 4,433.0  $2,408.0  Depreciation and amortization (4)   1,216.2   1,191.0  25.2  Currency translation (5)        (128.6 ) Incremental adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates)  $2,304.6  DENOMINATOR:    Weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities (6)  $5,471.9  Currency translation (5)        (95.5 ) Weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates)  $5,376.4  Three-year ROIIC (7)        42.9 % ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4) Represents depreciation and amortization from continuing operations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (5) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (6) Represents three-year weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the adjusted cash used for investing activities for each quarter in the four-year period ended December 31, 2009. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Years ended December 31,     2006   2007   2008   2009  Cash used for investing activities  $ 1,274.1   $ 1,150.1   $ 1,624.7   $ 1,655.3  Less: Cash generated from investing activities related to Boston Market  Chipotle   (203.8 )   (184.3 )   Less: Cash generated from investing activities related to Latam transaction    (647.5 )   Less: Cash generated from investing activities related to Pret A Manger transaction     (229.4 )  Less: Cash generated from investing activities related to Redbox transaction               (144.9 ) Adjusted cash used for investing activities  $ 1,477.9   $ 1,981.9   $ 1,854.1   $ 1,800.2  AS A PERCENT     Quarters ended:     March 31   12.5 %   100.0 %   100.0 %   87.5 % June 30   37.5    100.0    100.0    62.5  September 30   62.5    100.0    100.0    37.5  December 31   87.5    100.0    100.0    12.5  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (7) The impact of impairment and other charges (credits), net between 2009 and 2006 benefited the three-year ROIIC by 4.4 percentage points. ##TABLE_END RISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook for 2010.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Summary of Significant Accounting Policies NATURE OF BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants in the food service industry. The Company had a minority ownership interest in U.K.-based Pret A Manger that it sold in May 2008, and a 100% ownership interest in U.S.-based Boston Market that it sold in August 2007. All restaurants are operated either by the Company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchise arrangements, and foreign affiliated markets (affiliates) and developmental licensees under license agreements. The following table presents restaurant information by ownership type: ##TABLE_START Restaurants at December 31,  2009  2008  2007 Conventional franchised  19,020  18,402  17,634 Developmental licensed  3,160  2,926  2,756 Affiliated  4,036  4,137  4,081 Franchised  26,216  25,465  24,471 Company-operated  6,262  6,502  6,906 Systemwide restaurants  32,478  31,967  31,377 ##TABLE_END CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily McDonalds Japan) are accounted for by the equity method. The Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers, and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entities is not appropriate. In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amendments to the guidance on variable interest entities and consolidation, codified primarily in the Consolidation Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). This guidance modifies the method for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity as well as the methods permitted for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. In addition, this guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and enhanced disclosures related to a companys involvement with a variable interest entity. This guidance was effective beginning January 1, 2010, and we do not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Sales by Company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis. The Company presents sales net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and may include initial fees. Continuing rent and royalties are recognized in the period earned. Initial fees are recognized upon opening of a restaurant or granting of a new franchise term, which is when the Company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise arrangement. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The functional currency of operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency. ADVERTISING COSTS Advertising costs included in operating expenses of Company-operated restaurants primarily consist of contributions to advertising cooperatives and were (in millions): 2009$650.8; 2008$703.4; 2007$718.3. Production costs for radio and television advertising are expensed when the commercials are initially aired. These production costs, primarily in the U.S., as well as other marketing-related expenses included in selling, general  administrative expenses were (in millions): 2009$94.7; 2008$79.2; 2007$87.7. In addition, significant advertising costs are incurred by franchisees through contributions to advertising cooperatives in individual markets. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Share-based compensation includes the portion vesting of all share-based payments granted based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of the Compensation  Stock Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC. Share-based compensation expense and the effect on diluted net income per common share were as follows: ##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data  2009  2008  2007 Share-based compensation expense  $ 112.9  $ 112.5  $ 142.4 After tax  $ 76.1  $ 75.1  $ 94.9 Net income per common share-diluted  $ 0.07  $ 0.07  $ 0.07 ##TABLE_END Compensation expense related to share-based awards is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in selling, general  administrative expenses in the Consolidated statement of income. As of December 31, 2009, there was $100.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for the 2009, 2008 and 2007 stock option grants. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical trends. Expected stock price volatility is generally based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock for a period approximating the expected life. The expected dividend yield is  based on the Companys most recent annual dividend payout. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life. Weighted-average assumptions ##TABLE_START    2009   2008   2007  Expected dividend yield   3.22 %   2.55 %   2.26 % Expected stock price volatility   24.4 %   24.9 %   24.7 % Risk-free interest rate   2.00 %   2.96 %   4.76 % Expected life of options In years   6.17    6.18    6.26  Fair value per option granted  $ 9.66   $ 11.85   $ 11.59  ##TABLE_END  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildingsup to 40 years; leasehold improvementsthe lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include option periods; and equipmentthree to 12 years. GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurant businesses. The Companys goodwill primarily results from purchases of McDonalds restaurants from franchisees and ownership increases in international subsidiaries or affiliates, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit (defined as each individual country). In accordance with guidance on goodwill impairment testing in the Intangibles  Goodwill and Other Topic of the FASB ASC, the Company conducts goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever an indicator of impairment exists. If an indicator of impairment exists (e.g., estimated earnings multiple value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value), the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit, generally based on discounted future cash flows, with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill and the carrying amount of goodwill. Historically, goodwill impairment has not significantly impacted the consolidated financial statements. The following table presents the 2009 activity in goodwill by segment: ##TABLE_START In millions  U.S.  Europe  APMEA (1)  Other Countries  Corporate (2)   Consolidated Balance at December 31, 2008  $ 1,149.7  $ 692.0  $276.7  $119.0   $2,237.4 Net restaurant purchases (sales)   1.9   26.1  32.1  (1.5 )  58.6 Ownership increases in subsidiaries/affiliates    34.5    34.5 Currency translation      38.1  37.6  19.0   94.7 Balance at December 31, 2009  $ 1,151.6  $ 790.7  $346.4  $136.5   $2,425.2 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) APMEA represents Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Other Countries  Corporate represents Canada, Latin America and Corporate. ##TABLE_END LONG-LIVED ASSETS In accordance with guidance on the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets in the Property Plant and Equipment Topic of the FASB ASC, long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing McDonalds restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together at a television market level in the U.S. and at a country level for each of the international markets. The Company manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurants cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment (e.g., negative operating cash flows for the most recent trailing 24-month period) exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows. Losses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal, the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses relate to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered available for sale.  When the Company sells an existing business to a developmental licensee, the licensee purchases the business, including the real estate, and uses his/her capital and local knowledge to build the McDonalds Brand and optimize sales and profitability over the long term. The sale of the business includes primarily land, buildings and improvements, and equipment, along with the franchising and leasing rights under existing agreements. Under the related developmental licensing arrangement, the Company collects a royalty based on a percent of sales, as well as initial fees, but does not have either any capital invested in the business or any commitment to invest future capital. An impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the net book value of the business (including any foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity) and the estimated cash sales price, less costs of disposal. The Company bases its accounting policy on managements determination that royalties payable under its developmental license arrangements are substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements. Therefore, the Company believes that the recognition of an impairment charge based on the net cash sales price reflects the substance of the sale transaction. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS In 2006, the FASB issued guidance in the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This guidance does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The provisions of the guidance, as issued, were effective January 1, 2008. However, in February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date for one year for certain non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (i.e., at least annually). The Company adopted the required provisions related to debt and derivatives as of January 1, 2008 and adopted the remaining required provisions for non-financial assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2009. The effect of adoption was not significant in either period. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The guidance also establishes a three-level hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: ##TABLE_START   Level 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for an identical asset or liability in an active market. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Level 2  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for a similar asset or liability in an active market or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START   Level 3  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END Certain of the Companys derivatives are valued using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate observable market parameters, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates, classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. Derivative valuations incorporate credit risk adjustments that are necessary to reflect the probability of default by the counterparty or the Company. The following table presents financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2009 by the valuation hierarchy as defined in the fair value guidance: ##TABLE_START In millions  Level 1   Level 2   Level 3  Carrying value  Cash equivalents  $455.8     $455.8  Investments  115.7 *    115.7  Derivative receivables  79.6 *  $94.5     174.1  Total assets at fair value  $651.1   $94.5     $745.6  Derivative payables     $ (7.0 )    $ (7.0 ) Total liabilities at fair value     $ (7.0 )     $ (7.0 )  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START * Includes long-term investments and derivatives that hedge market driven changes in liabilities associated with the Companys supplemental benefit plans. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis ##TABLE_END Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). At December 31, 2009, no material fair value adjustments or fair value measurements were required for non-financial assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_START   Certain financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2009, the fair value of the Companys debt obligations was estimated at $11.3 billion, compared to a carrying amount of $10.6 billion. This fair value was estimated using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated quoted market prices and are similar to Level 2 inputs within the valuation hierarchy. The Company has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt prior to maturity. The carrying amount for both cash and equivalents and notes receivable approximate fair value. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES In March 2008, the FASB issued guidance on disclosures in the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance amends and expands the previous disclosure requirements surrounding accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities to provide more qualitative and quantitative information on how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and  cash flows. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements as of January 1, 2009 on a prospective basis; accordingly, disclosures related to income and other comprehensive income (OCI) for prior periods have not been presented. The adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial statements, besides the additional disclosures. The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt and derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of these changes. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions. The Companys derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments consist mainly of interest rate exchange agreements, forward foreign currency exchange agreements and foreign currency options. Interest rate exchange agreements are entered into to manage the interest rate risk associated with the Companys fixed and floating-rate borrowings. Forward foreign currency exchange agreements and foreign currency options are entered into to mitigate the risk that forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies) will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Certain foreign currency denominated debt is used, in part, to protect the value of the Companys investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also enters into certain derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments. The Company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in selling, general  administrative expenses. In addition, the Company uses forward foreign currency exchange agreements and foreign currency exchange agreements to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign denominated assets and liabilities. Since these derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments, the changes in the fair value of these hedges are recognized immediately in nonoperating (income) expense together with the translation gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. A portion of the Companys foreign currency options (more fully described in the Cash Flow Hedging Strategy section) are undesignated as hedging instruments as the underlying foreign currency royalties are earned. All derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments are classified as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. All derivatives (including those not designated as hedging instruments) are recognized on the Consolidated balance sheet at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity date. Changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments are reflected as adjustments to OCI and/or current earnings. The following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included on the Consolidated balance sheet: ##TABLE_START    Asset derivatives  Liability derivatives  In millions  Balance sheet classification     2009  2008     Balance sheet classification  2009      2008  Derivatives designated as hedging instruments          Foreign currency options  Prepaid expenses and other current assets   $ 13.2  $ 43.8   Accrued payroll and other liabilities  $     Interest rate exchange agreements  Prepaid expenses and other current assets    1.4    Accrued payroll and other liabilities    Forward foreign currency exchange agreements  Prepaid expenses and other current assets    0.3    Accrued payroll and other liabilities   (0.1 )   $ (2.1 ) Foreign currency options  Miscellaneous other assets    5.4   5.0   Other long-term liabilities    Interest rate exchange agreements  Miscellaneous other assets     67.3   82.6    Other long-term liabilities   (3.4 )     (3.5 ) Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments      $ 87.6  $ 131.4      $ (3.5 )    $ (5.6 ) Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments          Forward foreign currency exchange agreements  Prepaid expenses and other current assets   $ 9.3    Accrued payroll and other liabilities  $ (5.4 )   $ (20.0 ) Derivatives hedging supplemental benefit plan liabilities  Miscellaneous other assets    79.6  $ 90.2   Other long-term liabilities    Foreign currency exchange agreements  Miscellaneous other assets            Other long-term liabilities   (0.5 )       Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments      $ 88.9  $ 90.2      $ (5.9 )    $ (20.0 ) Total derivatives (1 )      $ 176.5  $ 221.6      $ (9.4 )    $ (25.6 ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) The fair value of derivatives is presented on a gross basis. Accordingly, the 2009 total asset and liability fair values do not agree with the values provided in the Fair Value Measurements note, because that disclosure reflects netting adjustments of $2.4 million. ##TABLE_END  The following table presents the pretax amounts affecting income and other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2009: ##TABLE_START In millions                     Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships   (Gain) Loss Recognized in Income on Derivative      Hedged Items in Fair Value Hedge Relationships      (Gain) Loss Recognized in Income on Related Hedged Items Interest rate exchange agreements   $ 17.3    Fixed-rate debt    $(17.3) Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships   (Gain) Loss Recognized in Accumulated OCI on Derivative (Effective Portion)       (Gain) Loss Reclassified from Accumulated OCI into Income (Effective Portion)       (Gain) Loss Recognized in Income on Derivative (Amount Excluded from Effectiveness Testing and Ineffective Portion) Foreign currency options   $ 2.0    $(42.8 )   $ 27.0 Interest rate exchange agreements (1)   (2.1 )   (2.1 )   Forward foreign currency exchange agreements    1.4     (5.5 )     Total    $ 1.3     $(50.4 )    $ 27.0 Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships   (Gain) Loss Recognized in Accumulated OCI on Derivative (Effective Portion)         Foreign currency denominated debt   $ 51.3      Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments   (Gain) Loss Recognized in Income on Derivative        Forward foreign currency exchange agreements   $(12.4 )     Derivatives hedging supplemental benefit plan liabilities (2)   (2.4 )     Foreign currency options   (0.3 )     Foreign currency exchange agreements    0.5      Total    $(14.6 )     ##TABLE_END (Gains) losses recognized in income on derivatives are recorded in nonoperating (income) expense unless otherwise noted. ##TABLE_START (1) The amount of (gain) loss reclassified from accumulated OCI into income is recorded in interest expense. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) The amount of (gain) loss recognized in income on the derivatives used to hedge the supplemental benefit plan liabilities is recorded in selling, general  administrative expenses. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Fair value hedging strategy ##TABLE_END The Company enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure to changes in the fair values of certain liabilities. The fair value hedges the Company enters into consist of interest rate exchange agreements which convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt. All of the Companys interest rate exchange agreements meet the shortcut method requirements. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate exchange agreements are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying debt. No ineffectiveness has been recorded to net income related to interest rate exchange agreements designated as fair value hedges for the year ended December 31, 2009. A total of $2.1 billion of the Companys outstanding fixed-rate debt was effectively converted to floating-rate debt resulting from the use of interest rate exchange agreements.  ##TABLE_START   Cash flow hedging strategy ##TABLE_END The Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. The types of cash flow hedges the Company enters into include interest rate exchange agreements, forward foreign currency exchange agreements and foreign currency options. The Company periodically uses interest rate exchange agreements to effectively convert a portion of floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt, and the agreements are designed to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. At December 31, 2009, none of the Companys outstanding floating-rate debt was effectively converted to fixed-rate debt resulting from the use of interest rate exchange agreements. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign  currencies), the Company uses forward foreign currency exchange agreements and foreign currency options to hedge a portion of anticipated exposures. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the decline in present value of future foreign denominated royalties is offset by gains in the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange agreements and/or foreign currency options. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in the present value of future foreign denominated royalties is offset by losses in the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange agreements and/or foreign currency options. Although the fair value changes in the foreign currency options may fluctuate over the period of the contract, the Companys total loss on a foreign currency option is limited to the upfront premium paid for the contract. However, the potential gains on a foreign currency option are unlimited as the settlement value of the contract is based upon the difference between the exchange rate at inception of the contract and the spot exchange rate at maturity. In limited situations, the Company uses foreign currency option collars, which limit the potential gains and lower the upfront premium paid, to protect against currency movements. The hedges typically cover the next 12-15 months for certain exposures and are denominated in various currencies. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had derivatives outstanding with an equivalent notional amount of $608.4 million that were used to hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency denominated royalties. The Company excludes the time value of foreign currency options, as well as the discount or premium points on forward foreign currency exchange agreements from its effectiveness assessment on its cash flow hedges. As a result, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to these components, as well as the ineffectiveness of the hedges, are recognized in earnings currently. The effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is reported in the deferred hedging adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company recorded after-tax adjustments related to cash flow hedges to the deferred hedging adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. The Company recorded a net decrease of $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and net increases of $47.3 million and $8.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Based on interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2009, no material amount of the $16.5 million in cumulative deferred hedging gains at December 31, 2009, will be recognized in earnings over the next 12 months as the underlying hedged transactions are realized. ##TABLE_START   Hedge of net investment in foreign operations strategy ##TABLE_END The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders equity in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income and offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2009, a total of $3.2 billion of the Companys outstanding foreign currency denominated debt was designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. ##TABLE_START   Credit risk ##TABLE_END The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its hedging instruments. The counterparties to these agreements consist of a diverse group of financial institutions. The Company continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and adjusts positions as appropriate. The Company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2009 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2009, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability positions. INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES In 2006, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, codified primarily in the Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC . This guidance clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. The guidance also covers derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2007, as required. As a result of the implementation, the Company recorded a $20.1 million cumulative adjustment to increase the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. The guidance requires that a liability associated with an unrecognized tax benefit be classified as a long-term liability except for the amount for which cash payment is anticipated within one year. Upon adoption of the guidance, $338.7 million of net tax liabilities were reclassified from current to long-term. The Company, like other multi-national companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. Beginning in 2007, tax liabilities are recorded when, in managements judgment, a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition as prescribed by the guidance. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may be recorded depending on managements assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled. The Company records interest on unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION Diluted net income per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of  shares): 200915.2; 200819.4; 200723.5. Stock options that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutive were (in millions of shares): 20090.7; 20080.6; 20070.7. The Company has elected to exclude the pro forma deferred tax asset associated with share-based compensation in net income per share. STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS The Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. SABBATICAL LEAVE In certain countries, eligible employees are entitled to take a paid sabbatical after a predetermined period of service. In 2006, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for sabbatical leave, codified in the Compensation  General Topic of the FASB ASC. Under this guidance, compensation costs associated with a sabbatical should be accrued over the requisite service period, assuming certain conditions are met. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2007, as required and accordingly, recorded a $36.1 million cumulative adjustment, net of tax, to decrease beginning retained earnings in the first quarter 2007. The annual impact to earnings is not significant. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance on subsequent events, codified in the Subsequent Events Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. The guidance also indicates the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, as well as the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The Company adopted this guidance beginning in the second quarter 2009. The adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial statements, besides the additional disclosure. The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was February 26, 2010. There were no subsequent events that required recognition or disclosure. Property and Equipment Net property and equipment consisted of: ##TABLE_START In millions  December 31, 2009   2008  Land  $ 5,048.3   $ 4,689.6  Buildings and improvements on owned land  12,119.0    10,952.3  Buildings and improvements on leased land  11,347.9    10,788.6  Equipment, signs and seating  4,422.9    4,205.1  Other  502.4    516.8   33,440.5    31,152.4  Accumulated depreciation and amortization  (11,909.0 )   (10,897.9 ) Net property and equipment  $ 21,531.5   $ 20,254.5  ##TABLE_END  Depreciation and amortization expense related to continuing operations was (in millions): 2009$1,160.8; 2008$1,161.6; 2007$1,145.0. Discontinued Operations The Company previously operated Boston Market in the U.S., which it sold in August 2007. As a result of the disposal, Boston Markets results of operations and transaction gain are reflected as discontinued operations. In connection with the sale, the Company received proceeds of approximately $250 million and recorded a gain of $68.6 million after tax. In addition, Boston Markets net loss for 2007 was $8.5 million. Boston Markets results of operations for 2007 (exclusive of the transaction gains), which previously were included in Other Countries  Corporate, consisted of $444.1 million of revenues and a pretax loss of $17.0 million. Latam Transaction In August 2007, the Company completed the sale of its businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and 13 other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, which totaled 1,571 restaurants, to a developmental licensee organization. The Company refers to these markets as Latam. Based on approval by the Companys Board of Directors on April 17, 2007, the Company concluded Latam was held for sale as of that date in accordance with guidance on the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in 2007, substantially all of which was noncash. The total charges for the full year included $895.8 million for the difference between the net book value of the Latam business and approximately $675 million in cash proceeds received. This loss in value was primarily due to a historically difficult economic environment coupled with volatility experienced in many of the markets included in this transaction. The charges also included historical foreign currency translation losses of $769.5 million recorded in shareholders equity. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $62.0 million in connection with this transaction. The tax benefit was minimal in 2007 due to the Companys inability to utilize most of the capital losses generated by this transaction. As a result of meeting the held for sale criteria, the Company ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to Latam effective April 17, 2007. In connection with the sale, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims, certain of which are reflected on McDonalds Consolidated balance sheet (2009: other long-term liabilities$71.8 million; accrued payroll and other liabilities$25.3 million; 2008: other long-term liabilities$141.8 million). The change in the total balance was primarily a result of the resolution of certain of these liabilities as well as the impact of foreign currency translation. The Company mitigates the currency impact to income of these foreign currency denominated liabilities through the use of forward foreign exchange agreements. The buyers of the Companys operations in Latam entered into a 20-year master franchise agreement that requires the buyers, among other obligations to (i) pay monthly royalties commencing at a rate of approximately 5% of gross sales of the restaurants in these markets, substantially consistent with market  rates for similar license arrangements; (ii) commit to adding approximately 150 new McDonalds restaurants by the end of 2010 and pay an initial fee for each new restaurant opened; and (iii) commit to specified annual capital expenditures for existing restaurants.

The Company also recognized a tax benefit in 2009 in connection with this income, mainly related to the release of a tax valuation allowance. In 2007, the Company recorded $1.7 billion of pretax impairment charges related to the Companys sale of its Latam businesses to a developmental licensee organization.

The Companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. ##TABLE_START   Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates ##TABLE_END Unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control. The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonalds share of results. For foreign affiliated markets  primarily Japan  results are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonalds share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. are reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. ##TABLE_START   Asset dispositions and other expense ##TABLE_END Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for store closings, uncollectible receivables and other miscellaneous income and expenses. Gain on Sale of Investment In 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox Automated Retail, LLC to Coinstar, Inc., the majority owner, for total consideration of $139.8 million. In connection with the sale, in first quarter, the Company received initial consideration valued at $51.6 million consisting of 1.5 million shares of Coinstar common stock at an agreed to value of $41.6 million and $10 million in cash with the balance of the purchase price deferred. In subsequent quarters, the Company sold all of its holdings in the Coinstar common stock for $46.8 million and received $88.2 million in cash from Coinstar as final consideration. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $94.9 million (after tax$58.8 million or $0.05 per share). In second quarter 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K.-based Pret A Manger. In connection with the sale, the Company received cash proceeds of $229.4 million and recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $160.1 million (after tax$109.0 million or $0.09 per share). Contingencies From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Franchise Arrangements Conventional franchise arrangements generally include a lease and a license and provide for payment of initial fees, as well as continuing rent and royalties to the Company based upon a percent of sales with minimum rent payments that parallel the Companys underlying leases and escalations (on properties that are leased). Under this arrangement, franchisees are granted the right to operate a restaurant using the McDonalds System and, in most cases, the use of a restaurant facility, generally for a period of 20 years. These franchisees pay related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. Affiliates  and developmental licensees operating under license agreements pay a royalty to the Company based upon a percent of sales, and may pay initial fees. The results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees were not material to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale.

Leasing Arrangements At December 31, 2009, the Company was the lessee at 13,858 restaurant locations through ground leases (the Company leases the land and the Company or franchisee owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases land and buildings). Lease terms for most restaurants are generally for 20 years and, in many cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options, with certain leases providing purchase options. Escalation terms vary by geographic segment with examples including fixed-rent escalations, escalations based on an inflation index, and fair-value market adjustments. The timing of these escalations generally ranges from annually to every five years. For most locations, the Company is obligated for the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance; however, for franchised sites, the Company requires the franchisees to pay these costs. In addition, the Company is the lessee under noncancelable leases covering certain offices and vehicles. Future minimum payments required under existing operating leases with initial terms of one year or more are: ##TABLE_START In millions  Restaurant  Other  Total 2010  $ 1,064.7  $ 54.7  $ 1,119.4 2011   1,002.4   44.1   1,046.5 2012   928.1   35.3   963.4 2013   859.8   25.6   885.4 2014   783.9   22.0   805.9 Thereafter   5,794.5   102.4   5,896.9 Total minimum payments  $ 10,433.4  $ 284.1  $ 10,717.5 ##TABLE_END The following table provides detail of rent expense: ##TABLE_START In millions  2009  2008  2007 Company-operated restaurants:    U.S.  $ 65.2  $ 73.7  $ 82.0 Outside the U.S.   506.9   532.0   533.9 Total   572.1   605.7   615.9 Franchised restaurants:    U.S.   393.9   374.7   358.4 Outside the U.S.   431.4   409.4   364.5 Total   825.3   784.1   722.9 Other   98.9   101.8   98.5 Total rent expense  $ 1,496.3  $ 1,491.6  $ 1,437.3 ##TABLE_END Rent expense included percent rents in excess of minimum rents (in millions) as followsCompany-operated restaurants: 2009$129.6; 2008$130.2; 2007$118.3.

After considering the deferred tax accounting impact, it is expected that about $330 million of the total as of December 31, 2009 would favorably affect the effective tax rate if resolved in the Companys favor. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START In millions  2009   2008  Balance at January 1  $ 272.5   $ 249.7  Decreases for positions taken in prior years   (16.4 )   (21.8 ) Increases for positions taken in prior years   21.8    25.0  Increases for positions related to the current year   Increases with deferred tax offset   83.9    7.7  Other increases   178.0    58.2  Settlements with taxing authorities   (20.8 )   (39.5 ) Lapsing of statutes of limitations   (27.0 )   (6.8 ) Balance at December 31 (1)(2)  $ 492.0   $ 272.5  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) This balance is before consideration of the deferred tax accounting offsets. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Of the 2009 balance, $285.6 million is included in other long-term liabilities and $206.4 million is included in deferred income taxes on the Consolidated balance sheet. The 2008 balance is included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheet. ##TABLE_END It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next 12 months by $40 million to $90 million. This decrease would result from the expiration of the statute of limitations and the completion of tax audits in multiple tax jurisdictions. The Company is generally no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2003. The continuing practice of the Company is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in the provision for income taxes. The Company had $18.7 million and $24.1 million accrued for interest at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and no accrual for penalties in either year. The Company recorded interest expense related to tax matters of $1.5 million in 2009 and $13.7 million in 2008 and interest income related to tax matters of $34.9 million in 2007, and no expense for penalties in any of the three years. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. These temporary differences were approximately $9.2 billion at December 31, 2009 and consisted primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. Determination of the deferred income tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.  Segment and Geographic Information The Company operates in the food service industry and manages its business as distinct geographic segments. All intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in computing revenues and operating income. Corporate general  administrative expenses are included in Other Countries  Corporate and consist of home office support costs in areas such as facilities, finance, human resources, information technology, legal, marketing, restaurant operations, supply chain and training. Corporate assets include corporate cash and equivalents, asset portions of financial instruments and home office facilities. ##TABLE_START In millions  2009   2008   2007  U.S.  $ 7,943.8   $ 8,078.3   $ 7,905.5  Europe   9,273.8    9,922.9    8,926.2  APMEA   4,337.0    4,230.8    3,598.9  Other Countries  Corporate   1,190.1    1,290.4    2,356.0  Total revenues  $ 22,744.7   $ 23,522.4   $ 22,786.6  U.S.  $ 3,231.7   $ 3,059.7   $ 2,841.9  Europe   2,588.1    2,608.0    2,125.4  APMEA   989.5    818.8    616.3  Other Countries  Corporate   31.7 (1)    (43.6 )   (1,704.6 ) (2)  Total operating income  $ 6,841.0   $ 6,442.9   $ 3,879.0  U.S.  $ 10,429.3   $ 10,356.7   $ 10,031.8  Europe   11,494.4    10,532.7    11,380.4  APMEA   4,409.0    4,074.6    4,145.3  Other Countries  Corporate   3,892.2    3,497.5    3,834.2  Total assets  $ 30,224.9   $ 28,461.5   $ 29,391.7  U.S.  $ 659.4   $ 837.4   $ 805.1  Europe   859.3    864.1    687.4  APMEA   354.6    360.6    302.8  Other Countries  Corporate   78.8    73.6    97.3  Businesses held for sale     43.7  Discontinued operations           10.3  Total capital expenditures  $ 1,952.1   $ 2,135.7   $ 1,946.6  U.S.  $ 423.8   $ 400.9   $ 402.7  Europe   483.2    506.3    473.3  APMEA   202.9    193.4    178.1  Other Countries  Corporate   106.3    107.2    112.6  Businesses held for sale     26.1  Discontinued operations           21.3  Total depreciation and amortization  $ 1,216.2   $ 1,207.8   $ 1,214.1  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Includes $65.2 million of pretax income recorded in Impairment and other charges (credits), net related primarily to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latam transaction. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Includes $1.7 billion of pretax impairment charges related to the Companys sale of its Latam businesses to a developmental licensee organization. ##TABLE_END  Total long-lived assets, primarily property and equipment, were (in millions)  Consolidated: 2009$25,896.1; 2008$24,385.8; 2007$25,186.9. U.S. based: 2009$10,376.4; 2008$10,389.7; 2007$10,043.7. Debt Financing LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS At December 31, 2009, the Company had a $1.3 billion line of credit agreement expiring in 2012 with fees of 0.05% per annum on the total commitment, which remained unused. Fees and interest rates on this line are based on the Companys long-term credit rating assigned by Moodys and Standard  Poors. In addition, certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. had unused lines of credit totaling $913.4 million at December 31, 2009; these uncommitted lines of credit were principally short-term and denominated in various currencies at local market rates of interest. The weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings was 4.1% at December 31, 2009 (based on $598.7 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings) and 4.7% at December 31, 2008 (based on $232.1 million of commercial paper and $625.4 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings). FAIR VALUES At December 31, 2009, the fair value of the Companys debt obligations was estimated at $11.3 billion, compared to a carrying amount of $10.6 billion. This fair value was estimated using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated quoted market prices and are similar to Level 2 inputs within the valuation hierarchy as defined in the fair value guidance. The Company has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt prior to maturity. DEBT OBLIGATIONS The Company has incurred debt obligations principally through public and private offerings and bank loans. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions, and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. Under certain agreements, the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at par or at a premium over par.  The following table summarizes the Companys debt obligations. (Interest rates and debt amounts reflected in the table include the effects of interest rate exchange agreements.) ##TABLE_START       Interest rates (1) December 31      Amounts outstanding December 31 In millions of U.S. Dollars  Maturity dates  2009   2008      2009  2008 Fixed   5.6 %  5.6 %   $ 4,677.6  $ 4,726.1 Floating    2.9   2.3      1,300.0   857.1 Total U.S. Dollars  2010-2039           5,977.6   5,583.2 Fixed   4.8   5.0     932.6   704.1 Floating    1.8   5.2      683.9   829.4 Total Euro  2010-2016           1,616.5   1,533.5 Fixed   6.0   6.0     726.2   654.9 Floating       3.6         2.0 Total British Pounds Sterling  2020-2032           726.2   656.9 Fixed   2.0   2.2     488.6   720.1 Floating    1.0   1.6      537.0   440.2 Total Japanese Yen  2010-2030           1,025.6   1,160.3 Fixed   2.7   2.8     359.6   453.8 Floating    3.8   5.6      793.3   722.5 Total other currencies (2)  2010-2021           1,152.9   1,176.3 Debt obligations before fair value adjustments (3)             10,498.8   10,110.2 Fair value adjustments (4)             79.6   107.6 Total debt obligations (5)            $ 10,578.4  $ 10,217.8 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Weighted-average effective rate, computed on a semi-annual basis. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Primarily consists of Swiss Francs, Chinese Renminbi, South Korean Won, and Singapore Dollars. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Aggregate maturities for 2009 debt balances, before fair value adjustments, were as follows (in millions): 2010$18.1; 2011$613.2; 2012$2,188.4; 2013$657.7; 2014$459.4; Thereafter$6,562.0. These amounts include a reclassification of short-term obligations totaling $1.2 billion to long-term obligations as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in 2012. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4) The Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC requires that the carrying value of underlying items in fair value hedges, in this case debt obligations, be adjusted for fair value changes to the extent they are attributable to the risk designated as being hedged. The related hedging instrument is also recorded at fair value in prepaid expenses and other current assets, miscellaneous other assets or other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheet. A portion ($14.4 million) of the adjustments at December 31, 2009 related to interest rate exchange agreements that were terminated in December 2002 and will amortize as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (5) Includes notes payable, current maturities of long-term debt and long-term debt included on the Consolidated balance sheet. The increase in debt obligations from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 was due to (in millions): net issuances ($219.3), changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt ($128.3) and other changes related primarily to the consolidation of Norway ($41.0), partly offset by noncash fair value hedging adjustments ($28.0). ##TABLE_END ESOP LOANS Borrowings related to the leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) at December 31, 2009, which include $55.7 million of loans from the Company to the ESOP, are reflected as debt with a corresponding reduction of shareholders equity (additional paid-in capital included a balance of $48.4 million and $56.4 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively). The ESOP is repaying the loans and interest through 2018 using Company contributions and dividends from its McDonalds common stock holdings. As the principal amount of the borrowings is repaid, the debt and the unearned ESOP compensation (additional paid-in capital) are reduced. Employee Benefit Plans The Companys Profit Sharing and Savings Plan for U.S.-based employees includes a 401(k) feature, an ESOP feature, and a discretionary employer profit sharing match. The 401(k) feature allows participants to make pretax contributions that are partly matched from shares released under the ESOP. The Profit Sharing and Savings Plan also provides for a discretionary employer profit sharing match after the end of the year for those participants eligible to share in the match who have contributed to the 401(k) feature. All current account balances and future contributions and related earnings can be invested in several investment alternatives as well as McDonalds common stock in accordance with each participants elections. Participants future contributions to the 401(k) feature and the discretionary employer matching contribution feature are limited to 20% investment in McDonalds common stock. Participants may choose to make separate investment choices for current account balances and for future contributions. The Company also maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan because of Internal Revenue Service limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities were $397.3 million at December 31, 2009 and $389.7 million at December 31, 2008 and were primarily included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheet.  The Company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of the liabilities. At December 31, 2009, derivatives with a fair value of $79.6 million indexed to the Companys stock as well as an investment totaling $74.5 million indexed to certain market indices were included in miscellaneous other assets on the Consolidated balance sheet. All changes in liabilities for these nonqualified plans and in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in selling, general  administrative expenses. Changes in fair value of the derivatives indexed to the Companys stock are recorded in income because the contracts provide the counterparty with a choice to settle in cash or shares. Total U.S. costs for the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan, including nonqualified benefits and related hedging activities, were (in millions): 2009$51.3; 2008$61.2; 2007$57.6. Certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. also offer profit sharing, stock purchase or other similar benefit plans. Total plan costs outside the U.S. were (in millions): 2009$45.2; 2008$55.4; 2007$62.7. The total combined liabilities for international retirement plans were $183.7 million and $131.1 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, primarily in the U.K. and Canada. Other postretirement benefits and postemployment benefits were immaterial. Share-based Compensation The Company maintains a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plans was 85.9 million at December 31, 2009, including 35.3 million available for future grants. STOCK OPTIONS Stock options to purchase common stock are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Companys stock on the date of grant. Substantially all of the options become exercisable in four equal installments, beginning a year from the date of the grant, and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. Options granted between May 1, 1999 and December 31, 2000 (approximately 10 million options outstanding at December 31, 2009) expire 13 years from the date of grant. Intrinsic value for stock options is defined as the difference between the current market value and the exercise price. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $302.5 million, $549.5 million and $815.3 million, respectively. Cash received from stock options exercised during 2009 was $332.1 million and the actual tax benefit realized for tax deductions from stock options exercised totaled $86.0 million. The Company uses treasury shares purchased under the Companys share repurchase program to satisfy share-based exercises. A summary of the status of the Companys stock option grants as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, and changes during the years then ended, is presented in the following table: ##TABLE_START    2009     2008         2007 Options  Shares in millions   Weighted- average exercise price  Weighted- average remaining contractual life in years  Aggregate intrinsic value in millions     Shares in millions   Weighted- average exercise price     Shares in millions   Weighted- average exercise price Outstanding at beginning of year  53.4   $ 34.88     67.5   $ 31.85   101.9   $ 30.03 Granted  5.6    56.94     5.3    56.55   5.7    45.02 Exercised  (10.7 )   31.17     (18.7 )   29.97   (38.4 )   28.89 Forfeited/expired  (0.5 )   47.22        (0.7 )   37.53   (1.7 )   33.63 Outstanding at end of year  47.8   $ 38.16  5.06  $ 1,161.1   53.4   $ 34.88   67.5   $ 31.85 Exercisable at end of year  35.4   $ 33.06  3.96  $ 1,038.8   40.8       52.6     ##TABLE_END RSUs RSUs generally vest 100% on the third anniversary of the grant and are payable in either shares of McDonalds common stock or cash, at the Companys discretion.

The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: ##TABLE_START  I. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  II. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  III. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ##TABLE_END There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may vary over time. Management assessed the design and effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework. Based on managements assessment using those criteria, as of December 31, 2009, management believes that the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. Ernst  Young, LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. Their reports are presented on the following pages. The independent registered public accountants and internal auditors advise management of the results of their audits, and make recommendations to improve the system of internal controls. Management evaluates the audit recommendations and takes appropriate action. McDONALDS CORPORATION February 26, 2010  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonalds Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McDonalds Corporation as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of McDonalds Corporation at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As discussed in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2007, the Company changed its method of accounting for uncertain tax positions and for compensation costs associated with a sabbatical to conform with new accounting guidance. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), McDonalds Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. ERNST  YOUNG LLP Chicago, Illinois February 26, 2010  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonalds Corporation We have audited McDonalds Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). McDonalds Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report on Managements Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, McDonalds Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of McDonalds Corporation as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, and our report dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Controls and Procedures DISCLOSURE CONTROLS An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2009.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Companys management, including the CEO and CFO, confirm that there was no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

Business McDonalds Corporation, the registrant, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to herein as the Company. a. General development of business During 2010, there have been no material changes to the Companys corporate structure or in its method of conducting business. In 2010, the Company has continued the process it began in 2005 to realign certain subsidiaries to develop a corporate structure within its geographic segments that better reflects the operation of the McDonalds worldwide business. b. Financial information about segments Segment data for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 are included in Part II, Item 8, page 40 of this Form 10-K. c. Narrative description of business ##TABLE_START   General ##TABLE_END The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants in the global restaurant industry. These restaurants serve a varied, yet limited, value-priced menu (see Products) in more than 100 countries around the world. All restaurants are operated either by the Company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchise arrangements, and foreign affiliated markets and developmental licensees under license agreements. The Companys operations are designed to assure consistency and high quality at every restaurant. When granting franchises or licenses, the Company is selective and generally is not in the practice of franchising to passive investors. Under the conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and dcor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. A discussion regarding site selection is included in Part I, Item 2, page 6 of this Form 10-K. Conventional franchisees contribute to the Companys revenue stream through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees received upon the opening of a new restaurant or the granting of a new franchise term. The conventional franchise arrangement typically lasts 20 years, and franchising practices are generally consistent throughout the world. Over 70% of franchised restaurants operate under conventional franchise arrangements. The Company has an equity investment in a limited number of foreign affiliated markets, referred to as affiliates. The largest of these affiliates is Japan, where there are more than 3,300 restaurants. The Company receives a royalty based on a percent of sales in these markets. Under a developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest. While the Company has no capital invested, it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales, as well as initial fees. The largest of these developmental license arrangements operates more than 1,750 restaurants across 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Company and its franchisees purchase food, packaging, equipment and other goods from numerous independent suppliers. The Company has established and strictly enforces high quality standards and product specifications. The Company has quality assurance labs around the world to ensure that its high standards are consistently met. The quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews, but also on-site inspections of suppliers facilities. A quality assurance board, composed of the Companys technical, safety and supply chain specialists, provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food quality and safety. In addition, the Company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation, assure best practices and drive continuous improvement. Leveraging scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies, the Company also collaborates with suppliers toward a goal of achieving competitive, predictable food and paper costs over the long term. Independently owned and operated distribution centers, approved by the Company, distribute products and supplies to most McDonalds restaurants. In addition, restaurant personnel are trained in the proper storage, handling and preparation of products and in the delivery of customer service. McDonalds global brand is well known. Marketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed to promote McDonalds brand image and differentiate the Company from competitors. Marketing and promotional efforts focus on value, food taste, menu choice and the customer experience. The Company continuously endeavors to improve its social responsibility and environmental practices to achieve long-term sustainability, which benefits McDonalds and the communities it serves. The Company has disposed of non-McDonalds restaurant businesses to concentrate resources on its core business. In February 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox Automated Retail, LLC, and in April 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K.-based Pret A Manger. ##TABLE_START   Products ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu, although there are geographic variations to suit local consumer preferences and tastes. In addition, McDonalds tests new products on an ongoing basis. McDonalds menu includes hamburgers and cheeseburgers, Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Filet-O-Fish, several chicken sandwiches, Chicken McNuggets, Chicken Selects, Snack Wraps, french fries, salads, shakes, McFlurry desserts, sundaes, soft serve cones, pies, cookies, soft drinks, coffee, McCaf beverages and other beverages. In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of other products during limited-time promotions. McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. and many international markets offer a full or limited breakfast menu. Breakfast offerings may include Egg McMuffin, Sausage McMuffin with Egg, McGriddles, biscuit and bagel sandwiches and hotcakes.  ##TABLE_START   Intellectual property ##TABLE_END The Company owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information. The Company considers the trademarks McDonalds and The Golden Arches Logo to be of material importance to its business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. Patents, copyrights and licenses are of varying remaining durations. ##TABLE_START   Seasonal operations ##TABLE_END The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree. ##TABLE_START   Working capital practices ##TABLE_END Information about the Companys working capital practices is incorporated herein by reference to Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 in Part II, Item 7, pages 10 through 27, and the Consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 in Part II, Item 8, page 30 of this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START   Customers ##TABLE_END The Companys business is not dependent upon either a single customer or small group of customers. ##TABLE_START   Backlog ##TABLE_END Company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders. ##TABLE_START   Government contracts ##TABLE_END No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government. ##TABLE_START   Competition ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of food products. The Company competes on the basis of price, convenience, service, menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry. In measuring the Companys competitive position, management reviews data compiled by Euromonitor International, a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry. The Companys primary competition, which management refers to as the Informal Eating Out (IEO) segment, includes the following restaurant categories defined by Euromonitor International: quick-service eating establishments, casual dining full-service restaurants, 100% home delivery/takeaway providers, street stalls or kiosks, specialist coffee shops and self-service cafeterias. The IEO segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and full-service restaurants other than casual dining. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the global IEO segment was composed of approximately 6.3 million outlets and generated $868 billion in annual sales in 2009, the most recent year for which data is available. McDonalds Systemwide 2009 restaurant business accounted for approximately 0.5% of those outlets and about 8% of the sales. Management also on occasion benchmarks McDonalds against the entire restaurant industry, including the IEO segment defined above and all other full-service restaurants. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 13.1 million outlets and generated about $1.79 trillion in annual sales in 2009. McDonalds Systemwide restaurant business accounted for approximately 0.2% of those outlets and about 4% of the sales. ##TABLE_START   Research and development ##TABLE_END The Company operates research and development facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. While research and development activities are important to the Companys business, these expenditures are not material. Independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System). ##TABLE_START   Environmental matters ##TABLE_END Increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives, particularly in the area of climate change. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. Although the impact would likely vary by world region and/or market, we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs, including for the Company, its franchisees and suppliers. Also, there is a possibility that governmental initiatives, or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns or climate, could have a direct impact on the operations of our restaurants or the operations of our suppliers in ways which we cannot predict at this time. The Company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner. At this time, the Company has already undertaken its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment, including the development of means of monitoring and reducing energy use, in many of its markets. ##TABLE_START   Number of employees ##TABLE_END The Companys number of employees worldwide, including Company-operated restaurant employees, was approximately 400,000 as of year-end 2010. d.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook for 2011. These statements use such words as may, will, expect, believe and plan. They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements. Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. The most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment. The IEO segment of the restaurant industry, although largely mature in our major markets, is highly fragmented and competitive. The current economic environment has caused the IEO segment to contract in many markets, including some of our major markets, and this may continue. The current environment, including persistently high unemployment rates in many of our markets, has also increased consumer focus on value and heightened pricing pressures across the industry. Combined with increasing pressure on commodity and labor costs, these circumstances could affect our ability to continue to grow comparable sales and margins despite the strength of our brand and value proposition. We have the added challenge of the cultural, economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate. Our operations, plans and results are also affected by regulatory and similar initiatives around the world, as well as by the focus on nutritional content and the production, processing and preparation of food from field to front counter. The risks we face can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance. Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we execute the Plan to Win. The Plan to Win addresses the key drivers of our business and resultspeople, products, place, price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following: ##TABLE_START   Our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to trends or other factors that affect the IEO segment and our competitive position in the diverse markets we serve, such as spending patterns, demographic changes, trends in food preparation, consumer preferences and publicity about us, all of which can drive popular perceptions of our business or affect the willingness of other companies to enter into site, supply or other arrangements or alliances with us; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our ability to drive restaurant improvements and to motivate our restaurant personnel to achieve sustained high service levels so as to improve consumer perceptions of our ability to meet expectations for quality food served in clean and friendly environments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Whether our restaurant reimaging and rebuilding efforts, which remain a priority notwithstanding the current challenging economic and operating environment, are targeted at the elements of the restaurant experience that will best accomplish our goals to enhance the relevance of our brand and achieve an efficient allocation of our capital resources; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The risks associated with our franchise business model, including whether our franchisees and developmental licensees will have the experience and financial resources to be effective operators and remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and capital-intensive initiatives and the potential impact on us if they experience food safety or other operational problems or project a brand image inconsistent with our values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited by local law or otherwise, costly to exercise or subject to litigation; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The success of our initiatives to support menu choice, physical activity and nutritional awareness and to address these and other matters of social responsibility in a way that communicates our values effectively and inspires trust and confidence; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our ability to respond effectively to adverse perceptions about the quick-service category of the IEO segment or about our products, promotions and premiums, such as Happy Meals (collectively, our products), or the reliability of our supply chain and the safety of our products, and our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonalds of food-borne illnesses or product safety issues; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The success of our plans to improve existing menu items and to roll out new menu items, as well as the impact of our competitors actions, including in response to our menu changes and product introductions, and our ability to continue robust menu development and manage the complexity of our restaurant operations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our ability to differentiate the McDonalds experience in a way that balances consumer value with margin expansion, particularly in markets where pricing or cost pressures are significant or have been exacerbated by the current challenging economic and operating environment; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of pricing, marketing and promotional plans on sales and margins and our ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly to changing economic conditions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of events such as boycotts or protests, labor strikes and supply chain interruptions (including due to lack of supply or price increases) that can adversely affect us directly or adversely affect the vendors, franchisees and others that are also part of the McDonalds System and whose performance has a material impact on our results; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our ability to recruit and retain qualified local personnel to manage our operations and growth in certain developing markets; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our ability to leverage promotional or operating successes in individual markets into other markets in a timely and cost-effective way; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The costs and operational risks associated with our increasing reliance on information technology (including our point-of-sale and other in-store technology systems or platforms), such as the need for increasing investments to upgrade and maintain our systems, the potential for system failures or programming errors and the impact on our margins as the use of cashless payments becomes more widespread. ##TABLE_END Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, which can adversely affect our sales, margins and net income. Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions, but also by local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market or daypart (e.g., breakfast). To mitigate the impact of these conditions, we may take promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins, limit our operating flexibility or result in charges, restaurant closings or sales of Company-operated restaurants. Some macroeconomic conditions could have an even more wide-ranging and prolonged impact. The current environment has been characterized by weak economies, persistently high unemployment rates and continuing uncertainty in financial and credit markets. These conditions have significantly affected consumer confidence and spending. Moreover, the strength of the current recovery is uncertain in many of our most important markets, and growth in consumer spending generally lags improvement in the broader economy. The key factors that can affect our operations, plans and results in this environment are the following: ##TABLE_START   Whether our strategies will permit us to compete effectively and make continued market share gains despite the uncertain economic outlook, while at the same time achieving sales and operating income within our targeted long-term average annual range of growth; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The effectiveness of our supply chain management, including hedging strategies, to assure reliable and sufficient product supply on favorable terms; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   The impact of foreign exchange and interest rates, as well as governmental actions to manage national economic matters, including austerity initiatives, credit availability, unemployment and taxation rates, all of which can also affect relative levels of disposable income and discretionary expenditures, such as food away from home; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor-intensive business model, the long-term trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets and any potential impact of union organizing efforts; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Whether we are able to identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants from year to year, and whether new sites are as profitable as expected; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets, such as China and Russia, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest, all of which are exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment charges that reduce our earnings. ##TABLE_END Increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following: ##TABLE_START   The cost, compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face, especially in the United States where inconsistent standards imposed by local, state and federal authorities can adversely affect popular perceptions of our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings, and the impact of new, potential or changing regulation that affects or restricts elements of our business, particularly those relating to marketing to children, nutritional content and product labeling and safety; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of nutritional, health and other scientific inquiries and conclusions, which constantly evolve and often have contradictory implications, but nonetheless drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation, including taxation, in ways that could be material to our business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The risks and costs of McDonalds nutritional labeling and other disclosure practices, particularly given differences among applicable legal requirements and practices within the restaurant industry with respect to testing and disclosure, ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants, and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information obtained from third party suppliers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities and non-governmental organizations on environmental matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption, including as a result of initiatives that effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of litigation trends, particularly in our major markets, including class actions, labor and employment claims and landlord/tenant disputes; the relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings; and the cost and other effects of settlements or judgments, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The increasing costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and overseas regulations affecting our workforce and labor practices, including regulations relating to wage and hour practices, immigration, mandatory healthcare benefits and unlawful workplace discrimination; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of the current economic conditions on unemployment levels and consumer confidence and the effect of initiatives to stimulate economic recovery and to further regulate financial markets on the cost and availability of funding for the Company and its franchisees, inflation and foreign exchange rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Disruptions in our operations or price volatility in a market that can result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or import-export controls, increased tariffs or government-mandated closure of our or our vendors operations, and the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or proceedings, whether or not they have merit; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The legal and compliance risks associated with information technology, such as the costs of compliance with privacy, consumer protection and other laws, the potential costs associated with alleged security breaches (including the loss of consumer confidence that may result and the risk of criminal penalties or civil liability to consumers or employees whose data is alleged to have been collected or used inappropriately) and potential challenges to the associated intellectual property rights; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, changes in tax accounting or tax laws (or authoritative interpretations relating to any of these matters), and the impact of settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the IRS or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. ##TABLE_ENDThe trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors. Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these, some of which are outside our control, are the following: ##TABLE_START   The continuing uncertain global economic and market conditions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the United States which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Changes in financial or tax reporting and accounting principles or practices that materially affect our reported financial condition and results and investor perceptions of our performance; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can reflect market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete in some cases) or expectations about our business, our creditworthiness or investor confidence generally; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonalds may be included, such as the SP 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of our stock repurchase program, dividend rate or changes in our debt levels on our credit ratings, interest expense, ability to obtain funding on favorable terms or our operating or financial flexibility, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact on our results of other corporate actions, such as those we may take from time to time as part of our continuous review of our corporate structure in light of business, legal and tax considerations. ##TABLE_END Our results can be adversely affected by disruptions or events, such as the impact of severe weather conditions and natural disasters. Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics, or expectations about them, can have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels or on other factors that affect our results and prospects, such as commodity costs. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.  ", "2": " ITEM 2. Properties The Company owns and leases real estate primarily in connection with its restaurant business. The Company identifies and develops sites that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential to the Company. To assess potential, the Company analyzes traffic and walking patterns, census data and other relevant data. The Companys experience and access to advanced technology aid in evaluating this information. The Company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for restaurant sites, which ensures long-term occupancy rights and helps control related costs. Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to control average development costs through construction and design efficiencies, standardization and by leveraging the Companys global sourcing network. Additional information about the Companys properties is included in Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in Part II, Item 7, pages 10 through 27 and in Financial statements and supplementary data in Part II, Item 8, pages 27 through 44 of this Form 10-K. ", "3": " ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings The Company has pending a number of lawsuits that have been filed from time to time in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover a broad variety of allegations spanning the Companys entire business. The following is a brief description of the more significant types of lawsuits. In addition, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local regulations that impact various aspects of its business, as discussed below. While the Company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, unfavorable rulings could occur. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on net income for the period in which the ruling occurs or for future periods. ##TABLE_START   Franchising ##TABLE_END A substantial number of McDonalds restaurants are franchised to independent entrepreneurs operating under contractual arrangements with the Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company and its franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects including, but not limited to, quality, service and cleanliness issues, contentions regarding grants or terminations of franchises, delinquent payments of rents and fees, and franchisee claims for additional franchises or rewrites of franchises. Additionally, occasional disputes arise between the Company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a McDonalds franchise. ##TABLE_START   Suppliers ##TABLE_END The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries do not supply food, paper or related items to any McDonalds restaurants. The Company relies upon numerous independent suppliers that are required to meet and maintain the Companys high standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company and its suppliers which include, by way of example, compliance with product specifications and the Companys business relationship with suppliers. In addition, disputes occasionally arise on a number of issues between the Company and individuals or enti- ties who claim that they should be (or should have been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the Companys restaurants. ##TABLE_START   Employees ##TABLE_END Hundreds of thousands of people are employed by the Company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, thousands of people from time to time seek employment in such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes arise regarding hiring, firing, promotion and pay practices, including wage and hour disputes, alleged discrimination and compliance with employment laws. ##TABLE_START   Customers ##TABLE_END Restaurants owned by subsidiaries of the Company regularly serve a broad segment of the public. In so doing, disputes arise as to products, service, incidents, advertising, nutritional and other disclosures, as well as other matters common to an extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company. ##TABLE_START   Intellectual Property ##TABLE_END The Company has registered trademarks and service marks, patents and copyrights, some of which are of material importance to the Companys business. From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation to protect its intellectual property and defend against the alleged use of third party intellectual property. ##TABLE_START   Government Regulations ##TABLE_END Local, state and federal governments have adopted laws and regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business including, but not limited to, advertising, franchising, health, safety, environment, zoning and employment. The Company strives to comply with all applicable existing statutory and administrative rules and cannot predict the effect on its operations from the issuance of additional requirements in the future.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities The Companys common stock trades under the symbol MCD and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange in the U.S. The following table sets forth the common stock price ranges on the New York Stock Exchange and dividends declared per common share: ##TABLE_START    2010       2009  Dollars per share  High   Low   Dividend       High   Low   Dividend  Quarter:        First   67.49    61.06    0.55     64.46    50.44    0.50  Second   71.84    65.55    0.55     61.01    51.76    0.50  Third   76.26    65.31    1.16 *    59.59    53.88    1.05 * Fourth   80.94    74.40            64.75    56.03      Year   80.94    61.06    2.26        64.75    50.44    2.05  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START * Includes a $0.55 and $0.50 per share dividend declared and paid in third quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively, and a $0.61 and $0.55 per share dividend declared in third quarter and paid in fourth quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively. ##TABLE_ENDThe number of shareholders of record and beneficial owners of the Companys common stock as of January 31, 2011 was estimated to be 1,348,000. Given the Companys returns on equity, incremental invested capital and assets, management believes it is prudent to reinvest in the business in markets with acceptable returns and/or opportunity for long-term growth and use excess cash flow to return cash to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases or a combination of both. The Company has paid dividends on common stock for 35 consecutive years through 2010 and has increased the dividend amount at least once every year.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants. Of the 32,737 restaurants in 117 countries at year-end 2010, 26,338 were franchised or licensed (including 19,279 franchised to conventional franchisees, 3,485 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,574 licensed to foreign affiliates (affiliates)primarily Japan) and 6,399 were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and dcor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate and/or franchise restaurants within a market. We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. However, directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In our Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. We continually review, and as appropriate adjust, our mix of Company-operated and franchised (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and foreign affiliated) restaurants to help optimize overall performance. The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (U.S.), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA). In addition, throughout this report we present Other Countries  Corporate that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 34%, 40% and 21% of total revenues, respectively. The United Kingdom (U.K.), France and Germany, collectively, account for over 50% of Europes revenues; and China, Australia and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for over 50% of APMEAs revenues. These six markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise approximately 70% of total revenues. The Company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the McDonalds restaurant business as we believe significant opportunities remain for long-term growth. Accordingly, in 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox Automated Retail, LLC (Redbox) for total consideration of $140 million. In 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K.-based Pret A Manger for cash proceeds of $229 million. In connection with both sales, the Company recognized nonoperating gains. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth and returns. ##TABLE_START   Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because we believe this better represents the Companys underlying business trends. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Companys initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. McDonalds reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal. In 2008, there was an incremental full day of sales and guest counts due to leap year. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Companys financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the adjusted cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. ##TABLE_END STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System) has been key to McDonalds success. This business model enables McDonalds to deliver consistent, locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve. In addition, it facilitates our ability to identify, implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers changing needs and preferences. McDonalds customer-focused Plan to Winwhich concentrates on being better, not just biggerprovides a common framework for our global business yet allows for local adaptation. Through the execution of initiatives surrounding the five elements of our Plan to WinPeople, Products, Place, Price and Promotionwe have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown comparable sales and customer visits in each of the last seven years. This Plan, combined with financial discipline, has delivered strong results for our shareholders. We have exceeded our long-term, constant currency financial targets of average annual Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%; average annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%; and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the Plans implementation in 2003, after adjusting for the loss in 2007 from the Latin America developmental license transaction. Given the size and scope of our global business, we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable over time, keeping us focused on making the best decisions for the long-term benefit of our System. In 2010, we continued to enhance the customer experience by remaining focused on the Companys key global success factors of branded affordability, menu variety and beverage choice, convenience including daypart expansion, ongoing restaurant reinvestment and operations excellence. Initiatives around these factors successfully resonated with consumers driving increases in sales and customer visits despite challenging economies and a contracting Informal Eating Out (IEO) market in many countries. As a result, every area of the world contributed to 2010 global comparable sales and guest counts, which increased 5.0% and 4.9%, respectively. Growth in comparable sales is driven by the Systems ability to optimize guest count growth, product mix shifts and menu price changes. Pricing actions reflect local market conditions, with a view to preserving and improving margins, while continuing to drive guest counts and market share gains. In general, the goal is to achieve a balanced contribution of price and guest counts to comparable sales growth. In the U.S., we grew sales, guest counts, market share and restaurant cash flow, with comparable sales increasing for the 8th consecutive year, rising 3.8% in 2010. These positive results were achieved despite a declining IEO market. This performance was attributed to several factors including core menu items like Chicken McNuggets and burgers, everyday affordability and value options, such as the Breakfast Dollar Menu, additions to the McCaf beverage line, new snack offerings and limited time offerings such as the McRib sandwich. The national launch of McCaf frapps and real-fruit smoothies provided a meaningful extension to the McCaf line that was well-received by customers. Extending the snack wrap line with the Angus Snack Wraps allowed customers to enjoy popular McDonalds burgers in a smaller, more portable fashion. Complementing these menu offerings were our convenient locations, efficient drive-thru service and value-oriented local beverage promotions. We broadened our accessibility through greater 24 hour operations and offered customers free Wi-Fi in over 12,000 restaurants. Modernizing the customer experience remained a focus with the extension of our interior and exterior reimaging program to enhance the appearance and functionality of our restaurants. In Europe, comparable sales rose 4.4%, marking the 7th consecutive year of comparable sales increases. Major contributors were France, the U.K., Russia and Germany. This performance reflected Europes strategic priorities of upgrading the customer and employee experience, increasing local relevance, and building brand transparency. Initiatives surrounding these platforms included leveraging our tiered menu featuring everyday affordable prices, menu variety including limited-time offerings, new dessert options, and reimaging almost 1,000 restaurants. We expanded our coffee business and have nearly 1,300 McCaf locations, which in Europe generally represent a separate area inside the restaurant that serves specialty coffees, indulgent desserts and light snacks. The expansion of self-order kiosks in France, Germany and Spain and the roll out of the new drive-thru customer order display system in over 3,000 restaurants enhanced service. In addition, we increased our accessibility and convenience with extended hours. We built upon the momentum of portable menu offerings with the introduction of McWrapslarger sized beef and chicken wraps in Germany, and Ptit Plaisir offerings in France. Finally, we continued building customer trust in our brand through communications that emphasized the quality and origin of McDonalds food and our sustainable business initiatives. In APMEA, our momentum continued with nearly every country delivering positive comparable sales, led by Japan, Australia and China. Comparable sales rose 6.0% through strategies emphasizing value, core menu extensions, breakfast and convenience. Australia launched Family Dinner Boxes featuring popular menu items bundled together at a discounted price while China and Japan concentrated on affordability with Value Lunch platforms. New menu items such as a third Angus burger option in Australia and the extension of the Spicy Wings line in China were popular with consumers. Japan executed a successful U.S.-themed burger promotion and a Chicken Festival promotion featuring several products. Our dessert strategy is introducing consumers to the McDonalds brand with products such as McFlurries and dessert kiosks in China, where we have become one of the largest retailers of ice cream. Our breakfast business continues to develop and is now offered in approximately 75% of APMEA restaurants. In Japan, value breakfast items, including the Sausage McMuffin and McGriddle, were rotated across several months, while Australia launched new breakfast menu items.  Nearly two-thirds of APMEA restaurants are now offering some form of extended hours and over 4,800 restaurants are open 24 hours. Delivery is offered in many APMEA markets and is now in approximately 1,600 restaurants, including nearly 400 in China. We continue to offer value to our customers by utilizing a strategic menu pricing tool that optimizes price, product mix, and promotions. This approach is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and effectively managing restaurant-level food and paper costs by leveraging our scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management practices. Our ability to execute our strategies successfully in every area of the world, grow comparable sales, leverage a low commodity cost environment and control selling, general  administrative expenses resulted in consolidated combined operating margin (operating income as a percent of total revenues) of 31.0% in 2010, an improvement of 0.9 percentage points over 2009. In 2010, strong global sales and margin performance grew cash from operations, which rose $591 million to $6.3 billion. Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us significant flexibility to fund capital expenditures and debt repayments as well as return cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures of approximately $2.1 billion were invested in our business primarily to open and reimage restaurants. Across the System, nearly 1,000 restaurants were opened and nearly 1,800 existing locations were reimaged. We returned $5.1 billion to shareholders consisting of $2.4 billion in dividends and nearly $2.7 billion in share repurchases. Cash from operations continues to benefit from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owner/operators provides a very stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs. In addition, the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the Company-owned model. We believe locally-owned and operated restaurants maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantage, making McDonalds not just a global brand, but also a locally relevant one. HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE YEAR INCLUDED: ##TABLE_START   Comparable sales grew 5.0% and guest counts rose 4.9%, building on 2009 increases of 3.8% and 1.4%, respectively. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Revenues increased 6% (5% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Company-operated margins improved to 19.6% and franchised margins improved to 82.4%. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Operating income increased 9% (9% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Earnings per share was $4.58 , an increase of 11%. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Cash provided by operations increased $591 million to $6.3 billion. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 11% to $0.61 for the fourth quarterbringing our current annual dividend rate to $2.44 per share. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   One-year ROIIC was 37.3% and three-year ROIIC was 38.3% for the period ended December 31, 2010 (see reconciliation on Page 25). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The Company returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends paid. ##TABLE_END OUTLOOK FOR 2011 We will continue to drive success in 2011 and beyond by enhancing customer relevance across all elements of our Plan to Win People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion. Our global System continues to be energized by our ongoing momentum and significant growth opportunities. We continue to hold a strong competitive position in the market place, and we intend to further differentiate our brand by striving to become our customers favorite place and way to eat and drink. We will continue growing market share by executing our key strategies in the following areas: optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening our accessibility. These efforts will include increasing menu choice, expanding destination beverages and desserts, enhancing our food image, accelerating our interior and exterior reimaging efforts and increasing the level and variety of conveniences provided to our customers. We will execute these priorities to increase McDonalds brand relevance while continuing to practice operational and financial discipline. Consequently, we are confident we can again meet or exceed our long-term constant currency financial targets. In the U.S., our 2011 focus will include highlighting core menu classics such as the Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese and Chicken McNuggets, emphasizing the convenient and affordable food offered every day, and encouraging the trial of new products including Fruit  Maple Oatmeal and additional McCaf beverage offerings. We will continue offering value across the menu through the Dollar Menu at breakfast and the rest of the day. Opportunities around additional staffing at peak hours and increasing restaurants that operate 24 hours per day will broaden accessibility to our customers. In addition, our plans to elevate the brand experience encompass updating our technology infrastructure with a new point-of-sale (POS) system, enhancing restaurant manager and crew retention and productivity, and contemporizing the interiors and exteriors of approximately 600 restaurants through reimaging. Our business in Europe will continue to be guided by three strategic priorities: increasing local relevance, upgrading the customer and employee experience, and building brand transparency. We will increase our local relevance by complementing our tiered menu with a variety of limited-time food events as well as new snack and dessert options. In 2011, we will reimage approximately 850 restaurants as we progress towards our goal of having 90% of our interiors and over 50% of our exteriors reimaged by the end of 2012. Reimaging reinforces the quality of our brand while further differentiating us from the competition. We will leverage service innovations with the deployment of technologies such as the new POS system, self-order kiosks, hand-held order devices and drive-thru customer order displays to enhance the customer experience and help drive increased transactions and labor efficiency. We believe there is an opportunity to further build brand transparency by raising customer awareness about our food quality and product sourcing. In addition, we will communicate our efforts to preserve the environment through our sustainable business initiatives. Our European business in 2011 faces some headwinds from government-initiated austerity measures being implemented in many countries. While we will closely monitor consumer reactions to these measures, we remain confident that our business model will continue to drive profitable growth. In APMEA, we will continue our efforts to become our customers first choice for eating out by focusing on menu variety, value, restaurant experience and convenience. The markets will continue to execute against a combination of core menu  items, food events and limited-time offerings to present a balanced mix of products to our customers. Value will continue to be a key growth driver as we reinforce the affordability of our menu to consumers and build on our successful Value Lunch platforms. We will invest in our business primarily by opening over 600 new restaurants and reimaging over 500 existing restaurants while elevating our focus on service and operations to drive efficiencies. In China, we will continue to build a foundation for long-term growth by increasing our base of restaurants by approximately 15% in 2011 toward our goal of nearly 2,000 restaurants by the end of 2013. Convenience initiatives include expanding delivery service across the region and building on the success of our extended operating hours. McDonalds has an ongoing commitment to optimize our restaurant ownership structure. A heavily franchised, less capital-intensive business model has favorable implications for the strength and stability of our cash flow, the amount of capital we invest and long-term returns. We continue to maintain a strong culture of financial discipline by effectively managing all spending in order to maximize business performance. In making capital allocation decisions, our goal is to elevate the McDonalds experience by driving sustainable growth in sales and market share while earning strong returns. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) to shareholders over the long term via dividends and share repurchases. McDonalds does not provide specific guidance on diluted earnings per share. The following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Companys results: ##TABLE_START   Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1.5 percentage points to 2011 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 541 net traditional restaurants added in 2010. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would increase annual diluted earnings per share by about 3 cents. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   With about 75% of McDonalds grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Companys commodity costs. For the full year 2011, the total basket of goods cost is expected to increase 2-2.5% in the U.S. and to increase 3.5-4.5% in Europe as compared to 2010. Some volatility may be experienced between quarters in the normal course of business. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The Company expects full-year 2011 selling, general  administrative expenses to decrease 2-3%, in constant currencies, partly due to higher incentive compensation in 2010 based on performance. In addition, fluctuations will be experienced between quarters due to certain items in 2010, such as the Vancouver Winter Olympics in February and the biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention in April. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2011 to increase approximately 7% compared with 2010. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   A significant part of the Companys operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, Australian Dollar, British Pound and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 65% of the Companys operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Companys annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 20 cents. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year 2011 to be approximately 30% to 32%. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The Company expects capital expenditures for 2011 to be approximately $2.5 billion. About half of this amount will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open about 1,100 restaurants including about 400 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets, such as Japan and Latin America, where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of about 750 traditional restaurants. The remaining capital will be used for reinvestment in existing restaurants. Over half of this reinvestment will be used to reimage approximately 2,200 locations worldwide, some of which will require no capital investment from the Company. ##TABLE_END Consolidated Operating Results Operating results ##TABLE_START   2010      2009      2008  Dollars in millions, except per share data  Amount   Increase/ (decrease)       Amount   Increase/ (decrease)       Amount  Revenues        Sales by Company-operated restaurants  $ 16,233    5 %   $ 15,459    (7 )%   $ 16,561  Revenues from franchised restaurants   7,842    8        7,286    5        6,961  Total revenues   24,075    6        22,745    (3 )       23,522  Operating costs and expenses        Company-operated restaurant expenses   13,060    3     12,651    (7 )    13,653  Franchised restaurantsoccupancy expenses   1,378    6     1,302    6     1,230  Selling, general  administrative expenses   2,333    4     2,234    (5 )    2,355  Impairment and other charges (credits), net   29    nm     (61 )   nm     6  Other operating (income) expense, net   (198 )   11        (222 )   (35 )       (165 ) Total operating costs and expenses   16,602    4        15,904    (7 )       17,079  Operating income   7,473    9     6,841    6     6,443  Interest expense   451    (5 )    473    (9 )    523  Nonoperating (income) expense, net   22    nm     (24 )   69     (78 ) Gain on sale of investment       nm        (95 )   41        (160 ) Income before provision for income taxes   7,000    8        6,487    5        6,158  Provision for income taxes   2,054    6        1,936    5        1,845  Net income  $ 4,946    9 %      $ 4,551    6 %      $ 4,313  Earnings per common sharediluted  $ 4.58    11 %      $ 4.11    9 %      $ 3.76  Weighted-average common shares outstandingdiluted   1,080.3            1,107.4            1,146.0  ##TABLE_END nm Not meaningful. IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonalds mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2010, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by stronger global curren- cies, primarily the Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, partly offset by the weaker Euro. In 2009, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results, primarily driven by the Euro, British Pound, Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. In 2008, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results, driven by the stronger Euro and most other currencies, partly offset by the weaker British Pound.

Results for the year included after tax charges due to Impairment and other charges (credits), net of $25 million or $0.02 per share, primarily related to the Companys share of restaurant closing costs in McDonalds Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate) in conjunction with the first quarter strategic review of the markets restaurant portfolio, partly offset by income related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $0.01 per share on diluted earnings per share for the year. In 2009, net income and diluted earnings per common share were $4.6 billion and $4.11. Results benefited by after tax income due to Impairment and other charges (credits), net of $91 million or $0.08 per share, primarily due to the resolution of  certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. Results also benefited by an after tax gain of $59 million or $0.05 per share due to the sale of the Companys minority ownership interest in Redbox, reflected in Gain on sale of investment. Results were negatively impacted by $0.15 per share due to the effect of foreign currency translation.  In 2008, net income and diluted earnings per common share were $4.3 billion and $3.76. Results benefited by a $109 million or $0.09 per share after tax gain on the sale of the Companys minority ownership interest in Pret A Manger, reflected in Gain on sale of investment. The Company repurchased 37.8 million shares of its stock for nearly $2.7 billion in 2010 and 50.3 million shares of its stock for $2.9 billion in 2009, driving reductions of over 2% and 3% of total shares outstanding, respectively, net of stock option exercises. REVENUES The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Over the past three years, the Company has continued to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, cash flow and returns through its refranchising strategy. The shift to a greater percent- age of franchised restaurants negatively impacted consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales shifted to franchised sales, where the Company receives rent and/or royalties based on a percent of sales. In 2010, constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales. The impact of refranchising on consolidated revenues lessened because the number of Company-operated restaurants sold to franchisees has declined compared with 2009 and 2008, in line with our overall strategy. In 2009, constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales and expansion, partly offset by the impact of refranchising in certain of the Companys major markets.

New products introduced in 2010 included McCaf frapps and smoothies as well as the Angus Snack Wraps, while new products introduced in 2009 included McCaf premium coffees and the Angus Third Pounder. Refranchising activity negatively impacted revenue growth in both years. Europes constant currency increases in revenues in 2010 and 2009 were primarily driven by comparable sales increases in the U.K., France and Russia (which is entirely Company-operated) as well as expansion in Russia. These increases were partly offset by the impact of refranchising activity, primarily in the U.K. in 2010 and the U.K. and Germany in 2009. In APMEA, the constant currency increase in revenues in 2010 was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in China, Australia and most other markets. The 2009 increase was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in Australia and most other Asian markets, partly offset by negative comparable sales in China. In addition, expansion in China contributed to the increases in both years.

Franchised margin dollars increased $479 million or 8% (8% in constant currencies) in 2010 and $254 million or 4% (7% in constant currencies) in 2009. Positive comparable sales were the primary driver of the constant currency growth in franchise margin dollars in both years. Refranchising activity also contributed to the constant currency growth in franchise margin dollars in 2009 and to a lesser extent in 2010.

The 2009 decrease was due to additional depreciation primarily related to the Companys investment in the beverage initiative, partly offset by positive comparable sales. Europes franchised margin percent decreased in 2010 and 2009 as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher occupancy expenses, the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives and the refranchising strategy. In APMEA, the franchised margin percent decrease in 2010 was primarily driven by foreign currency translation, mostly due to the stronger Australian dollar. The franchised margin percent in APMEA and Other Countries  Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. ##TABLE_START   Company-operated margins ##TABLE_END Company-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company-operated margin dollars increased $366 million or 13% (12% in constant currencies) in 2010 and decreased $101 million or 3% (increased 3% in constant currencies) in 2009. Positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs were the primary drivers of the constant currency growth in Company-operated margin dollars and percent in 2010. Positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher commodity costs, drove growth in constant currency Company-operated margin dollars and percent in 2009. In addition, refranchising activity negatively impacted Company-operated margin dollars, but benefited Company-operated margin percent in 2009 and to a lesser extent in 2010.

The margin percent increased in 2009 due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by additional depreciation related to the beverage initiative and higher commodity costs. Refranchising had a positive impact on both periods. Europes Company-operated margin percent increased in 2010 primarily due to positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs, partly offset by higher labor costs. The margin percent increased in 2009 primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher commodity and labor costs. In 2009, local inflation and the impact of weaker currencies on the cost of certain imported products drove higher costs, primarily in Russia, and negatively impacted the Company-operated margin percent. In APMEA, the Company-operated margin percent increased in 2010 primarily due to positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs, partly offset by higher occupancy  other costs and increased labor costs. The margin percent increased in 2009 due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs. ##TABLE_START   Supplemental information regarding Company-operated restaurants ##TABLE_END We continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve these goals, but as previously stated, Company-operated restaurants are also important to our success. We report results for Company-operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs. We report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general  administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company-operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company-operated restaurants generally include gains/losses on sales of restaurant businesses and write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. We believe the following information about Company-operated restaurants in our most significant markets provides an additional perspective on this business. Management responsible for our Company-operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the Company-operated business on this basis to assess its performance. Management of the Company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix, subject to other relevant considerations. The following table seeks to illustrate the two components of our Company-operated margins. The first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations, which we refer to as Store operating margin. The second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties. We refer to this component as Brand/real estate margin. Both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties, although rent and royalties for Company-operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation. Rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales, and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of McDonalds investment in the restaurant. Royalty rates may also vary by market. As shown in the following table, in disaggregating the components of our Company-operated margins, certain costs with respect to Company-operated restaurants are reflected in Brand/real estate margin. Those costs consist of rent payable by McDonalds to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy  other operating expenses recorded in the Consolidated statement of income. Store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses, and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating Brand/real estate margin. While we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our Company-operated business, it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In particular, as noted previously, we do not allocate selling, general  administrative expenses to our Company-operated business. However, we believe that a range of $40,000 to $50,000 per restaurant, on average, is a typical range of costs to support this business in the U.S. The actual costs in markets outside the U.S. will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market. These costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant.  ##TABLE_START   U.S.      Europe  Dollars in millions  2010   2009   2008       2010   2009   2008  As reported        Number of Company-operated restaurants at year end   1,550    1,578    1,782     2,005    2,001    2,024  Sales by Company-operated restaurants  $ 4,229   $ 4,295   $ 4,636    $ 6,932   $ 6,721   $ 7,424  Company-operated margin  $ 902   $ 832   $ 856       $ 1,373   $ 1,240   $ 1,340  Store operating margin        Company-operated margin  $ 902   $ 832   $ 856    $ 1,373   $ 1,240   $ 1,340  Plus:        Outside rent expense (1)   60    65    74     223    222    254  Depreciationbuildings  leasehold improvements (1)   65    70    70     105    100    110  Less:        Rent  royalties (2)   (619 )   (634 )   (684 )       (1,335 )   (1,306 )   (1,435 ) Store operating margin  $ 408   $ 333   $ 316       $ 366   $ 256   $ 269  Brand/real estate margin        Rent  royalties (2)  $ 619   $ 634   $ 684    $ 1,335   $ 1,306   $ 1,435  Less:        Outside rent expense (1)   (60 )   (65 )   (74 )    (223 )   (222 )   (254 ) Depreciationbuildings  leasehold improvements (1)   (65 )   (70 )   (70 )       (105 )   (100 )   (110 ) Brand/real estate margin  $ 494   $ 499   $ 540       $ 1,007   $ 984   $ 1,071  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Represents certain costs recorded as occupancy  other operating expenses in the Consolidated statement of income  rent payable by McDonalds to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements.

The Vancouver Winter Olympics in February and the Companys biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention in April contributed to the increase in 2010. The 2009 expenses decreased partly due to costs in 2008 related to the Beijing Summer Olympics and the Companys biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention.

Selling, general  administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales were 3.0% in 2010 compared with 3.1% in 2009 and 3.3% in 2008. Management believes that analyzing selling, general  administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales, as well as revenues, is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support Systemwide restaurants.  IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER CHARGES (CREDITS), NET The Company recorded impairment and other charges (credits), net of $29 million in 2010, ($61) million in 2009 and $6 million in 2008. Management does not include these items when reviewing business performance trends because we do not believe these items are indicative of expected ongoing results.

In 2009, the Company recorded income of $61 million related primarily to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. The Company also recognized a tax benefit in 2009 in connection with this income, mainly related to the release of a tax valuation allowance.

The Companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. The Company realized lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses in 2010 compared with 2009 and 2008 primarily as a result of selling less Company-operated restaurants to franchisees. ##TABLE_START   Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates ##TABLE_END Unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates, but does not control. The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonalds share of results. For foreign affiliated markets  primarily Japan  results are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonalds share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. is reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. Results in 2010 reflected a reduction in the number of unconsolidated affiliate restaurants worldwide partly offset by improved operating performance in Japan. Results in 2009 also reflected improved operating performance in Japan and benefited from the stronger Japanese Yen. ##TABLE_START   Asset dispositions and other expense ##TABLE_END Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for restaurant closings and uncollectible receivables, asset write-offs due to restaurant reinvestment, and other miscellaneous income and expenses.

In the U.S., 2010 results increased due to higher combined restaurant margin dollars. Results for 2009 increased primarily due to higher franchised margin dollars. In Europe, results for 2010 and 2009 were driven by stronger operating performance in France, Russia and the U.K. In APMEA, 2010 results increased due to stronger results in Australia and many other markets. The Companys share of impairment charges related to restaurant closings in Japan negatively impacted the growth rate by 4 percentage points for the year. Results for 2009 were driven primarily by strong results in Australia and expansion in China. In Other Countries  Corporate, results for 2010 and 2009 included income of $21 million and $65 million, respectively, primarily related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. ##TABLE_START   Combined operating margin ##TABLE_END Combined operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. Combined operating margin for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was 31.0%, 30.1% and 27.4%, respectively. Impairment and other charges (credits), net negatively impacted the combined operating margin by 0.2 percentage points in 2010, while positively impacting it by 0.3 percentage points in 2009. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense decreased in 2010 primarily due to lower average interest rates slightly offset by higher average debt balances. Interest expense decreased in 2009 primarily due to lower average interest rates, and to a lesser extent, weaker foreign currencies, partly offset by higher average debt levels.

Interest income decreased in 2009 primarily due to lower average interest rates. Foreign currency and hedging activity primarily relates to net gains or losses on certain hedges that reduce the exposure to variability on certain intercompany foreign currency cash flow streams. Other expense primarily consists of amortization of debt issuance costs and other nonoperating income and expenses. GAIN ON SALE OF INVESTMENT In 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox to Coinstar, Inc., the majority owner, for total consideration of $140 million. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $95 million (after tax$59 million or $0.05 per share). In 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K.-based Pret A Manger. In connection with the sale, the Company received cash proceeds of $229 million and recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $160 million (after tax$109 million or $0.09 per share). PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the reported effective income tax rates were 29.3%, 29.8% and 30.0%, respectively. In 2010, the effective income tax rate decreased due to higher tax benefits related to foreign operations. In 2009, the effective income tax rate benefited by 0.7 percentage points primarily due to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the U.S. and other profitable markets. ACCOUNTING CHANGES ##TABLE_START   Fair value measurements ##TABLE_END In 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on fair value measurements, codified primarily in the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). This guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This guidance does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The provisions of the guidance, as issued, were effective January 1, 2008. However, in February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date for one year for certain non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial  statements on a recurring basis (i.e., at least annually). The Company adopted the required provisions related to debt and derivatives as of January 1, 2008 and adopted the remaining required provisions for non-financial assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2009. The effect of adoption was not significant in either period. ##TABLE_START   Variable interest entities and consolidation ##TABLE_END In June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance on variable interest entities and consolidation, codified primarily in the Consolidation Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance modifies the method for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity as well as the methods permitted for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. In addition, this guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and enhanced disclosures related to a companys involvement with a variable interest entity. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2010. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers, and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entities is not appropriate for the periods presented. As a result, the adoption did not have any impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Cash Flows The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $6.3 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.2 billion in 2010, while cash provided by operations totaled $5.8 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $3.8 billion in 2009. In 2010, cash provided by operations increased $591 million or 10% compared with 2009 primarily due to increased operating results. In 2009, cash provided by operations decreased $166 million or 3% compared with 2008 despite increased operating results, primarily due to higher income tax payments, higher noncash income items and the receipt of $143 million in 2008 related to the completion of an IRS examination. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.1 billion in 2010, an increase of $401 million compared with 2009. This reflects higher capital expenditures and lower proceeds from sales of investments and restaurant businesses. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.7 billion in 2009, an increase of $31 million compared with 2008. This reflects lower proceeds from sales of investments, restaurant businesses and property, offset by lower capital expenditures, primarily in the U.S. Cash used for financing activities totaled $3.7 billion in 2010, a decrease of $692 million compared with 2009, primarily due to higher net debt issuances, higher proceeds from stock option exercises and lower treasury stock purchases, partly offset by an increase in the common stock dividend. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.4 billion in 2009, an increase of $307 million compared with 2008, primarily due to lower net debt issuances, an increase in the common stock dividend and lower proceeds from stock option exercises, partly offset by lower treasury stock purchases. As a result of the above activity, the Companys cash and equivalents balance increased $591 million in 2010 to $2.4 billion, compared with a decrease of $267 million in 2009. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In 2010, the Company opened 957 traditional restaurants and 35 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 406 traditional restaurants and 327 satellite restaurants. Of these closures, there were over 400 in McDonalds Japan due to the strategic review of the markets restaurant portfolio. In 2009, the Company opened 824 traditional restaurants and 44 satellite restaurants and closed 215 traditional restaurants and 142 satellite restaurants. The majority of restaurant openings and closings occurred in the major markets in both years. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.

About 80% of the restaurants at year-end 2010 were franchised. Capital expenditures increased $183 million or 9% in 2010 primarily due to higher investment in new restaurants. Capital expenditures decreased $184 million or 9% in 2009 primarily due to fewer restaurant openings, lower reinvestment in existing restaurants in the U.S. and the impact of foreign currency translation. In both years, capital expenditures reflected the Companys commitment to grow sales at existing restaurants, including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in many markets around the world. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented over 65% of the total in 2010, 2009 and 2008. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.

Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $2.6 million in 2010. The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2010 and 2009. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS In 2010, the Company returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid. Shares repurchased and dividends ##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data  2010   2009   2008  Number of shares repurchased   37.8    50.3    69.7  Shares outstanding at year end   1,054    1,077    1,115  Dividends declared per share  $ 2.26   $ 2.05   $ 1.625  Dollar amount of shares repurchased  $ 2,649   $ 2,854   $ 3,981  Dividends paid   2,408    2,235    1,823  Total returned to shareholders  $ 5,057   $ 5,089   $ 5,804  ##TABLE_END In September 2009, the Companys Board of Directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date. In 2009 and 2010 combined, approximately 45 million shares have been repurchased for $3.1 billion under this program. This program replaced the $10 billion share repurchase program that the Companys Board of Directors approved in September 2007. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 35 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2010 full year dividend of $2.26 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.55 per share, with an increase to $0.61 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 11% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $2.44 per share annual dividend rate and reflects the Companys confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors. Financial Position and Capital Resources TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS Total assets increased $1.8 billion or 6% in 2010. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $1.7 billion in 2010. Over 70% of total assets were in major markets at year-end 2010. Net property and equipment increased $529 million in 2010 and represented about 70% of total assets at year end. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net property and equipment increased $719 million primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation. Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Returns on assets and equity ##TABLE_START    2010   2009   2008  Return on average assets   24.7 %   23.4 %   21.8 % Return on average common equity   35.3    34.0    30.6  ##TABLE_END In 2010, 2009 and 2008, return on average assets and return on average common equity benefited from strong global operating results. Operating income, as reported, does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by 1.9 percentage points, 2.0 percentage points and 1.9 percentage points in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. FINANCING AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2010 totaled $11.5 billion, compared with $10.6 billion at December 31, 2009. The net increase in 2010 was primarily due to net issuances of $787 million and changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt of $140 million.

See Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Includes the effect of interest rate exchange agreements. ##TABLE_END Fitch, Standard  Poors and Moodys currently rate, with a stable outlook, the Companys commercial paper F1, A-1 and P-1, respectively; and its long-term debt A, A and A2, respectively. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of  a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Under existing authorization from the Companys Board of Directors, at December 31, 2010, the Company has $3 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to registered debt securities on a U.S. shelf registration statement and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $1.3 billion available under committed line of credit agreements as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and Global market (see Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2011 is approximately $601 million of long-term corporate debt. In 2011, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. The Company also has $595 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings outstanding at year-end 2010. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All exchange agreements are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Companys restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2010, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position. The Companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures ##TABLE_START In millions of U.S. Dollars  2010   2009  Euro  $ 5,465   $ 5,151  Australian Dollars   2,075    1,460  Canadian Dollars   1,123    981  Russian Ruble   589    501  British Pounds Sterling   547    679  ##TABLE_END The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2010 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2010 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Companys borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2010. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details. ##TABLE_START    Contractual cash outflows      Contractual cash inflows  In millions  Operating leases   Debt obligations (1)       Minimum rent under franchise arrangements  2011  $ 1,200   $ 8    $ 2,349  2012   1,116    2,212     2,289  2013   1,034    1,007     2,216  2014   926    708     2,120  2015   827    675     2,001  Thereafter   6,018    6,818        15,379  Total  $ 11,121   $ 11,428       $ 26,354  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) The maturities reflect reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $1.2 billion, as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in March 2012. Debt obligations do not include $77 million of noncash fair value hedging adjustments or $201 million of accrued interest. ##TABLE_END The Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of IRS limitations. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $439 million. In addition, total liabilities for international retirement plans were $153 million and the Company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $573 million. Other Matters CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: ##TABLE_START   Property and equipment ##TABLE_END Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. ##TABLE_START   Share-based compensation ##TABLE_END The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Companys stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. ##TABLE_START   Long-lived assets impairment review ##TABLE_END Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Companys experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Companys estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment  charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual country) with goodwill currently at risk of impairment. ##TABLE_START   Litigation accruals ##TABLE_END From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. ##TABLE_START   Income taxes ##TABLE_END The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. In 2010, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its field examination of the Companys U.S. federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. As part of this exam, the Company resolved proposed adjustments related to transfer pricing matters that were previously received from the IRS. The tax provision impact associated with the completion of this field examination was not significant. The Company continues to disagree with the IRS proposed adjustments related to certain foreign tax credits of about $400 million, excluding interest and potential penalties. The Company continues to believe that these adjustments are not justified, and intends to pursue all available remedies. The Company cannot predict with certainty the timing of resolution; however, the Company does not believe the resolution will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows. During 2008, the IRS examination of the Companys 2005 and 2006 U.S. federal income tax returns was completed. The tax provision impact associated with the completion of this examination was not significant. The IRS examination of the Companys 2009 and 2010 U.S. federal income tax returns is expected to begin in 2011. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $11.0 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If managements intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICESINFLATION The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. RECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Companys incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period. The denominator is the weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one- or three-year period. Adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the Boston Market, Latin America developmental license, Pret A Manger and Redbox transactions. The weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarters investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2010 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2010 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2009 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full year impact on 2010 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2009 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average.  The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows (dollars in millions) : One-year ROIIC Calculation ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2009   Incremental change  NUMERATOR:    Operating income  $ 7,473.1   $ 6,841.0   $ 632.1  Depreciation and amortization   1,276.2    1,216.2    60.0  Currency translation (1)    (22.2 ) Incremental adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 669.9  DENOMINATOR:   Weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities (2)    $ 1,821.1  Currency translation (1)    (26.5 ) Weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates)    $ 1,794.6  One-year ROIIC (3)    37.3 %  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Represents one-year weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the adjusted cash used for investing activities for each quarter in the two-year period ended December 31, 2010. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Years ended December 31,     2009       2010  Cash used for investing activities  $ 1,655.3    $ 2,056.0  Less: Cash generated from investing activities related to Redbox transaction   (144.9 )         Adjusted cash used for investing activities  $ 1,800.2       $ 2,056.0  AS A PERCENT    Quarters ended:    March 31   12.5 %    87.5 % June 30   37.5     62.5  September 30   62.5     37.5  December 31   87.5        12.5  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) The impact of impairment and other charges (credits), net between 2010 and 2009 negatively impacted the one-year ROIIC by 4.3 percentage points. ##TABLE_ENDThree-year ROIIC Calculation ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2010   2007   Incremental change  NUMERATOR:    Operating income  $ 7,473.1   $ 3,879.0   $ 3,594.1  Depreciation and amortization (4)   1,276.2    1,192.8    83.4  Latin America developmental license transaction ( 5 )    1,665.3    (1,665.3 ) Currency translation ( 6 )           137.8  Incremental adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 2,150.0  DENOMINATOR:   Weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities ( 7 )    $ 5,626.3  Currency translation ( 6 )    (17.9 ) Weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 5,608.4  Three-year ROIIC ( 8 )    38.3 % ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4) Represents depreciation and amortization from continuing operations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (5) Represents impairment charges as a result of the Companys sale of its businesses in 18 Latin American and Caribbean markets to a developmental licensee. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (6) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (7) Represents three-year weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the adjusted cash used for investing activities for each quarter in the four-year period ended December 31, 2010. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Years ended December 31,     2007   2008   2009   2010  Cash used for investing activities  $ 1,150.1   $ 1,624.7   $ 1,655.3   $ 2,056.0  Less: Cash generated from investing activities related to  Boston Market transaction   (184.3 )    Latin America developmental license transaction   (647.5 )    Pret A Manger transaction    (229.4 )   Redbox transaction           (144.9 )     Adjusted cash used for investing activities  $ 1,981.9   $ 1,854.1   $ 1,800.2   $ 2,056.0  AS A PERCENT     Quarters ended:     March 31   12.5 %   100.0 %   100.0 %   87.5 % June 30   37.5    100.0    100.0    62.5  September 30   62.5    100.0    100.0    37.5  December 31   87.5    100.0    100.0    12.5  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (8) The impact of impairment and other charges (credits), net between 2010 and 2007 did not impact the three-year ROIIC. ##TABLE_END RISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook for 2011.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Summary of Significant Accounting Policies NATURE OF BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants in the global restaurant industry. All restaurants are operated either by the Company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchise arrangements, and foreign affiliates and developmental licensees under license agreements. The following table presents restaurant information by ownership type: ##TABLE_START Restaurants at December 31,  2010   2009   2008  Conventional franchised   19,279    19,020    18,402  Developmental licensed   3,485    3,160    2,926  Foreign affiliated   3,574    4,036    4,137  Franchised   26,338    26,216    25,465  Company-operated   6,399    6,262    6,502  Systemwide restaurants   32,737    32,478    31,967  ##TABLE_END CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily McDonalds Japan) are accounted for by the equity method. In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amendments to the guidance on variable interest entities and consolidation, codified primarily in the Consolidation Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). This guidance modifies the method for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity as well as the methods permitted for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. In addition, this guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and enhanced disclosures related to a companys involvement with a variable interest entity. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2010. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers, and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented. As a result, the adoption did not have any impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and foreign affiliates. Sales by Company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis. The Company presents sales net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and may include initial fees. Continuing rent and royalties are recognized in the period earned. Initial fees are recognized upon opening of a restaurant or granting of a new franchise term, which is when the Company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise arrangement. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Generally, the functional currency of operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency. ADVERTISING COSTS Advertising costs included in operating expenses of Company-operated restaurants primarily consist of contributions to advertising cooperatives and were (in millions): 2010$687.0; 2009$650.8; 2008$703.4. Production costs for radio and television advertising are expensed when the commercials are initially aired. These production costs, primarily in the U.S., as well as other marketing-related expenses included in selling, general  administrative expenses were (in millions): 2010$94.5; 2009$94.7; 2008$79.2. In addition, significant advertising costs are incurred by franchisees through contributions to advertising cooperatives in individual markets. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Share-based compensation includes the portion vesting of all share-based payments granted based on the grant date fair value. Share-based compensation expense and the effect on diluted earnings per common share were as follows: ##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data  2010   2009   2008  Share-based compensation expense  $ 83.1   $ 112.9   $ 112.5  After tax  $ 56.2   $ 76.1   $ 75.1  Earnings per common share-diluted  $ 0.05   $ 0.07   $ 0.07  ##TABLE_END Compensation expense related to share-based awards is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in selling, general  administrative expenses in the Consolidated statement of income. As of December 31, 2010, there was $90.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for the 2010, 2009 and 2008 stock option grants. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical trends. Expected stock price volatility is generally based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock for a period approximating the expected life. The expected dividend yield is based on the Companys most recent annual dividend payout. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life.  Weighted-average assumptions ##TABLE_START    2010   2009   2008  Expected dividend yield   3.5 %   3.2 %   2.6%  Expected stock price volatility   22.1 %   24.4 %   24.9%  Risk-free interest rate   2.8 %   2.0 %   3.0%  Expected life of options In years   6.2    6.2    6.2  Fair value per option granted  $ 9.90   $ 9.66   $ 11.85  ##TABLE_ENDPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildingsup to 40 years; leasehold improvementsthe lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include option periods; and equipmentthree to 12 years. GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurant businesses. The Companys goodwill primarily results from purchases of McDonalds restaurants from franchisees and ownership increases in subsidiaries or affiliates, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit (defined as each individual country). The Company conducts goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever an indicator of impairment exists. If an indicator of impairment exists (e.g., estimated earnings multiple value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value), the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit, generally based on discounted future cash flows, with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill and the carrying amount of goodwill. Historically, goodwill impairment has not significantly impacted the consolidated financial statements. The following table presents the 2010 activity in goodwill by segment: ##TABLE_START In millions  U.S.   Europe   APMEA (1)   Other Countries  Corporate (2)   Consolidated  Balance at December 31, 2009  $ 1,151.6   $ 790.7    $346.4    $136.5    $2,425.2  Net restaurant purchases (sales)   60.4    23.0    2.2    48.5    134.1  Acquisition of subsidiaries/affiliates      9.7    9.7  Currency translation       (28.2 )   36.4    8.9    17.1  Balance at December 31, 2010  $ 1,212.0   $ 785.5    $385.0    $203.6    $2,586.1  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) APMEA represents Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Other Countries  Corporate represents Canada, Latin America and Corporate. ##TABLE_END LONG-LIVED ASSETS Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing McDonalds restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together at a television market level in the U.S. and at a country level for each of the international markets. The Company manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurants cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment (e.g., negative operating cash flows for the most recent trailing 24-month period) exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows. Losses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal, the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses relate to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered available for sale. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, and certain non-financial assets and liabilities on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value disclosures are reflected in a three-level hierarchy, maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: ##TABLE_START   Level 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for an identical asset or liability in an active market. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Level 2  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for a similar asset or liability in an active market or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Level 3  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END Certain of the Companys derivatives are valued using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate observable market parameters, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates, classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. Derivative valuations incorporate credit risk adjustments that are necessary to reflect the probability of default by the counterparty or the Company. ##TABLE_START   Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value ##TABLE_END The following tables present financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the valuation hierarchy as defined in the fair value guidance: ##TABLE_START December 31, 2010  In millions  Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Carrying Value  Cash equivalents  $ 722.5     $ 722.5  Investments   131.6 *     131.6  Derivative receivables   104.4 *  $ 88.5        192.9  Total assets at fair value  $ 958.5   $ 88.5       $ 1,047.0  Derivative payables      $ (8.4 )      $ (8.4 ) Total liabilities at fair value      $ (8.4 )      $ (8.4 ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START December 31, 2009  In millions  Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Carrying Value  Cash equivalents  $ 455.8     $ 455.8  Investments   115.7 *     115.7  Derivative receivables   79.6 *  $ 94.5        174.1  Total assets at fair value  $ 651.1   $ 94.5       $ 745.6  Derivative payables      $ (7.0 )      $ (7.0 ) Total liabilities at fair value      $ (7.0 )      $ (7.0 ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START * Includes long-term investments and derivatives that hedge market driven changes in liabilities associated with the Companys supplemental benefit plans. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis ##TABLE_END Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). At December 31, 2010, no material fair value adjustments or fair value measurements were required for non-financial assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_START   Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2010, the fair value of the Companys debt obligations was estimated at $12.5 billion, compared to a carrying amount of $11.5 billion. This fair value was estimated using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated quoted market prices and are similar to Level 2 inputs within the valuation hierarchy. The carrying amount for both cash equivalents and notes receivable approximate fair value. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt and derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of these changes. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. The Company documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions, as well as all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items. The Companys derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments consist mainly of interest rate exchange agreements, forward foreign currency exchange agreements and foreign currency options. Interest rate exchange agreements are entered into to manage the interest rate risk associated with the Companys fixed and floating-rate borrowings. Forward foreign currency exchange agreements and foreign currency options are entered into to mitigate the risk that forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies) will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Certain foreign currency denominated debt is used, in part, to protect the value of the Companys investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also enters into certain derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments. The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in selling, general  administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses forward foreign currency exchange agreements and foreign currency exchange agreements to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Since these derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments, the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in nonoperating (income) expense together with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. A portion of the Companys foreign currency options (more fully described in the Cash Flow Hedging Strategy section) are undesignated as hedging instruments as the underlying foreign currency royalties are earned. All derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments are classified as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. All derivatives (including those not designated as hedging instruments) are recognized on the Consolidated balance sheet at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity date. Changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments are reflected as adjustments to other comprehensive income (OCI) and/or current earnings.  The following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included on the Consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010 and 2009: ##TABLE_START    Asset Derivatives   Liability Derivatives  In millions  Balance Sheet Classification       2010   2009       Balance Sheet Classification   2010       2009  Derivatives designated as hedging instruments          Foreign currency    Prepaid expenses and other current assets     $ 7.5   $ 13.5      Accrued payroll and other liabilities    $ (4.6 )   $ (0.1 ) Interest rate    Prepaid expenses and other current assets      0.5    1.4       Foreign currency    Miscellaneous other assets       5.4       Interest rate    Miscellaneous other assets         72.1    67.3         Other long-term liabilities     (0.3 )       (3.4 ) Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments          $ 80.1   $ 87.6           $ (4.9 )      $ (3.5 ) Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments          Foreign currency    Prepaid expenses and other current assets     $ 6.0   $ 9.3      Accrued payroll and other liabilities    $ (3.8 )   $ (5.4 ) Equity    Prepaid expenses and other current assets      104.4        Equity    Miscellaneous other assets       79.6       Foreign currency    Miscellaneous other assets         2.7             Other long-term liabilities             (0.5 ) Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments          $ 113.1   $ 88.9           $ (3.8 )      $ (5.9 ) Total derivatives 1          $ 193.2   $ 176.5           $ (8.7 )      $ (9.4 ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 The fair value of derivatives is presented on a gross basis. Accordingly, the 2010 and 2009 total asset and liability fair values do not agree with the values provided in the Fair Value Measurements note, because that disclosure reflects netting adjustments of $0.3 million and $2.4 million. ##TABLE_END The following table presents the pretax amounts affecting income and OCI for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively: ##TABLE_START In millions                      Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships      (Gain) Loss Recognized in Income on Derivative          Hedged Items in Fair Value Hedging Relationships          (Gain) Loss Recognized in Income on Related Hedged Items       2010    2009       2010    2009  Interest rate   $ (7.0 )  $ 17.3     Fixed-rate debt    $ 7.0   $ (17.3 ) Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships       (Gain) Loss Recognized in Accumulated OCI on Derivative (Effective Portion)           (Gain) Loss Reclassified from Accumulated OCI into Income (Effective Portion)            (Gain) Loss Recognized in Income on Derivative (Amount Excluded from Effectiveness Testing and Ineffective Portion)         2010    2009      2010    2009     2010    2009  Foreign currency   $ (11.2 )  $ 3.4     $(13.4 )  $ (48.3 )   $ 25.1   $ 27.0  Interest rate (1)         (2.1 )     (0.9 )    (2.1 )     (0.3 )      Total    $ (11.2 )  $ 1.3      $(14.3 )  $ (50.4 )    $ 24.8   $ 27.0  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Net Investment Hedging Relationships   (Gain) Loss Recognized in Accumulated OCI on Derivative (Effective Portion)   Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments      (Gain) Loss Recognized in Income on Derivative      2010  2009      2010    2009  Foreign currency denominated debt   $144.3  $51.3   Foreign currency   $ (16.4 )  $ (12.2 ) Foreign currency derivatives    4.3     Equity (2)     (18.8 )   (2.4 ) Total    $148.6  $51.3   Total    $ (35.2 )  $ (14.6 ) ##TABLE_END (Gains) losses recognized in income on derivatives are recorded in nonoperating (income) expense unless otherwise noted. ##TABLE_START (1) The amount of (gain) loss reclassified from accumulated OCI into income is recorded in interest expense. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) The amount of (gain) loss recognized in income on the derivatives used to hedge the supplemental benefit plan liabilities is recorded in selling, general  administrative expenses. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START   Fair Value Hedging Strategy ##TABLE_END The Company enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure to changes in the fair values of certain liabilities. The fair value hedges the Company enters into consist of interest rate exchange agreements which convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt. All of the Companys interest rate exchange agreements meet the shortcut method requirements. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate exchange agreements are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying debt. No ineffectiveness has been recorded to net income related to interest rate exchange agreements designated as fair value hedges for the year ended December 31, 2010. A total of $2.3 billion of the Companys outstanding fixed-rate debt was effectively converted to floating-rate debt resulting from the use of interest rate exchange agreements. ##TABLE_START   Cash Flow Hedging Strategy ##TABLE_END The Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. The types of cash flow hedges the Company enters into include interest rate exchange agreements, forward foreign currency exchange agreements and foreign currency options. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies), the Company uses forward foreign currency exchange agreements and foreign currency options to hedge a portion of anticipated exposures. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the decline in present value of future foreign denominated royalties is offset by gains in the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange agreements and/or foreign currency options. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in the present value of future foreign denominated royalties is offset by losses in the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange agreements and/or foreign currency options. Although the fair value changes in the foreign currency options may fluctuate over the period of the contract, the Companys total loss on a foreign currency option is limited to the upfront premium paid for the contract. However, the potential gains on a foreign currency option are unlimited as the settlement value of the contract is based upon the difference between the exchange rate at inception of the contract and the spot exchange rate at maturity. In limited situations, the Company uses foreign currency option collars, which limit the potential gains and lower the upfront premium paid, to protect against currency movements. The hedges typically cover the next 12-15 months for certain exposures and are denominated in various currencies. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had derivatives outstanding with an equivalent notional amount of $434.4 million that were used to hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency denominated royalties. The Company excludes the time value of foreign currency options, as well as the discount or premium points on forward foreign currency exchange agreements, from its effectiveness assessment on its cash flow hedges. As a result, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to these components, as well as the ineffectiveness of the hedges, are recognized in earnings currently. The effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is reported in the deferred hedging adjustment component of OCI in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company recorded after tax adjustments related to cash flow hedges to the deferred hedging adjustment component of accumulated OCI in shareholders equity. The Company recorded a net decrease of $1.5 million and $31.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Based on interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2010, no significant amount of the $15.0 million in cumulative deferred hedging gains, after tax, at December 31, 2010, will be recognized in earnings over the next 12 months as the underlying hedged transactions are realized. ##TABLE_START   Hedge of Net Investment in Foreign Operations Strategy ##TABLE_END The Company primarily uses foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders equity in the foreign currency translation component of OCI and offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in OCI. As of December 31, 2010, a total of $3.5 billion of the Companys outstanding foreign currency denominated debt was designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. ##TABLE_START   Credit Risk ##TABLE_END The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its hedging instruments. The counterparties to these agreements consist of a diverse group of financial institutions. The Company continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and adjusts positions as appropriate. The Company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2010 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2010, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where its counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions. INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES The Company, like other multi-national companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. Accordingly, tax liabilities are recorded when, in managements judgment, a tax position does not meet the more  likely than not threshold for recognition. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may be recorded depending on managements assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled. The Company records interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION Diluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of shares): 201014.3; 200915.2; 2008 19.4. Stock options that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutive were (in millions of shares): 20100.0; 20090.7; 20080.6. The Company has elected to exclude the pro forma deferred tax asset associated with share-based compensation in earnings per share. STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS The Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There were no subsequent events that required recognition or disclosure. Property and Equipment Net property and equipment consisted of: ##TABLE_START In millions  December 31, 2010   2009  Land   $ 5,200.5   $ 5,048.3  Buildings and improvements on owned land   12,399.4    12,119.0  Buildings and improvements on leased land   11,732.0    11,347.9  Equipment, signs and seating   4,608.5    4,422.9  Other   542.0    502.4    34,482.4    33,440.5  Accumulated depreciation and amortization   (12,421.8 )    (11,909.0 ) Net property and equipment   $ 22,060.6   $ 21,531.5  ##TABLE_END Depreciation and amortization expense was (in millions): 2010$1,200.4; 2009$1,160.8; 2008$1,161.6.

These actions were designed to enhance the brand image, overall profitability and returns of the market. The Company also recorded pretax income of $21.0 million related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. In 2009, the Company recorded pretax income of $65.2 million related primarily to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. The Company also recognized a tax benefit in 2009 in connection with this income, mainly related to the release of a tax valuation allowance.

The Companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. ##TABLE_START   Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates ##TABLE_END Unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control. The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonalds share of results. For foreign affiliated markets  primarily Japan  results are reported after interest  expense and income taxes. McDonalds share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. are reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. ##TABLE_START   Asset dispositions and other expense ##TABLE_END Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for restaurant closings and uncollectible receivables, asset write-offs due to restaurant reinvestment, and other miscellaneous income and expenses. Gain on Sale of Investment In 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox Automated Retail, LLC to Coinstar, Inc., the majority owner, for total consideration of $139.8 million. In connection with the sale, in first quarter 2009, the Company received initial consideration valued at $51.6 million consisting of 1.5 million shares of Coinstar common stock at an agreed to value of $41.6 million and $10 million in cash with the balance of the purchase price deferred. In subsequent quarters of 2009, the Company sold all of its holdings in the Coinstar common stock for $46.8 million and received $88.2 million in cash from Coinstar as final consideration. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $94.9 million (after tax$58.8 million or $0.05 per share). In second quarter 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K.-based Pret A Manger. In connection with the sale, the Company received cash proceeds of $229.4 million and recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $160.1 million (after tax$109.0 million or $0.09 per share). Contingencies From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. In connection with the sale in 2007 of its businesses in 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to a developmental licensee organization, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims, certain of which are reflected on McDonalds Consolidated balance sheet (2010 and 2009: other long-term liabilities$49.6 million and $71.8 million, respectively; 2010 and 2009: accrued payroll and other liabilities$28.4 million and $25.3 million, respectively). The change in the total balance was primarily a result of the resolution of certain of these liabilities. The Company believes any other matters currently being reviewed will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operation. Franchise Arrangements Conventional franchise arrangements generally include a lease and a license and provide for payment of initial fees, as well as continuing rent and royalties to the Company based upon a percent of sales with minimum rent payments that parallel the Companys underlying leases and escalations (on properties that are leased). Under this arrangement, franchisees are granted the right to operate a restaurant using the McDonalds System and, in most cases, the use of a restaurant facility, generally for a period of 20 years. These franchisees pay related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. Affiliates and developmental licensees operating under license agreements pay a royalty to the Company based upon a percent of sales, and may pay initial fees. The results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees were not material either individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale. Revenues from franchised restaurants consisted of: ##TABLE_START In millions  2010   2009   2008  Rents  $ 5,198.4   $ 4,841.0   $ 4,612.8  Royalties   2,579.2    2,379.8    2,275.7  Initial fees   63.7    65.4    73.0  Revenues from franchised restaurants  $ 7,841.3   $ 7,286.2   $ 6,961.5  ##TABLE_END Future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements are: ##TABLE_START In millions  Owned sites   Leased sites   Total  2011  $ 1,244.4   $ 1,104.6   $ 2,349.0  2012   1,213.7    1,075.6    2,289.3  2013   1,177.1    1,038.5    2,215.6  2014   1,132.6    986.9    2,119.5  2015   1,075.3    926.1    2,001.4  Thereafter   8,664.2    6,715.1    15,379.3  Total minimum payments  $ 14,507.3   $ 11,846.8   $ 26,354.1  ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2010, net property and equipment under franchise arrangements totaled $13.4 billion (including land of $3.9 billion) after deducting accumulated depreciation and amortization of $6.7 billion. Leasing Arrangements At December 31, 2010, the Company was the lessee at 13,957 restaurant locations through ground leases (the Company leases the land and the Company or franchisee owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases land and buildings). Lease terms for most restaurants, where market conditions allow, are generally for 20 years and, in many cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options, with certain leases providing purchase options. Escalation terms vary by geographic segment with examples including fixed-rent escalations, escalations based on an inflation index, and fair-value market adjustments. The timing of these escalations generally ranges from annually to every five years. For most locations, the Company is obligated for the related occupancy costs including  property taxes, insurance and maintenance; however, for franchised sites, the Company requires the franchisees to pay these costs. In addition, the Company is the lessee under noncancelable leases covering certain offices and vehicles.

After considering the deferred tax accounting impact, it is expected that about $390 million of the total as of December 31, 2010 would favorably affect the effective tax rate if resolved in the Companys favor.

Of the 2009 balance, $285.6 is included in long-term liabilities and $206.4 is included in deferred income taxes on the Consolidated balance sheet. ##TABLE_END In 2010, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its field examination of the Companys U.S. federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. As part of this exam, the Company has resolved proposed adjustments related to transfer pricing matters that were previously received from the IRS. The tax provision impact associated with the completion of this field examination was not significant. The Company continues to disagree with the IRS proposed adjustments related to certain foreign tax credits of about $400 million, excluding interest and potential penalties. The Company continues to believe that these adjustments are not justified, and intends to pursue all available remedies. While the Company cannot predict with certainty the timing of resolution, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that these issues will be settled in the next twelve months. The Company does not believe the resolution will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows. Excluding these adjustments, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next 12 months by $25 million to $40 million. This decrease would result from the expiration of the statute of limitations and the completion of tax audits in multiple tax jurisdictions. The Company is generally no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2004. The continuing practice of the Company is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in the provision for income taxes. The Company had $44.4 million and $18.7 million accrued for interest and penalties at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalties related to tax matters of $29.0 million in 2010, $1.5 million in 2009, and $13.7 million in 2008. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. These temporary differences were approximately $11.0 billion at December 31, 2010 and consisted primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. Determination of the deferred income tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs. Segment and Geographic Information The Company operates in the global restaurant industry and manages its business as distinct geographic segments. All intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in computing revenues and operating income. Corporate general  administrative expenses are included in Other Countries  Corporate and consist of home office support costs in areas such as facilities, finance, human resources, information technology, legal, marketing, restaurant operations, supply chain and training. Corporate assets include corporate cash and equivalents, asset portions of financial instruments and home office facilities. ##TABLE_START In millions  2010   2009   2008  U.S.  $ 8,111.6   $ 7,943.8   $ 8,078.3  Europe   9,569.2    9,273.8    9,922.9  APMEA   5,065.5    4,337.0    4,230.8  Other Countries  Corporate   1,328.3    1,190.1    1,290.4  Total revenues  $ 24,074.6   $ 22,744.7   $ 23,522.4  U.S.  $ 3,446.5   $ 3,231.7   $ 3,059.7  Europe   2,796.8    2,588.1    2,608.0  APMEA   1,199.9 (1)    989.5    818.8  Other Countries  Corporate   29.9 (2)    31.7 (3)    (43.6 ) Total operating income  $ 7,473.1   $ 6,841.0   $ 6,442.9  U.S.  $ 10,467.7   $ 10,429.3   $ 10,356.7  Europe   11,360.7    11,494.4    10,532.7  APMEA   5,374.0    4,409.0    4,074.6  Other Countries  Corporate   4,772.8    3,892.2    3,497.5  Total assets  $ 31,975.2   $ 30,224.9   $ 28,461.5  U.S.  $ 530.5   $ 659.4   $ 837.4  Europe   978.5    859.3    864.1  APMEA   493.1    354.6    360.6  Other Countries  Corporate   133.4    78.8    73.6  Total capital expenditures  $ 2,135.5   $ 1,952.1   $ 2,135.7  U.S.  $ 433.0   $ 423.8   $ 400.9  Europe   500.5    483.2    506.3  APMEA   232.4    202.9    193.4  Other Countries  Corporate   110.3    106.3    107.2  Total depreciation and amortization  $ 1,276.2   $ 1,216.2   $ 1,207.8  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Includes expense due to Impairment and other charges (credits), net of $39.3 million related to the Companys share of restaurant closing costs in McDonalds Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Includes income due to Impairment and other charges (credits), net of $21.0 million related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Includes income due to Impairment and other charges (credits), net of $65.2 million primarily related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. ##TABLE_END Total long-lived assets, primarily property and equipment, were (in millions)  Consolidated: 2010$26,700.9; 2009$25,896.1; 2008$24,385.8;. U.S. based: 2010$10,430.2; 2009$10,376.4; 2008$10,389.7.  Debt Financing LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS At December 31, 2010, the Company had a $1.3 billion line of credit agreement expiring in March 2012 with fees of 0.05% per annum on the total commitment, which remained unused. Fees and interest rates on this line are based on the Companys long-term credit rating assigned by Moodys and Standard  Poors. In addition, the Company including certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. had unused lines of credit totaling $952.0 million at December 31, 2010; these lines of credit were primarily uncommitted, short-term and denominated in various currencies at local market rates of interest. The weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings was 4.3% at December 31, 2010 (based on $595.0 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings) and 4.1% at December 31, 2009 (based on $598.7 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings). DEBT OBLIGATIONS The Company has incurred debt obligations principally through public and private offerings and bank loans. There are no provi- sions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions, and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. Under certain agreements, the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at par or at a premium over par. The Company has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt prior to maturity. ESOP LOANS Borrowings related to the leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) at December 31, 2010, which include $47.7 million of loans from the Company to the ESOP, are reflected as debt with a corresponding reduction of shareholders equity (additional paid-in capital included a balance of $41.7 million and $48.4 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively). The ESOP is repaying the loans and interest through 2018 using Company contributions and dividends from its McDonalds common stock holdings. As the principal amount of the borrowings is repaid, the debt and the unearned ESOP compensation (additional paid-in capital) are reduced. The following table summarizes the Companys debt obligations. (Interest rates and debt amounts reflected in the table include the effects of interest rate exchange agreements.) ##TABLE_START      Interest rates (1) December 31      Amounts outstanding December 31  In millions of U.S. Dollars  Maturity dates   2010   2009       2010   2009  Fixed    5.4 %   5.6 %   $ 5,318.0   $ 4,677.6  Floating       3.0    2.9        1,390.0    1,300.0  Total U.S. Dollars   2011-2040                6,708.0    5,977.6  Fixed    4.8    4.8     737.5    932.6  Floating       2.2    1.8        753.4    683.9  Total Euro   2011-2017                1,490.9    1,616.5  Total British Pounds Sterling-Fixed   2020-2032    6.0    6.0        700.7    726.2  Fixed    2.1    2.0     338.7    488.6  Floating       0.5    1.0        985.4    537.0  Total Japanese Yen   2011-2030                1,324.1    1,025.6  Fixed    2.5    2.7     451.6    359.6  Floating       4.1    3.8        752.6    793.3  Total other currencies (2)   2011-2021                1,204.2    1,152.9  Debt obligations before fair value adjustments (3)                   11,427.9    10,498.8  Fair value adjustments (4)                   77.4    79.6  Total debt obligations (5)                  $ 11,505.3   $ 10,578.4  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Weighted-average effective rate, computed on a semi-annual basis. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Primarily consists of Swiss Francs, Chinese Renminbi and Korean Won. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Aggregate maturities for 2010 debt balances, before fair value adjustments, were as follows (in millions): 2011$8.3; 2012$2,212.4; 2013$1,006.4; 2014-$707.9; 2015-$675.2; Thereafter$6,817.7. These amounts include a reclassification of short-term obligations totaling $1.2 billion to long-term obligations as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in March 2012. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4) The carrying value of underlying items in fair value hedges, in this case debt obligations, are adjusted for fair value changes to the extent they are attributable to the risk designated as being hedged. The related hedging instrument is also recorded at fair value in prepaid expenses and other current assets, miscellaneous other assets or other long-term liabilities. A portion ($5.1 million) of the adjustments at December 31, 2010 related to interest rate exchange agreements that were terminated in December 2002 and will amortize as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (5) Includes notes payable, current maturities of long-term debt and long-term debt included on the Consolidated balance sheet. The increase in debt obligations from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 was primarily due to (in millions): net issuances ($787.4) and changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt ($140.1). ##TABLE_END  Share-based Compensation The Company maintains a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plans was 70.9 million at December 31, 2010, including 31.2 million available for future grants. STOCK OPTIONS Stock options to purchase common stock are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Companys stock on the date of grant. Substantially all of the options become exercisable in four equal installments, beginning a year from the date of the grant, and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. Options granted between May 1, 1999 and December 31, 2000 (approximately 5.8 million options outstanding at December 31, 2010) expire 13 years from the date of grant. Intrinsic value for stock options is defined as the difference between the current market value of the Companys stock and the exercise price. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $500.8 million, $302.5 million and $549.5 million, respectively. Cash received from stock options exercised during 2010 was $463.1 million and the actual tax benefit realized for tax deductions from stock options exercised totaled $139.0 million. The Company uses treasury shares purchased under the Companys share repurchase program to satisfy share-based exercises. A summary of the status of the Companys stock option grants as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, and changes during the years then ended, is presented in the following table: ##TABLE_START    2010       2009           2008  Options  Shares in millions   Weighted- average exercise price   Weighted- average remaining contractual life in years   Aggregate intrinsic value in millions       Shares in millions   Weighted- average exercise price       Shares in millions   Weighted- average exercise price  Outstanding at beginning of year   47.8   $ 38.16       53.4   $ 34.88     67.5   $ 31.85  Granted   4.5    63.26       5.6    56.94     5.3    56.55  Exercised   (13.6 )   33.84       (10.7 )   31.17     (18.7 )   29.97  Forfeited/expired   (1.3 )   46.03                (0.5 )   47.22        (0.7 )   37.53  Outstanding at end of year   37.4   $ 42.47    5.1   $ 1,281.8        47.8   $ 38.16        53.4   $ 34.88  Exercisable at end of year   26.4   $ 35.88    3.8   $ 1,077.3        35.4            40.8      ##TABLE_END RSUs RSUs generally vest 100% on the third anniversary of the grant and are payable in either shares of McDonalds common stock or cash, at the Companys discretion. Certain executives have been awarded RSUs that vest based on Company performance. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. A summary of the Companys RSU activity during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is presented in the following table: ##TABLE_START    2010       2009       2008  RSUs  Shares in millions   Weighted- average grant date fair value       Shares in millions   Weighted- average grant date fair value       Shares in millions   Weighted- average grant date fair value  Nonvested at beginning of year   2.8   $ 46.33     3.0   $ 40.88     3.4   $ 35.94  Granted   0.7    56.09     0.9    50.34     0.8    51.10  Vested   (1.1 )   42.08     (1.0 )   34.56     (1.1 )   30.38  Forfeited   (0.1 )   49.61        (0.1 )   43.87        (0.1 )   40.41  Nonvested at end of year   2.3   $ 51.17        2.8   $ 46.33        3.0   $ 40.88  ##TABLE_END The Company realized tax deductions of $7.1 million from RSUs vested during 2010. The total fair value of RSUs vested during 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $66.8 million, $59.9 million and $56.4 million, respectively.  Employee Benefit Plans The Companys Profit Sharing and Savings Plan for U.S.-based employees includes a 401(k) feature, an ESOP feature, and a discretionary employer profit sharing match. The 401(k) feature allows participants to make pretax contributions that are partly matched from shares released under the ESOP. The Profit Sharing and Savings Plan also provides for a discretionary employer profit sharing match after the end of the year for those participants eligible to share in the match who have contributed to the 401(k) feature. All current account balances and future contributions and related earnings can be invested in several investment alternatives as well as McDonalds common stock in accordance with each participants elections. Participants future contributions to the 401(k) feature and the discretionary employer matching contribution feature are limited to 20% investment in McDonalds common stock. Participants may choose to make separate investment choices for current account balances and for future contributions. The Company also maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan because of Internal Revenue Service limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities were $439.3 million at December 31, 2010, and $397.3 million at December 31, 2009, and were primarily included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheet. The Company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of the liabilities. At December 31, 2010, derivatives with a fair value of $104.4 million indexed to the Companys stock were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and an investment totaling $92.7 million indexed to certain market indices was included in miscellaneous other assets on the Consolidated balance sheet. All changes in liabilities for these nonqualified plans and in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in selling, general  administrative expenses. Changes in fair value of the derivatives indexed to the Companys stock are recorded in the income statement because the contracts provide the counterparty with a choice to settle in cash or shares. Total U.S. costs for the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan, including nonqualified benefits and related hedging activities, were (in millions): 2010$51.4; 2009$51.3; 2008$61.2. Certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. also offer profit sharing, stock purchase or other similar benefit plans. Total plan costs outside the U.S. were (in millions): 2010$57.6; 2009$45.2; 2008$55.4.

The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: ##TABLE_START  I. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  II. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  III. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ##TABLE_END There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may vary over time. Management assessed the design and effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework. Based on managements assessment using those criteria, as of December 31, 2010, management believes that the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. Ernst  Young, LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 and the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. Their reports are presented on the following pages. The independent registered public accountants and internal auditors advise management of the results of their audits, and make recommendations to improve the system of internal controls. Management evaluates the audit recommendations and takes appropriate action. McDONALDS CORPORATION February 25, 2011  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonalds Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McDonalds Corporation as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of McDonalds Corporation at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), McDonalds Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. ERNST  YOUNG LLP Chicago, Illinois February 25, 2011  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonalds Corporation We have audited McDonalds Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). McDonalds Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report on Managements Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, McDonalds Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of McDonalds Corporation as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Companys management, including the CEO and CFO, confirm that there was no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

Business McDonalds Corporation, the registrant, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to herein as the Company. a. General development of business During 2011, there have been no material changes to the Companys corporate structure or in its method of conducting business. In 2011, the Company has continued the process it began in 2005 to realign certain subsidiaries to develop a corporate structure within its geographic segments that better reflects the operation of the McDonalds worldwide business. b. Financial information about segments Segment data for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 are included in Part II, Item 8, page 40 of this Form 10-K. c. Narrative description of business ##TABLE_START   General ##TABLE_END The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants in the global restaurant industry. These restaurants serve a broad menu (see Products) at various price points providing value in 119 countries around the world. All restaurants are operated either by the Company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchise arrangements, and developmental licensees and foreign affiliated markets under license agreements. The Companys operations are designed to assure consistency and high quality at every restaurant. When granting franchises or licenses, the Company is selective and generally is not in the practice of franchising to passive investors. Under the conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and dcor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. A discussion regarding site selection is included in Part I, Item 2, page 6 of this Form 10-K. Conventional franchisees contribute to the Companys revenue stream through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees received upon the opening of a new restaurant or the granting of a new franchise term. The conventional franchise arrangement typically lasts 20 years, and franchising practices are generally consistent throughout the world. Over 70% of franchised restaurants operate under conventional franchise arrangements. Under a developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest. While the Company has no capital invested, it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales, as well as initial fees. The largest of these developmental license arrangements operates over 1,800 restaurants across 19 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Company has an equity investment in a limited number of foreign affiliated markets, referred to as affiliates. The largest of these affiliates is Japan, where there are approximately 3,300 restaurants. The Company receives a royalty based on a percent of sales in these markets and records its share of net results in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. The Company and its franchisees purchase food, packaging, equipment and other goods from numerous independent suppliers. The Company has established and strictly enforces high quality standards and product specifications. The Company has quality centers around the world to ensure that its high standards are consistently met. The quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews, but also on-site supplier visits. A quality leadership board, composed of the Companys technical, safety and supply chain specialists, provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food quality and safety. In addition, the Company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation, assure best practices and drive continuous improvement. Leveraging scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies, the Company also collaborates with suppliers toward a goal of achieving competitive, predictable food and paper costs over the long term. Independently owned and operated distribution centers, approved by the Company, distribute products and supplies to most McDonalds restaurants. In addition, restaurant personnel are trained in the proper storage, handling and preparation of products and in the delivery of customer service. McDonalds global brand is well known. Marketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed to promote McDonalds brand image and differentiate the Company from competitors. Marketing and promotional efforts focus on value, food taste, menu choice, nutrition, convenience and the customer experience. The Company continuously endeavors to improve its social responsibility and environmental practices to achieve long-term sustainability, which benefits McDonalds and the communities it serves. ##TABLE_START   Products ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu, although there are geographic variations to suit local consumer preferences and tastes. In addition, McDonalds tests new products on an ongoing basis. McDonalds menu includes hamburgers and cheeseburgers, Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Filet-O-Fish, several chicken sandwiches, Chicken McNuggets, Snack Wraps, french fries, salads, oatmeal, shakes, McFlurry desserts, sundaes, soft serve cones, pies, soft drinks, coffee, McCaf beverages and other beverages. In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of other products during limited-time promotions. McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. and many international markets offer a full or limited breakfast menu. Breakfast offerings may include Egg McMuffin, Sausage McMuffin with Egg, McGriddles, biscuit and bagel sandwiches and hotcakes. ##TABLE_START   Intellectual property ##TABLE_END The Company owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information. The Company considers the trademarks McDonalds and The Golden Arches Logo to be of material importance to its business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid  McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 1 as long as they are used and/or registered. Patents, copyrights and licenses are of varying remaining durations. ##TABLE_START   Seasonal operations ##TABLE_END The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree. ##TABLE_START   Working capital practices ##TABLE_END Information about the Companys working capital practices is incorporated herein by reference to Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 in Part II, Item 7, pages 10 through 26, and the Consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 in Part II, Item 8, page 29 of this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START   Customers ##TABLE_END The Companys business is not dependent upon either a single customer or small group of customers. ##TABLE_START   Backlog ##TABLE_END Company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders. ##TABLE_START   Government contracts ##TABLE_END No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government. ##TABLE_START   Competition ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of food products. The Company competes on the basis of price, convenience, service, menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry. In measuring the Companys competitive position, management reviews data compiled by Euromonitor International, a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry. The Companys primary competition, which management refers to as the Informal Eating Out (IEO) segment, includes the following restaurant categories defined by Euromonitor International: quick-service eating establishments, casual dining full-service restaurants, 100% home delivery/takeaway providers, street stalls or kiosks, specialist coffee shops, juice/smoothie bars and self-service cafeterias. The IEO segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and full-service restaurants other than casual dining. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the global IEO segment was composed of approximately 6.5 million outlets and generated $933 billion in annual sales in 2010, the most recent year for which data is available. McDonalds Systemwide 2010 restaurant business accounted for approximately 0.5% of those outlets and about 8% of the sales. Management also on occasion benchmarks McDonalds against the entire restaurant industry, including the IEO segment defined above and all other full-service restaurants. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 13.7 million outlets and generated about $1.86 trillion in annual sales in 2010. McDonalds Systemwide restaurant business accounted for approximately 0.2% of those outlets and about 4% of the sales. ##TABLE_START   Research and development ##TABLE_END The Company operates research and development facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. While research and development activities are important to the Companys business, these expenditures are not material. Independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System). ##TABLE_START   Environmental matters ##TABLE_END Increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives, particularly in the area of climate change. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. Although the impact would likely vary by world region and/or market, we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs, including for the Company, its franchisees and suppliers. Also, there is a possibility that governmental initiatives, or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns or climate, could have a direct impact on the operations of our restaurants or the operations of our suppliers in ways which we cannot predict at this time. The Company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner. At this time, the Company has already begun to undertake its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment, including the development of means to monitor and reduce energy use, in many of its markets. ##TABLE_START   Number of employees ##TABLE_END The Companys number of employees worldwide, including Company-operated restaurant employees, was approximately 420,000 as of year-end 2011. d. Financial information about geographic areas Financial information about geographic areas is incorporated herein by reference to Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in Part II, Item 7, pages 10 through 26 and Segment and geographic information in Part II, Item 8, page 40 of this Form 10-K. e.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements The information on this report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook for 2012. These statements use such words as may, will, expect, believe and plan. They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements. Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. The most important of these is whether we can remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment. The IEO segment of the restaurant industry, although largely mature in our major markets, is highly fragmented and competitive. The IEO segment has been contracting in many markets, including some major markets, due to unfavorable economic conditions, and this may continue. Persistently high unemployment rates in many markets have also increased consumer focus on value and heightened pricing sensitivity. Combined with increasing pressure on commodity and labor costs, these circumstances affect restaurant sales and margin growth despite the strength of our brand and value proposition. We have the added challenge of the cultural, economic and regulatory differences that exist within and among the more than 100 countries where we operate. Initiatives we undertake may not have universal appeal among different segments of our customer base and can drive unanticipated changes in guest counts and customer perceptions. Our operations, plans and results are also affected by regulatory and similar initiatives around the world, notably the focus on nutritional content and the production, processing and preparation of food from field to front counter, as well as industry marketing practices. These risks can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance. Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales and profits depends largely on how well we execute the Plan to Win. The Plan to Win addresses the key drivers of our business and resultspeople, products, place, price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following: ##TABLE_START   Our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to trends or other factors that affect the IEO segment and our competitive position in the diverse markets we serve, such as spending patterns, demographic changes, trends in food preparation, consumer preferences and publicity about us, all of which can drive popular perceptions of our business or affect the willingness of other companies to enter into site, supply or other arrangements or alliances with us; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The risks associated with our franchise business model, including whether our franchisees and developmental licensees will have the experience and financial resources to be effective operators and remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and capital-intensive initiatives and the potential impact on us if they experience food safety or other operational problems or project a brand image inconsistent with our values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited by local law or otherwise, costly to exercise or subject to litigation; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our ability to drive restaurant improvements that achieve optimal capacity, particularly during peak mealtime hours, and to motivate our restaurant personnel and our franchisees to achieve consistency and high service levels so as to improve consumer perceptions of our ability to meet expectations for quality food served in clean and friendly environments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Whether our restaurant reimaging and rebuilding plans, which remain a priority, are targeted at the elements of the restaurant experience that will best accomplish our goals and whether we can complete our plans as and when projected; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The costs and operational risks associated with our increasing reliance on information technology (including our point-of-sale and other in-store technology systems or platforms), including the risk that we will not realize fully the benefits of our investments in technology, which we are accelerating, as well as the potential for system failures, programming errors or breaches of security involving our systems or those of third-party operators of our systems; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The success of our initiatives to support menu choice, physical activity and nutritional awareness and to address these and other matters of social responsibility in a way that communicates our values effectively and inspires trust and confidence; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our ability to respond effectively to adverse perceptions about the quick-service category of the IEO segment or about our products (including their nutritional content), promotions and premiums, such as Happy Meals (collectively, our products), how we source the commodities we use, and our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonalds of food-borne illnesses or product safety issues; ##TABLE_END McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 3 ##TABLE_START   The impact of social media and other mobile communications or photo applications that can be used to promote adverse perceptions of our operations or those of our suppliers, or to promote or threaten boycotts or other actions involving us or our suppliers, with significantly greater speed and scope than traditional media outlets; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The success of our tiered approach to menu offerings and our ability to introduce new offerings, as well as the impact of our competitors actions, including in response to our menu changes, and our ability to continue robust menu development and manage the complexity of our restaurant operations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our ability to differentiate the McDonalds experience in a way that balances consumer value with margin expansion, particularly in markets where pricing or cost pressures are significant or have been exacerbated by the current challenging economic and operating environment; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of pricing, marketing and promotional plans on sales and margins and our ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly to changing economic conditions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of events such as boycotts or protests, labor strikes and supply chain interruptions (including due to lack of supply or price increases) that can adversely affect us directly or adversely affect the vendors, franchisees and others that are also part of the McDonalds System and whose performance has a material impact on our results; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our ability to recruit and retain qualified local personnel to manage our operations and growth, particularly in certain developing markets; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our ability to leverage promotional or operating successes in individual markets into other markets in a timely and cost-effective way. ##TABLE_END Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, which can adversely affect our sales, margins and net income. Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions, but also by local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market or daypart (e.g., breakfast). To mitigate the impact of these conditions, we may take promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins, limit our operating flexibility or result in charges or restaurant closings. Some macroeconomic conditions have an even more wide-ranging and prolonged impact. The current environment has been characterized by weak economies, persistently high unemployment rates, inflationary pressures and extreme volatility in financial markets worldwide, which has been exacerbated by the significant uncertainty associated with the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in certain Eurozone countries. This environment has adversely affected both business and consumer confidence and spending, and uncertainty about the long-term investment environment could further depress capital investment and economic activity. These unfavorable conditions are expected to persist for the foreseeable future in many of our most important markets. The key factors that can affect our operations, plans and results in this environment are the following: ##TABLE_START   Whether our strategies will be effective in enabling the continued market share gains that we have included in our plans, while at the same time enabling us to achieve our targeted ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   operating income growth, despite the uncertain economic outlook, resurgent competitors and a more costly and competitive advertising environment; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient product supply on favorable terms; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact on consumer disposable income levels and spending habits of governmental actions to manage national economic matters, whether through austerity or stimulus measures and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact on restaurant sales and margins of recent volatility in commodity and gasoline prices, which we expect will continue and may be exacerbated by current events in the Middle East, and the impact of pricing, hedging and other actions that we, franchisees and suppliers may take to address this environment; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor-intensive business model, the long-term trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets and any potential impact of union organizing efforts; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of foreign exchange and interest rates on our financial condition and results; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Whether we are able to identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants from year to year, and whether new sites are as profitable as expected; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest, all of which are exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment charges that reduce our earnings; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of changes in our debt levels on our credit ratings, interest expense, availability of acceptable counterparties, ability to obtain funding on favorable terms or our operating or financial flexibility, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants. ##TABLE_END Increasing legal and regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following: ##TABLE_START   The cost, compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face, especially in the United States where inconsistent standards ##TABLE_END 4 McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 ##TABLE_START   imposed by local, state and federal authorities can adversely affect popular perceptions of our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of new, potential or changing regulation that can affect our business plans, such as those relating to marketing and the content and safety of our food and other products, as well as the risks and costs of our labeling and other disclosure practices, particularly given varying legal requirements and practices for testing and disclosure within our industry, ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants, and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of nutritional, health and other scientific inquiries and conclusions, which constantly evolve and often have contradictory implications, but nonetheless drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation, including taxation, in ways that could be material to our business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities and non-governmental organizations on environmental matters, such as environmental sustainability, climate change, greenhouse gases and water consumption, including initiatives that effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of litigation trends, particularly in our major markets, including class actions, labor and employment claims, landlord/tenant disputes and intellectual property claims (including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems); the relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings; the cost and other effects of settlements or judgments, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products; and the scope and terms of insurance or indemnification protections that we may have; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The increasing costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and overseas regulations affecting our workforce and labor practices, including regulations relating to wage and hour practices, immigration, healthcare, retirement and other employee benefits and unlawful workplace discrimination; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Disruptions in our operations or price volatility in a market that can result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or import-export controls, increased tariffs or government-mandated closure of our or our vendors operations, and the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or proceedings, whether or not they have merit; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The legal and compliance risks associated with information technology, such as the costs of compliance with privacy, consumer protection and other laws, the potential costs associated with alleged security breaches (including the loss of consumer confidence that may result and the risk of criminal penalties or civil liability to consumers or employees whose ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   data is alleged to have been collected or used inappropriately) and potential challenges to the associated intellectual property rights or to our use of that intellectual property; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, changes in tax accounting or tax laws (or related authoritative interpretations), particularly if corporate tax reform becomes a key component of budgetary initiatives in the United States and elsewhere, and the impact of settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the IRS or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. ##TABLE_END The trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors. Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these, some of which are outside our control, are the following: ##TABLE_START   The continuing unfavorable global economic and extremely volatile market conditions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the United States which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Changes in financial or tax reporting and accounting principles or practices that materially affect our reported financial condition and results and investor perceptions of our performance; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can reflect market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete in some cases) or expectations about our business, our creditworthiness or investor confidence generally; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonalds may be included, such as the SP 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact of our stock repurchase program or dividend rate; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The impact on our results of other corporate actions, such as those we may take from time to time as part of our continuous review of our corporate structure in light of business, legal and tax considerations. ##TABLE_END Our results and prospects can be adversely affected by events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others. Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels or other factors that affect our results and  McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 5 prospects, such as commodity costs. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. ", "2": " ITEM 2. Properties The Company owns and leases real estate primarily in connection with its restaurant business. The Company identifies and develops sites that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential to the Company. To assess potential, the Company analyzes traffic and walking patterns, census data and other relevant data. The Companys experience and access to advanced technology aid in evaluating this information. The Company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for restaurant sites, which ensures long-term occupancy rights and helps control related costs. Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to control average development costs through construction and design efficiencies, standardization and by leveraging the Companys global sourcing network. Additional information about the Companys properties is included in Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in Part II, Item 7, pages 10 through 26 and in Financial statements and supplementary data in Part II, Item 8, pages 26 through 43 of this Form 10-K.

While the Company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, unfavorable rulings could occur. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on net income for the period in which the ruling occurs or for future periods. ##TABLE_START   Franchising ##TABLE_END A substantial number of McDonalds restaurants are franchised to independent entrepreneurs operating under contractual arrangements with the Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company and its franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects including, but not limited to, quality, service and cleanliness issues, contentions regarding grants or terminations of franchises, delinquent payments of rents and fees, and franchisee claims for additional franchises or rewrites of franchises. Additionally, occasional disputes arise between the Company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a McDonalds franchise. ##TABLE_START   Suppliers ##TABLE_END The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries do not supply food, paper or related items to any McDonalds restaurants. The Company relies upon numerous independent suppliers that are required to meet and maintain the Companys high standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company and its suppliers which include, by way of example, compliance with product specifications and the Companys business relationship with suppliers. In addition, disputes occasionally arise on a number of issues between the Company and individuals or entities who claim that they should be (or should have been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the Companys restaurants. ##TABLE_START   Employees ##TABLE_END Hundreds of thousands of people are employed by the Company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, thousands of people from time to time seek employment in such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes arise regarding hiring, firing, promotion and pay practices, including wage and hour disputes, alleged discrimination and compliance with employment laws. ##TABLE_START   Customers ##TABLE_END Restaurants owned by subsidiaries of the Company regularly serve a broad segment of the public. In so doing, disputes arise as to products, service, incidents, advertising, nutritional and other disclosures, as well as other matters common to an extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company. ##TABLE_START   Intellectual Property ##TABLE_END The Company has registered trademarks and service marks, patents and copyrights, some of which are of material importance to the Companys business.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants. Of the 33,510 restaurants in 119 countries at year-end 2011, 27,075 were franchised or licensed (including 19,527 franchised to conventional franchisees, 3,929 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,619 licensed to foreign affiliates (affiliates)primarily Japan) and 6,435 were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and dcor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate and/or franchise restaurants within a market. We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. However, directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In our Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. We continually review, and as appropriate adjust, our mix of Company-operated and franchised (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and foreign affiliated) restaurants to help optimize overall performance. The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (U.S.), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA). In addition, throughout this report we present Other Countries  Corporate that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 32%, 40% and 22% of total revenues, respectively. The United Kingdom (U.K.), France and Germany, collectively, account for over 50% of Europes revenues; and China, Australia and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for over 55% of APMEAs revenues. These six markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise approximately 70% of total revenues. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth and returns. ##TABLE_START   Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because we believe this better represents the Companys underlying business trends. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Companys initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Growth in comparable sales is driven by guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Generally, the goal is to achieve a balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. ##TABLE_END McDonalds reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal. ##TABLE_START   Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Companys financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the adjusted cash used for investing activities ##TABLE_END 10 McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 ##TABLE_START   (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. ##TABLE_END STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The strength of the alignment between the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System) has been key to McDonalds success. This business model enables McDonalds to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve. In addition, it facilitates our ability to identify, implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers changing needs and preferences. McDonalds customer-focused Plan to Winwhich concentrates on being better, not just biggerprovides a common framework for our global business while allowing for local adaptation. Through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five elements of our Plan to WinPeople, Products, Place, Price and Promotionwe have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown comparable sales and customer visits in each of the last eight years. This Plan, combined with financial discipline, has delivered strong results for our shareholders. We have exceeded our long-term, constant currency financial targets of average annual Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%; average annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%; and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the Plans implementation in 2003, after adjusting for the loss in 2007 from the Latin America developmental license transaction. Given the size and scope of our global business, we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable over time, keeping us focused on making the best decisions for the long-term benefit of our System. In 2011, we remained focused on customers needs and accelerated efforts within the Plan to Win where the greatest opportunity exists. The Companys key global priorities of optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening accessibility to our Brand represent areas where we are intensifying our efforts to drive the business further. Initiatives supporting these priorities resonated with consumers, driving increases in sales and customer visits despite challenging economies and a contracting Informal Eating Out (IEO) segment in many markets. As a result, every area of the world contributed to 2011 global comparable sales and guest counts increasing 5.6% and 3.7%, respectively. Specific menu pricing actions across our system reflect local market conditions as well as other factors, notably the food away from home and food at home inflation indices. In our Company-operated restaurants, we manage menu board prices to ensure value at all price points, increase profitability and mitigate inflation, all while trying to maintain guest count momentum. In order to accomplish these objectives, we utilize a strategic pricing tool that balances price, product mix and promotion. Franchisees also have access to, and many utilize, this strategic pricing tool. In general, we believe franchisees employ a similar pricing strategy. In 2011, we increased average price at Company-operated restaurants in each area of the world, although increases varied by market and region. We look to optimize product mix by utilizing a menu with entry-point value, core, premium and fourth-tier offerings. We also introduce new products that meet customer needs, which can expand average check and increase guest counts. In the U.S., we grew sales, guest counts and market share with comparable sales up for the ninth consecutive year, rising 4.8% in 2011, while comparable guest counts rose 3.3%. These results were achieved despite a slight decline in the IEO segment. We remained focused on maximizing our core business while providing customers with affordable products and value throughout our menu including options available on the Dollar Menu at breakfast and the rest of the day. We highlighted core menu items like Chicken McNuggets that featured new sauces, breakfast products including our new Fruit  Maple Oatmeal, additions to the McCaf beverage line and limited-time offerings such as the McRib sandwich. The national launch of the McCaf Frozen Strawberry Lemonade and Mango Pineapple real-fruit smoothie provided meaningful extensions to the McCaf beverage line. Convenient locations also continued to provide a competitive advantage with extended hours and efficient drive-thru service. Modernizing the customer experience remained a focus with the expansion of our major remodeling program to enhance the appearance and functionality of our restaurants and make our restaurants more relevant to our customers daily lives. Over 900 existing restaurants were remodeled during 2011 with the majority adding drive-thru capacity to capture additional guest counts. We also completed our two-year, Systemwide roll-out of a new point-of-sale system. This allows us to continue expanding our menu offerings while making it easier for our crew to fulfill every order accurately. In Europe, comparable sales rose 5.9%, marking the eighth consecutive year of comparable sales increases, and comparable guest counts rose 3.4%. Major contributors were the U.K., France, Russia and Germany. Initiatives that helped drive our business included leveraging our tiered menu featuring everyday affordable prices, menu variety including new and limited-time offerings, and reimaging over 900 restaurants. We continue to expand our coffee business and have over 1,500 McCaf locations, which in Europe are generally separate areas inside the restaurants that serve specialty coffees, indulgent desserts and snacks. We completed the rollout of the new drive-thru customer order display system in over 4,500 restaurants. In addition, we increased our accessibility and convenience with extended operating hours. We offered new premium menu items such as the 1955 burger and expanded McWraps across several European markets. In many markets, we have continued to offer a fourth-tier platformsuch as Little Tasters in the U.K.a range of tasty and appealing items in smaller portion sizes. Finally, we continued building customer trust in our brand through communications that emphasized the quality and origin of McDonalds food and our commitment to sustainable business practices. In APMEA, our momentum continued with nearly every country delivering positive comparable sales, led by China and Australia. Comparable sales rose 4.7% and comparable guest counts rose 4.3% with performance driven by strategies emphasizing value, breakfast, convenience, core menu extensions, desserts and promotional food events. Australia launched a Value Lunch program that features meals at discounted price points for certain hours while China and Japan concentrated on affordability by continuing their Value Lunch platforms. New menu items such as real-fruit smoothies and frapps in Australia and the extension of the Value Breakfast program in China were popular with customers. Japan executed another successful U.S. themed burger promotion and celebrated its 40 th anniversary by offering popular core menu items at reduced prices. Desserts  McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 11 continue to play a meaningful role as we seek to deliver on customers menu expectations through products such as the McFlurry and unique delivery storefronts like the dessert kiosks in China, where we are now one of the largest ice cream retailers. Our breakfast business continues to evolve and is now offered in approximately 75% of APMEA restaurants. In Japan, rotational breakfast items, including the Chicken Muffin and Tuna Muffin, were offered during several months, while Australia launched new breakfast menu items such as bagel sandwiches. Nearly two-thirds of APMEA restaurants are now offering some form of extended operating hours and over 4,600 restaurants are open 24 hours. Delivery is offered in many APMEA markets and is now available in over 1,500 restaurants, including nearly 500 in China. McDonalds Japan was negatively impacted by the natural disaster last March and as a result, continued to face some challenges throughout 2011. However, we remain confident that the market will continue to drive long-term profitable growth. Our approach to offering affordable value to our customers is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and effectively managing restaurant-level food and paper costs by leveraging our scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management practices. Our ability to execute our strategies in every area of the world, grow comparable sales and control selling, general  administrative expenses resulted in combined operating margin (operating income as a percent of total revenues) of 31.6% in 2011, an improvement of 0.6 percentage points over 2010. In 2011, strong global sales and margin performance grew cash from operations, which rose $808 million to $7.2 billion. Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us flexibility to fund capital expenditures and debt repayments as well as return cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures of approximately $2.7 billion were invested in our business primarily to open new restaurants and reimage existing restaurants. Across the System, 1,150 restaurants were opened and over 2,500 existing locations were reimaged. In addition, we returned $6.0 billion to shareholders consisting of $3.4 billion in share repurchases and $2.6 billion in dividends. Cash from operations continues to benefit from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owner/operators is a very stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs. In addition, the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the Company-owned model. We believe locally-owned and operated restaurants maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantages, making McDonalds not just a global brand but also a locally-relevant one. HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE YEAR INCLUDED: ##TABLE_START   Comparable sales grew 5.6% and guest counts rose 3.7%, building on 2010 increases of 5.0% and 4.9%, respectively. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Revenues increased 12% (8% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Operating income increased 14% (10% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Combined operating margin increased 0.6 percentage points to 31.6%. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Diluted earnings per share was $5.27, an increase of 15% (11% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Cash provided by operations increased $808 million to $7.2 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   One-year ROIIC was 37.6% and three-year ROIIC was 37.8% for the period ended December 31, 2011 (see reconciliation on page 25). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 15% to $0.70 for the fourth quarterbringing our current annual dividend to $2.80 per share. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The Company returned $6.0 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends paid. ##TABLE_END OUTLOOK FOR 2012 We will continue to drive success in 2012 and beyond by enhancing the customer experience across all elements of our Plan to Win. Our global System continues to be energized by our ongoing momentum and significant growth opportunities. We hold a strong competitive position in the market place, and we intend to further differentiate our brand by striving to become our customers favorite place and way to eat and drink. Growing market share will continue to be a focus as we execute our three global priorities: optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening our accessibility. The menu efforts will include expanding destination beverages and desserts and enhancing our food image. The customer experience efforts will include accelerating our interior and exterior reimaging efforts and providing our restaurant teams with the appropriate tools, training, technology and staffing. The accessibility efforts will include increasing the level and variety of conveniences provided to our customers through greater proximity, extended operating hours and stronger value platforms. We will execute these priorities to increase McDonalds brand relevance with operational and financial discipline. Consequently, we are confident we can again meet or exceed our long-term constant currency financial targets. In the U.S., our 2012 initiatives focus on balancing core menu classics with new products and promotional food events such as Chicken McBites, made with bite-sized pieces of premium chicken breast, Blueberry Banana Nut Oatmeal, and additional McCaf beverage offerings such as the Cherry Berry Chiller. We will continue offering value across the menu at breakfast and the rest of the day. Opportunities around additional staffing at peak hours during the breakfast and lunch day parts and increasing restaurants that operate 24 hours per day will allow us to broaden accessibility to our customers. In addition, our plans to elevate the brand experience include leveraging our new point-of-sale system with other technology enhancements such as using hand-held order takers and advancements to improve our front counter service system. We also will expand our major remodel program to another 800 locations in 2012. Our business plans in Europe are focused on building market share with the right mix of guest counts, average check, strategic restaurant reimaging and expansion. We will increase our local relevance by complementing our tiered menu with a variety of promotional food events as well as new snack and dessert options. In 2012, we will reimage approximately 900 restaurants as we progress towards our goal of having 90% of our interiors and over 65% of our exteriors reimaged by the end of the year. We will leverage service innovations by continuing the deployment of technologies such as updating the point-of-sale system, self-order kiosks and hand-held order devices to enhance the customer experience and help drive increased transactions and  12 McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 labor efficiency. We will also continue working to reduce our impact on the environment with energy management tools that enable us to use green energy in markets where available. In addition, the U.K. will be the proud host of our Olympic sponsorship, marking the ninth consecutive time that McDonalds will serve as the Official Restaurant of the Olympic Games. In 2012, our European business will continue to face headwinds due to economic uncertainty and additional government-initiated austerity measures implemented in many countries. While we will closely monitor consumer reactions to these measures, we remain confident that our business model will continue to drive profitable growth. In APMEA, we will continue our efforts to become our customers first choice for eating out by continuing to provide robust value platforms and focusing on menu variety, restaurant experience and convenience. Value will continue to be a key growth driver as we reinforce the affordability of our menu to consumers across all dayparts, by building on our successful Value Lunch platforms and expanding our breakfast offerings. The markets will continue to execute against a combination of core menu items, promotional food events, desserts and limited-time offerings to provide a balanced mix of products to our customers. We will grow our business by opening approximately 750 new restaurants and reimaging about 475 existing restaurants while elevating our focus on service and operations to drive efficiencies. In China, we will continue to build a foundation for long-term growth by opening 225 to 250 restaurants in 2012 toward our goal of reaching 2,000 restaurants by the end of 2013. Convenience initiatives will focus on expanding delivery service across the region and building on the success of our extended operating hours. We continue to maintain strong financial discipline by effectively managing spending in order to maximize financial performance. In making capital allocation decisions, our goal is to make investments that elevate the McDonalds experience and drive sustainable growth in sales and market share while earning strong returns. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) to shareholders over the long-term via dividends and share repurchases. McDonalds does not provide specific guidance on diluted earnings per share. The following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Companys results: ##TABLE_START   Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 2 percentage points to 2012 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to about 870 net traditional restaurants added in 2011. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START   The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would increase annual diluted earnings per share by about 3-4 cents. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   With about 75% of McDonalds grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Companys commodity costs. For the full year 2012, the total basket of goods cost is expected to increase 4.5-5.5% in the U.S. and 2.5-3.5% in Europe, with more pressure expected in the first half. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The Company expects full-year 2012 selling, general  administrative expenses to increase about 6% in constant currencies, driven by certain technology investments, primarily to accelerate future restaurant capabilities, and costs related to the 2012 Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention and Olympics. The Company expects the magnitude of the increase to be confined to 2012. Fluctuations will be experienced between quarters due to the timing of certain items such as the Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention and the Olympics. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2012 to increase approximately 6-8% compared with 2011. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   A significant part of the Companys operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 65% of the Companys operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Companys annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 24 cents. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2012 to be 31% to 33%. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The Company expects capital expenditures for 2012 to be approximately $2.9 billion. About half of this amount will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open more than 1,300 restaurants including about 450 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets, such as Japan and Latin America, where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of about 900 restaurants. The remaining capital will be used for reinvestment in existing restaurants. Nearly half of this reinvestment will be used to reimage more than 2,400 locations worldwide, some of which will require no capital investment from the Company. ##TABLE_END McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 13 Consolidated Operating Results Operating results ##TABLE_START       2011         2010     2009  Dollars in millions, except per share data  Amount   Increase/ (decrease)      Amount   Increase/ (decrease)      Amount  Revenues        Sales by Company-operated restaurants  $ 18,293    13 %   $ 16,233    5 %   $ 15,459  Revenues from franchised restaurants   8,713    11      7,842    8      7,286  Total revenues   27,006    12      24,075    6      22,745  Operating costs and expenses        Company-operated restaurant expenses   14,838    14     13,060    3     12,651  Franchised restaurants-occupancy expenses   1,481    8     1,378    6     1,302  Selling, general  administrative expenses   2,394    3     2,333    4     2,234  Impairment and other charges (credits), net   (4 )   nm     29    nm     (61 ) Other operating (income) expense, net   (233 )   (18 )     (198 )   11      (222 ) Total operating costs and expenses   18,476    11      16,602    4      15,904  Operating income   8,530    14     7,473    9     6,841  Interest expense   493    9     451    (5 )    473  Nonoperating (income) expense, net   25    13     22    nm     (24 ) Gain on sale of investment                 nm      (95 ) Income before provision for income taxes   8,012    14      7,000    8      6,487  Provision for income taxes   2,509    22      2,054    6      1,936  Net income  $ 5,503    11 %    $ 4,946    9 %    $ 4,551  Earnings per common sharediluted  $ 5.27    15 %    $ 4.58    11 %    $ 4.11  Weighted-average common shares outstandingdiluted   1,044.9          1,080.3          1,107.4  ##TABLE_END nm Not meaningful. IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonalds mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2011, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by the stronger Euro and Australian Dollar as well as most other currencies. In 2010, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by stronger global currencies, primarily the Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, partly offset by the weaker Euro. In 2009, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results, primarily caused by the weaker Euro, British Pound, Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar.

Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $0.19 on diluted earnings per share. In 2010, net income and diluted earnings per common share were $4.9 billion and $4.58. Results included after tax charges due to Impairment and other charges (credits), net of $25 million or $0.02 per share, primarily related to the Companys share of restaurant closing costs in McDonalds Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate) in conjunction with the strategic review of the markets restaurant portfolio, partly offset by income related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $0.01 per share on diluted earnings per share. In 2009, net income and diluted earnings per common share were $4.6 billion and $4.11. Results benefited by after tax income due to Impairment and other charges (credits), net of $91 million or $0.08 per share, primarily due to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. Results also benefited by an after tax gain of $59 million or $0.05 per share due to the sale of the Companys minority ownership interest in Redbox, reflected in Gain on sale of investment. Results were negatively impacted by $0.15 per share due to the effect of foreign currency translation. The Company repurchased 41.9 million shares of its stock for $3.4 billion in 2011 and 37.8 million shares of its stock for nearly $2.7 billion in 2010, driving reductions of over 3% and 2% of total shares outstanding, respectively, net of stock option exercises. REVENUES The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. In 2011 and 2010, constant currency revenue growth was driven primarily by positive comparable sales as well as expansion.

New products introduced in 2011 included Fruit  Maple Oatmeal and additions to the McCaf beverage line, while new products introduced in 2010 included McCaf frapps and smoothies as well as the Angus Snack Wraps. Refranchising activity negatively impacted revenue growth in 2010. Europes constant currency increase in revenues in 2011 was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in Russia (which is entirely Company-operated), the U.K., France and Germany, as well as expansion in Russia. The 2010 increase was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in the U.K., France and Russia, as well as expansion in Russia, partly offset by the impact of refranchising activity primarily in the U.K. In APMEA, the constant currency increase in revenues in 2011 was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in China and most other markets. The 2010 increase was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in China, Australia and most other markets. In addition, expansion in China contributed to the increases in both years.

Franchised margin dollars increased $768 million or 12% (9% in constant currencies) in 2011 and $479 million or 8% (8% in constant currencies) in 2010.

In Europe, the franchised margin percent increase in 2011 was primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by  16 McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 higher occupancy costs. Europes franchised margin percent decreased in 2010 as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher occupancy expenses, the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives and the refranchising strategy. In APMEA, the franchised margin percent increase in 2011 was primarily due to a contractual escalation in the royalty rate for Japan in addition to positive comparable sales in most markets, partly offset by a negative impact from the strengthening of the Australian dollar. The 2010 decrease was primarily driven by a negative impact from the strengthening of the Australian dollar. The franchised margin percent in APMEA and Other Countries  Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. ##TABLE_START   Company-operated margins ##TABLE_END Company-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company-operated margin dollars increased $282 million or 9% (5% in constant currencies) in 2011 and increased $366 million or 13% (12% in constant currencies) in 2010. The constant currency growth in Company-operated margin dollars in 2011 was driven by positive comparable sales partially offset by higher costs, primarily commodity costs, in all segments. Positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs were the primary drivers of the constant currency growth in Company-operated margin dollars in 2010.

The margin percent increased in 2010 due to lower commodity costs and positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs. Refranchising also had a positive impact on the margin percent in 2010. Europes Company-operated margin percent decreased in 2011 primarily due to higher commodity, labor, and occupancy costs, partially offset by positive comparable sales. The margin percent increased in 2010 primarily due to positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs, partly offset by higher labor costs. In APMEA, the Company-operated margin percent in 2011 reflected positive comparable sales, offset by higher commodity, labor and occupancy costs. Acceleration of new restaurant openings in China negatively impacted the margin percent. Similar to other markets, new restaurants in China initially open with lower margins that grow significantly over time. The APMEA margin percent increased in 2010 due to positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs, partly offset by higher occupancy  other costs and increased labor costs. Supplemental information regarding Company-operated restaurants We continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve these goals, but as previously stated, Company-operated restaurants are also important to our success. We report results for Company-operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs. We report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general  administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company-operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company-operated restaurants generally include gains/losses on sales of restaurant businesses and write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. We believe the following information about Company-operated restaurants in our most significant segments provides an additional perspective on this business. Management responsible for our Company-operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the Company-operated business on this basis to assess its performance. Management of the Company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix, subject to other relevant considerations. The following table seeks to illustrate the two components of our Company-operated margins. The first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations, which we refer to as Store operating margin. The second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties. We refer to this component as Brand/real estate margin. Both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties, although rent and royalties for Company-operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation. Rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales, and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of McDonalds investment in the restaurant. Royalty rates may also vary by market. As shown in the following table, in disaggregating the components of our Company-operated margins, certain costs with respect to Company-operated restaurants are reflected in Brand/real estate margin. Those costs consist of rent payable by McDonalds to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy  other operating expenses recorded in the Consolidated statement of income. Store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses, and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating Brand/real estate margin. While we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our Company-operated business, it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the Company in accordance with accounting principles  McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 17 generally accepted in the U.S. In particular, as noted previously, we do not allocate selling, general  administrative expenses to our Company-operated business. However, we believe that about $50,000 per restaurant, on average, is the typical cost to support this business in the U.S. The actual costs in markets outside the U.S. will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market. These costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant. ##TABLE_START   U.S.     Europe  Dollars in millions  2011   2010   2009      2011   2010   2009  As reported        Number of Company-operated restaurants at year end   1,552    1,550    1,578     1,985    2,005    2,001  Sales by Company-operated restaurants  $ 4,433   $ 4,229   $ 4,295    $ 7,852   $ 6,932   $ 6,721  Company-operated margin  $ 914   $ 902   $ 832     $ 1,514   $ 1,373   $ 1,240  Store operating margin        Company-operated margin  $ 914   $ 902   $ 832    $ 1,514   $ 1,373   $ 1,240  Plus:        Outside rent expense (1)   56    60    65     242    223    222  Depreciationbuildings  leasehold improvements (1)   69    65    70     118    105    100  Less:        Rent  royalties (2)   (651 )   (619 )   (634 )     (1,598 )   (1,409 )   (1,363 ) Store operating margin  $ 388   $ 408   $ 333     $ 276   $ 292   $ 199  Brand/real estate margin        Rent  royalties (2)  $ 651   $ 619   $ 634    $ 1,598   $ 1,409   $ 1,363  Less:        Outside rent expense (1)   (56 )   (60 )   (65 )    (242 )   (223 )   (222 ) Depreciationbuildings  leasehold improvements (1)   (69 )   (65 )   (70 )     (118 )   (105 )   (100 ) Brand/real estate margin  $ 526   $ 494   $ 499     $ 1,238   $ 1,081   $ 1,041  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Represents certain costs recorded as occupancy  other operating expenses in the Consolidated statement of income  rent payable by McDonalds to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements.

The growth rate for 2011 was flat as higher employee and other costs were offset by lower incentive based compensation and costs in 2010 related to the Vancouver Olympics and the Companys biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention.

In 2009, the Company recorded income of $61 million related primarily to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. The Company also recognized a tax benefit in 2009 in connection with this income, mainly related to the release of a tax valuation allowance.

The Companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. The Company realized lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily as a result of selling fewer Company-operated restaurants to franchisees. ##TABLE_START   Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates ##TABLE_END Unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates, but does not control. The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonalds share of results. For foreign affiliated marketsprimarily Japanresults are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonalds share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. is reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. Results in 2011 reflected a benefit from stronger foreign currencies partly offset by the decline in the number of unconsolidated partnerships in the U.S. Results in 2010 reflected a reduction in the number of unconsolidated partnerships worldwide partly offset by improved operating performance in Japan. ##TABLE_START   Asset dispositions and other expense ##TABLE_END Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for restaurant closings and uncollectible receivables, asset write-offs due to restaurant reinvestment, and other miscellaneous income and expenses.

In the U.S., 2011 and 2010 results increased primarily due to higher combined restaurant margin dollars, primarily franchised margin dollars. In Europe, results for 2011 and 2010 were driven by stronger operating performance in France, the U.K., Russia and Germany. The increases in 2011 and 2010 were driven by higher combined  McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 19 restaurant margin dollars, primarily franchised margin dollars in 2011 and Company-operated margin dollars in 2010. In APMEA, 2011 results increased due to stronger operating results in many markets. Results for 2010 were primarily driven by stronger results in Australia and many other markets. Impairment charges in 2010 positively impacted the constant currency growth rate for 2011 by 4 percentage points and negatively impacted the 2010 growth rate by 4 percentage points. ##TABLE_START   Combined operating margin ##TABLE_END Combined operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. Combined operating margin for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was 31.6%, 31.0% and 30.1%, respectively. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased in 2011 primarily due to higher average debt balances and stronger foreign currencies, partly offset by lower average interest rates. Interest expense decreased in 2010 primarily due to lower average interest rates slightly offset by higher average debt balances.

Other expense primarily consists of miscellaneous nonoperating income and expense items such as amortization of debt issuance costs. GAIN ON SALE OF INVESTMENT In 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox to Coinstar, Inc., the majority owner, for total consideration of $145 million. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $95 million (after tax  $59 million or $0.05 per share). PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the reported effective income tax rates were 31.3%, 29.3% and 29.8%, respectively. In 2011, the effective income tax rate increased due to lower tax benefits related to certain foreign tax credits, partially offset by nonrecurring deferred tax benefits related to certain foreign operations. In 2010, the effective income tax rate decreased due to higher tax benefits related to foreign operations. In 2009, the effective income tax rate benefited by 0.7 percentage points primarily due to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets. ACCOUNTING CHANGES ##TABLE_START   Fair value measurements ##TABLE_END In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an update to Topic 820  Fair Value Measurement of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). This update provides guidance on how fair value accounting should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards and does not extend the use of fair value accounting. The Company will adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2012, as required, and does not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_START   Comprehensive Income ##TABLE_END In June 2011, the FASB issued an update to Topic 220  Comprehensive Income of the ASC. The update is intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in the financial statements. The guidance requires that the Company presents components of comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements and no longer permits the presentation of comprehensive income in the Consolidated statement of shareholders equity. The Company will adopt this new guidance effective January 1, 2012, as required. ##TABLE_START   Variable interest entities and consolidation ##TABLE_END In June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance on variable interest entities and consolidation, codified primarily in the Consolidation Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance modifies the method for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity as well as the methods permitted for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. In addition, this guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and enhanced disclosures related to a companys involvement with a variable interest entity. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2010. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers, and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entities is not appropriate for the periods presented. As a result, the adoption did not have any impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Cash Flows The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $7.2 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.4 billion in 2011, while cash provided by operations totaled $6.3 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.2 billion in 2010. In 2011, cash provided by operations increased $808 million or 13% compared with 2010 primarily due to higher operating results. In 2010, cash provided by operations increased $591 million or 10% compared with 2009 primarily due to higher operating results.  20 McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.6 billion in 2011, an increase of $515 million compared with 2010. This reflects higher capital expenditures, partly offset by higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.1 billion in 2010, an increase of $401 million compared with 2009. This reflects higher capital expenditures and lower proceeds from sales of investments and restaurant businesses. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.5 billion in 2011, an increase of $804 million compared with 2010, primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases, an increase in the common stock dividend, and lower proceeds from stock option exercises, partly offset by higher net debt issuances. Cash used for financing activities totaled $3.7 billion in 2010, a decrease of $692 million compared with 2009, primarily due to higher net debt issuances, higher proceeds from stock option exercises and lower treasury stock purchases, partly offset by an increase in the common stock dividend. As a result of the above activity, the Companys cash and equivalents balance decreased $51 million in 2011 to $2.3 billion, compared with an increase of $591 million in 2010. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In 2011, the Company opened 1,118 traditional restaurants and 32 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 246 traditional restaurants and 131 satellite restaurants. In 2010, the Company opened 957 traditional restaurants and 35 satellite restaurants, and closed 406 traditional restaurants and 327 satellite restaurants. Of these closures, there were over 400 in McDonalds Japan due to the strategic review of the markets restaurant portfolio. The majority of restaurant openings and closings occurred in the major markets in both years. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.

Over 80% of the restaurants at year-end 2011 were franchised. Capital expenditures increased $595 million or 28% in 2011 primarily due to higher reinvestment in existing restaurants and higher investment in new restaurants. Capital expenditures increased $183 million or 9% in 2010 primarily due to higher investment in new restaurants. In both years, capital expenditures reflected the Companys commitment to grow sales at existing restaurants, including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in many markets around the world. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented over 65% of the total in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.

Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $2.7 million in 2011. The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2011 and 2010. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS For the last three years, the Company returned a total of $16.1 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid. Shares repurchased and dividends ##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data  2011   2010   2009  Number of shares repurchased   41.9    37.8    50.3  Shares outstanding at year end   1,021    1,054    1,077  Dividends declared per share  $ 2.53   $ 2.26   $ 2.05  Dollar amount of shares repurchased  $ 3,373   $ 2,648   $ 2,854  Dividends paid   2,610    2,408    2,235  Total returned to shareholders  $ 5,983   $ 5,056   $ 5,089  ##TABLE_END In September 2009, the Companys Board of Directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date. In 2009, 2010 and 2011 combined, approximately 87 million shares have been repurchased for $6.5 billion under this program. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 36 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2011 full year dividend of $2.53 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.61 per share, with an increase to $0.70 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 15% increase in the quarterly dividend  McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 21 equates to a $2.80 per share annual dividend and reflects the Companys confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors. Financial Position and Capital Resources TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS Total assets increased $1.0 billion or 3% in 2011. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $1.4 billion in 2011. Over 75% of total assets were in major markets at year-end 2011. Net property and equipment increased $774 million in 2011 and represented about 70% of total assets at year end. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net property and equipment increased $1.1 billion primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation. Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. ##TABLE_START    2011   2010   2009  Return on average assets   26.0 %   24.7 %   23.4 % Return on average common equity   37.7    35.3    34.0  ##TABLE_END In 2011, 2010, and 2009, return on average assets and return on average common equity benefited from strong global operating results. Operating income, as reported, does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about two percentage points for all years presented. FINANCING AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2011 totaled $12.5 billion, compared with $11.5 billion at December 31, 2010. The net increase in 2011 was primarily due to net issuances of $1.0 billion.

Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Under existing authorization from the Companys Board of Directors, at December 31, 2011, the Company had $1.7 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $1.5 billion available under committed line of credit agreements as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2012 is approximately $964 million of long-term corporate debt. In 2012, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. Consequently, in February 2012, the Company issued $250.0 million of 10-year U.S. Dollar-denominated notes at a coupon rate of 2.625%, and $500.0 million of 30-year U.S. Dollar-denominated notes at a coupon rate of 3.70%. The Company also has $640 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings outstanding at year-end 2011. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $5.0 billion and $4.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Companys restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At  22 McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 December 31, 2011, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position. The Companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures ##TABLE_START In millions of U.S. Dollars  2011   2010  Euro  $ 5,905   $ 5,465  Australian Dollars   2,409    2,075  Canadian Dollars   1,224    1,123  British Pounds Sterling   726    547  Russian Ruble   594    589  ##TABLE_END The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2011 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2011 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Companys borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2011. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details. ##TABLE_START   Contractual cash outflows     Contractual cash inflows  In millions  Operating leases   Debt obligations (1)      Minimum rent under franchise arrangements  2012  $ 1,247   $ 367    $ 2,425  2013   1,167    1,026     2,357  2014   1,075    738     2,273  2015   965    656     2,157  2016   852    2,158     2,037  Thereafter   6,248    7,499      15,949  Total  $ 11,554   $ 12,444     $ 27,198  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) The maturities reflect reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $1.5 billion, as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in November 2016. Debt obligations do not include $56 million of noncash fair value hedging adjustments or $218 million of accrued interest. ##TABLE_END The Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of IRS limitations. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $482 million, and total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $565 million. There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. The amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the Companys financial position. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows. Other Matters CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: ##TABLE_START   Property and equipment ##TABLE_END Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with  McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 23 similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. ##TABLE_START   Share-based compensation ##TABLE_END The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Companys stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. ##TABLE_START   Long-lived assets impairment review ##TABLE_END Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Companys experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Companys estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual country) with goodwill currently at risk of impairment. ##TABLE_START   Litigation accruals ##TABLE_END In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. ##TABLE_START   Income taxes ##TABLE_END The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. In 2010, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its field examination of the Companys U.S. federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. In connection with this examination, the Company received notices of proposed adjustments from the IRS related to certain foreign tax credits of about $400 million, excluding interest and potential penalties. The Company disagrees with the IRS proposed adjustments. The Company has filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office and expects resolution on this issue in 2012. The Company does not believe that the resolution will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows. The Companys 2009 and 2010 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the examination is expected in 2013. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $12.6 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If managements intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICESINFLATION The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. RECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Companys incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period.  24 McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 The denominator is the weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. Adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the Pret A Manger and Redbox transactions. The weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarters investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2011 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2011 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2010 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full year impact on 2011 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2010 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows: One-year ROIIC calculation (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2010   Incremental change  NUMERATOR:    Operating income  $ 8,529.7   $ 7,473.1   $ 1,056.6  Depreciation and amortization   1,415.0    1,276.2    138.8  Currency translation (1)           (331.4 ) Incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 864.0  DENOMINATOR:    Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (2)    $ 2,311.7  Currency translation (1)           (11.3 ) Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 2,300.4  One-year ROIIC (3)           37.6 % ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Represents one-year weighted-average cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the cash used for investing activities for each quarter in the two-year period ended December 31, 2011. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Years ended December 31,     2010   2011  Cash used for investing activities  $ 2,056.0   $ 2,570.9  AS A PERCENT   Quarters ended:   March 31   12.5 %    87.5 % June 30   37.5    62.5  September 30   62.5    37.5  December 31   87.5    12.5  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) The impact of impairment and other charges (credits), net between 2011 and 2010 positively impacted the one-year ROIIC by 3.4 percentage points. ##TABLE_ENDThree-year ROIIC calculation (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  2011   2008   Incremental change  NUMERATOR:    Operating income  $ 8,529.7   $ 6,442.9   $ 2,086.8  Depreciation and amortization   1,415.0    1,207.8    207.2  Currency translation (4)           0.2  Incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 2,294.2  DENOMINATOR:    Weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities (5)    $ 6,026.6  Currency translation (4)           38.1  Weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 6,064.7  Three-year ROIIC (6)           37.8 % ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (5) Represents three-year weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the adjusted cash used for investing activities for each quarter in the four-year period ended December 31, 2011. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Years ended December 31,     2008   2009   2010   2011  Cash used for investing activities  $ 1,624.7   $ 1,655.3   $ 2,056.0   $ 2,570.9  Less: Cash generated from investing activities related to  Pret A Manger transaction   (229.4 )    Redbox transaction       (144.9 )         Adjusted cash used for investing activities  $ 1,854.1   $ 1,800.2   $ 2,056.0   $ 2,570.9  AS A PERCENT     Quarters ended:     March 31   12.5 %   100.0 %   100.0 %   87.5 % June 30   37.5    100.0    100.0    62.5  September 30   62.5    100.0    100.0    37.5  December 31   87.5    100.0    100.0    12.5  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (6) The impact of impairment and other charges (credits), net between 2011 and 2008 positively impacted the three year ROIIC by 1.2 percentage points. ##TABLE_END McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 25 RISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook for 2012.

All restaurants are operated either by the Company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchise arrangements, and foreign affiliates and developmental licensees under license agreements. The following table presents restaurant information by ownership type: ##TABLE_START Restaurants at December 31,  2011   2010   2009  Conventional franchised   19,527    19,279    19,020  Developmental licensed   3,929    3,485    3,160  Foreign affiliated   3,619    3,574    4,036  Franchised   27,075    26,338    26,216  Company-operated   6,435    6,399    6,262  Systemwide restaurants   33,510    32,737    32,478  ##TABLE_END CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily McDonalds Japan) are accounted for by the equity method. In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amendments to the guidance on variable interest entities and consolidation, codified in the Consolidation Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). This guidance modifies the method for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity as well as the methods permitted for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. In addition, this guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and enhanced disclosures related to a companys involvement with a variable interest entity. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2010. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers, and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the variable interest entity consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented. As a result, the adoption did not have any impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and foreign affiliates. Sales by Company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis. The Company presents sales net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and may include initial fees. Continuing rent and royalties are recognized in the period earned. Initial fees are recognized upon opening of a restaurant or granting of a new franchise term, which is when the Company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise arrangement. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Generally, the functional currency of operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency. ADVERTISING COSTS Advertising costs included in operating expenses of Company-operated restaurants primarily consist of contributions to advertising cooperatives and were (in millions): 2011$768.6; 2010$687.0; 2009$650.8. Production costs for radio and television advertising are expensed when the commercials are initially aired. These production costs, primarily in the U.S., as well as other marketing-related expenses included in selling, general  administrative expenses were (in millions): 2011$74.4; 2010$94.5; 2009$94.7. In addition, significant advertising costs are incurred by franchisees through contributions to advertising cooperatives in individual markets. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Share-based compensation includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value. Share-based compensation expense and the effect on diluted earnings per common share were as follows: ##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data  2011   2010   2009  Share-based compensation expense  $ 86.2   $ 83.1   $ 112.9  After tax  $ 59.2   $ 56.2   $ 76.1  Earnings per common share-diluted  $ 0.05   $ 0.05   $ 0.07  ##TABLE_END Compensation expense related to share-based awards is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in selling, general  administrative expenses in the Consolidated statement of income. As of December 31, 2011, there was $84.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for the 2011, 2010 and 2009 stock option grants. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical trends. Expected stock price volatility is generally based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock for a period approximating the expected life. The expected dividend yield is based on the Companys most recent annual dividend payout. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life.

GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurant businesses. The Companys goodwill primarily results from purchases of McDonalds restaurants from franchisees and ownership increases in subsidiaries or affiliates, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit (defined as each individual country). The Company conducts goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever an indicator of impairment exists. If an indicator of impairment exists (e.g., estimated earnings multiple value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value), the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit, generally based on discounted future cash flows, with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill and the carrying amount of goodwill. Historically, goodwill impairment has not significantly impacted the consolidated financial statements. The following table presents the 2011 activity in goodwill by segment: ##TABLE_START In millions  U.S.   Europe   APMEA (1)   Other Countries  Corporate (2)   Consolidated  Balance at December 31, 2010  $ 1,212.0   $ 785.5   $ 385.0   $ 203.6   $ 2,586.1  Net restaurant purchases (sales)   37.3    37.1    29.8    (4.6 )   99.6  Ownership changes and other   5.1     (7.7 )   (3.0 )   (5.6 ) Currency translation       (21.0 )   (1.7 )   (4.2 )   (26.9 ) Balance at December 31, 2011  $ 1,254.4   $ 801.6   $ 405.4   $ 191.8   $ 2,653.2  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) APMEA represents Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Other Countries  Corporate represents Canada, Latin America and Corporate. ##TABLE_END  LONG-LIVED ASSETS Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing McDonalds restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together at a television market level in the U.S. and at a country level for each of the international markets. The Company manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurants cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment (e.g., negative operating cash flows for the most recent trailing 24-month period) exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows. Losses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal, the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses relate to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered available for sale. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, and certain non-financial assets and liabilities on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value disclosures are reflected in a three-level hierarchy, maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: ##TABLE_START   Level 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for an identical asset or liability in an active market. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Level 2  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for a similar asset or liability in an active market or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END 32 McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 ##TABLE_START   Level 3  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END Certain of the Companys derivatives are valued using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate observable market parameters, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates, classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. Derivative valuations incorporate credit risk adjustments that are necessary to reflect the probability of default by the counterparty or the Company. ##TABLE_START   Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value ##TABLE_END The following tables present financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the valuation hierarchy as defined in the fair value guidance: ##TABLE_START December 31, 2011                In millions  Level 1   Level 2   Level 3  Carrying Value  Cash equivalents  $ 581.7     $ 581.7  Investments   132.4 *     132.4  Derivative assets   154.5 *  $ 71.1      225.6  Total assets at fair value  $ 868.6   $ 71.1     $ 939.7  Derivative payables      $ (15.6 )    $ (15.6 ) Total liabilities at fair value      $ (15.6 )    $ (15.6 ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START December 31, 2010                In millions  Level 1   Level 2   Level 3  Carrying Value  Cash equivalents  $ 722.5     $ 722.5  Investments   131.6 *     131.6  Derivative assets   104.4 *  $ 88.5      192.9  Total assets at fair value  $ 958.5   $ 88.5     $ 1,047.0  Derivative payables      $ (8.4 )    $ (8.4 ) Total liabilities at fair value      $ (8.4 )    $ (8.4 ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START * Includes investments and derivatives that hedge market driven changes in liabilities associated with the Companys supplemental benefit plans. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis ##TABLE_END Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). For the year ended December 31, 2011, no material fair value adjustments or fair value measurements were required for non-financial assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_START   Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2011, the fair value of the Companys debt obligations was estimated at $14.2 billion, compared to a carrying amount of $12.5 billion. This fair value was estimated using pricing models and discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated quoted market prices, Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. The carrying amount for both cash equivalents and notes receivable approximate fair value. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt and derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of these changes. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. The Company documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions, as well as all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items. The Companys derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments consist mainly of interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards and foreign currency options. Interest rate swaps are entered into to manage the interest rate risk associated with the Companys fixed and floating-rate borrowings. Foreign currency forwards and foreign currency options are entered into to mitigate the risk that forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies) will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Certain foreign currency denominated debt is used, in part, to protect the value of the Companys investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also enters into certain derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments. The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in selling, general  administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Since these derivatives are not designated for hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in nonoperating (income) expense together with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. A portion of the Companys foreign currency options (more fully described in the Cash Flow Hedging Strategy section) are undesignated as hedging instruments as the underlying foreign currency royalties are earned. All derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments are classified as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. All derivatives (including those not designated for hedge accounting) are recognized on the Consolidated balance sheet at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity date. Changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments are reflected as adjustments to other comprehensive income (OCI) and/or current earnings.

The fair value hedges the Company enters into consist of interest rate swaps which convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt. All of the Companys interest rate swaps meet the shortcut method requirements. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying debt. No ineffectiveness has been recorded to net income related to interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the year ended December 31, 2011. A total of $2.0 billion of the Companys outstanding fixed-rate debt was effectively converted to floating-rate debt resulting from the use of interest rate swaps. ##TABLE_START   Cash Flow Hedges ##TABLE_END The Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. The types of cash flow hedges the Company enters into include interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards and foreign currency options. The Company periodically uses interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of floating-rate debt, including forecasted debt issuances, into fixed-rate debt and the agreements are intended to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. At December 31, 2011, $250.0 million of the Companys anticipated debt issuances were effectively converted to fixed-rate resulting from the use of interest rate swaps. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies), the Company uses foreign currency forwards and foreign currency options to hedge a portion of anticipated exposures. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the decline in value of future foreign denominated royalties is offset by gains in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards and/or foreign currency options. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in the value of future foreign denominated royalties is offset by losses in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards and/or foreign currency options. Although the fair value changes in the foreign currency options may fluctuate over the period of the contract, the Companys total loss on a foreign currency option is limited to the upfront premium paid for the contract. However, the potential gains on a foreign currency option are unlimited as the settlement value of the contract is based upon the difference between the exchange rate at inception of the contract and the spot exchange rate at maturity. In limited situations, the Company uses foreign currency collars, which limit the potential gains and lower the upfront premium paid, to protect against currency movements. The hedges cover the next 15 months for certain exposures and are denominated in various currencies. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had derivatives outstanding with an equivalent notional amount of $228.0 million that were used to hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency denominated royalties. The Company excludes the time value of foreign currency options, as well as the forward points on foreign currency forwards, from its effectiveness assessment on its cash flow hedges. As a result, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to these components, as well as the ineffectiveness of the hedges, are recognized in earnings currently. The effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is reported in the cash flow hedging component of OCI in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company recorded after tax adjustments to the cash flow hedging component of accumulated OCI in shareholders equity. The Company recorded a net decrease of $10.4 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Based on interest rates and foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2011, the $4.6 million in cumulative cash flow hedging gains, after tax, at December 31, 2011, is not expected to have a significant effect on earnings over the next 12 months. ##TABLE_START   Net Investment Hedges ##TABLE_END The Company primarily uses foreign currency denominated debt (third party and intercompany) to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders equity in the foreign currency translation component of OCI and offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in OCI. As of December 31, 2011, a total of $4.3 billion of the Companys foreign currency denominated debt was designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. ##TABLE_START   Credit Risk ##TABLE_END The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its hedging instruments. The counterparties to these agreements consist of a diverse group of financial institutions. The Company continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and adjusts positions as appropriate. The Company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2011 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2011, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where its counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions. INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES The Company, like other multi-national companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. Accordingly, tax liabilities are recorded when, in managements judgment, a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may be recorded depending on managements assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled. The Company records interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.  McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 35 PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION Diluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of shares): 201112.8; 201014.3; 200915.2. Stock options that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutive were (in millions of shares): 20110.0; 20100.0; 20090.7. The Company has elected to exclude the pro forma deferred tax asset associated with share-based compensation in earnings per share. STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS The Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). There were no subsequent events that required recognition or disclosure except for the debt issuances in February 2012 (see Debt financing note).

These actions were designed to enhance the brand image, overall profitability and returns of the market. The Company also recorded pretax income of $21.0 million related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. In 2009, the Company recorded pretax income of $65.2 million related primarily to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. The Company also recognized a tax benefit in 2009 in connection with this income, mainly related to the release of a tax valuation allowance.

The Companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. ##TABLE_START   Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates ##TABLE_END Unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control. The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonalds share of results. For foreign affiliated marketsprimarily Japanresults are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonalds share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. are reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. ##TABLE_START   Asset dispositions and other expense ##TABLE_END Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for restaurant closings and uncollectible receivables, asset write-offs due to restaurant reinvestment, and other miscellaneous income and expenses. Gain on Sale of Investment In 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox Automated Retail, LLC to Coinstar, Inc., the majority  36 McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 owner, for total consideration of $144.9 million. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $94.9 million (after tax$58.8 million or $0.05 per share). Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. In connection with the sale in 2007 of its businesses in 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to a developmental licensee organization, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims, certain of which are reflected on McDonalds Consolidated balance sheet (2011 and 2010: other long-term liabilities$49.4 million and $49.6 million, respectively; 2011 and 2010: accrued payroll and other liabilities$21.2 million and $28.4 million, respectively). The Company believes any other matters currently being reviewed will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Franchise Arrangements Conventional franchise arrangements generally include a lease and a license and provide for payment of initial fees, as well as continuing rent and royalties to the Company based upon a percent of sales with minimum rent payments that parallel the Companys underlying leases and escalations (on properties that are leased). Under this arrangement, franchisees are granted the right to operate a restaurant using the McDonalds System and, in most cases, the use of a restaurant facility, generally for a period of 20 years. These franchisees pay related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. Affiliates and developmental licensees operating under license agreements pay a royalty to the Company based upon a percent of sales, and may pay initial fees. The results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees were not material either individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale. Revenues from franchised restaurants consisted of: ##TABLE_START In millions  2011   2010   2009  Rents  $ 5,718.5   $ 5,198.4   $ 4,841.0  Royalties   2,929.8    2,579.2    2,379.8  Initial fees   64.9    63.7    65.4  Revenues from franchised restaurants  $ 8,713.2   $ 7,841.3   $ 7,286.2  ##TABLE_END Future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements are: ##TABLE_START In millions  Owned sites   Leased sites   Total  2012  $ 1,277.9   $ 1,147.2   $ 2,425.1  2013   1,245.7    1,111.2    2,356.9  2014   1,207.2    1,065.3    2,272.5  2015   1,150.9    1,005.9    2,156.8  2016   1,090.5    946.4    2,036.9  Thereafter   8,914.2    7,035.1    15,949.3  Total minimum payments  $ 14,886.4   $ 12,311.1   $ 27,197.5  ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2011, net property and equipment under franchise arrangements totaled $13.8 billion (including land of $4.0 billion) after deducting accumulated depreciation and amortization of $7.1 billion. Leasing Arrangements At December 31, 2011, the Company was the lessee at 14,139 restaurant locations through ground leases (the Company leases the land and the Company or franchisee owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases land and buildings). Lease terms for most restaurants, where market conditions allow, are generally for 20 years and, in many cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options, with certain leases providing purchase options. Escalation terms vary by geographic segment with examples including fixed-rent escalations, escalations based on an inflation index, and fair-value market adjustments. The timing of these escalations generally ranges from annually to every five years. For most locations, the Company is obligated for the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance; however, for franchised sites, the Company requires the franchisees to pay these costs. In addition, the Company is the lessee under noncancelable leases covering certain offices and vehicles.

After considering the deferred tax accounting impact, it is expected that about $420 million of the total as of December 31, 2011 would favorably affect the effective tax rate if resolved in the Companys favor.  38 McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START In millions  2011   2010  Balance at January 1  $ 572.6   $ 492.0  Decreases for positions taken in prior years   (50.6 )   (27.1 ) Increases for positions taken in prior years   24.3    53.3  Increases for positions related to the current year   54.8    102.0  Settlements with taxing authorities   (14.4 )   (17.4 ) Lapsing of statutes of limitations   (21.7 )   (30.2 ) Balance at December 31 (1)  $ 565.0   $ 572.6  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Of this amount, $564.3 and $535.9 are included in long-term liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheet for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The remainder is included in deferred income taxes and income taxes payable on the Consolidated balance sheet. ##TABLE_END In 2010, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its field examination of the Companys U.S. federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. In connection with this examination, the Company received notices of proposed adjustments from the IRS related to certain foreign tax credits of about $400 million, excluding interest and potential penalties. The Company disagrees with the IRS proposed adjustments. The Company has filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office and expects resolution on this issue in 2012. The Company believes that the liabilities recorded related to this matter are appropriate and adequate and have been determined in accordance with ASC 740  Income Taxes. The Company is also under audit in multiple state tax jurisdictions where it is reasonably possible that the audits could be completed within 12 months. Due to the expected resolution of the 2007 and 2008 IRS Appeals process, the possible completion of the aforementioned audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next 12 months by $130 million to $140 million, of which $30 million to $40 million could favorably affect the effective tax rate. In addition, the Company is currently under audit in multiple tax jurisdictions where completion of the tax audits is not expected within 12 months. However, it is reasonably possible that, as a result of audit progression within the next 12 months, there may be new information that causes the Company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded. While the Company cannot estimate the impact that new information may have on our unrecognized tax benefit balance, we believe that the liabilities that are recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined under ASC 740. The Company is generally no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2005. The Company had $39.6 million and $44.4 million accrued for interest and penalties at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalties related to tax matters of $4.8 million in 2011, $29.0 million in 2010, and $1.5 million in 2009, which are included in the provision for income taxes. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. These temporary differences were approximately $12.6 billion at December 31, 2011 and consisted primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. Determination of the deferred income tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.  McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 39 Segment and Geographic Information The Company operates in the global restaurant industry and manages its business as distinct geographic segments. All intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in computing revenues and operating income. Corporate general  administrative expenses are included in Other Countries  Corporate and consist of home office support costs in areas such as facilities, finance, human resources, information technology, legal, marketing, restaurant operations, supply chain and training.

Debt Financing LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS At December 31, 2011, the Company had a $1.5 billion line of credit agreement expiring in November 2016 with fees of 0.065% per annum on the total commitment, which remained unused. Fees and interest rates on this line are based on the Companys long-term credit rating assigned by Moodys and Standard  Poors. In addition, the Company, including certain subsidiaries outside the U.S., had unused lines of credit totaling $838.9 million at December 31, 2011; these lines of credit were primarily uncommitted, short-term and denominated in various currencies at local market rates of interest. The weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings was 4.6% at December 31, 2011 (based on $640.3 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings and $250.0 million of commercial paper) and 4.3% at December 31, 2010 (based on $595.0 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings). DEBT OBLIGATIONS The Company has incurred debt obligations principally through public and private offerings and bank loans. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions, and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. Under certain agreements, the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at par or at a premium over par. The Company has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt prior to maturity. In February 2012, the Company issued $250.0 million of 10-year U.S. Dollar-denominated notes at a coupon rate of 2.625%, and $500.0 million of 30-year U.S. Dollar-denominated notes at a coupon rate of 3.7%. ESOP LOANS Borrowings related to the leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) at December 31, 2011, which include $39.6 million of loans from the Company to the ESOP, are reflected as debt with a corresponding reduction of shareholders equity (additional paid-in capital included a balance of $34.4 million and $41.7 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively). The ESOP is repaying the loans and interest through 2018 using Company contributions and dividends from its McDonalds common stock holdings. As the principal amount of the borrowings is repaid, the debt and the unearned ESOP compensation (additional paid-in capital) are reduced.  40 McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 The following table summarizes the Companys debt obligations.

These amounts include a reclassification of short-term obligations totaling $1.5 billion to long-term obligations as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in November 2016. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4) The carrying value of underlying items in fair value hedges, in this case debt obligations, are adjusted for fair value changes to the extent they are attributable to the risk designated as being hedged. The related hedging instrument is also recorded at fair value in prepaid expenses and other current assets, miscellaneous other assets or other long-term liabilities. A portion ($0.5 million) of the adjustments at December 31, 2011 related to interest rate swaps that were terminated in December 2002 and will amortize as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (5) Includes notes payable, current maturities of long-term debt and long-term debt included on the Consolidated balance sheet. The increase in debt obligations from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 was primarily due to net issuances of $1.0 billion. ##TABLE_END  Share-based Compensation The Company maintains a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plans was 61.4 million at December 31, 2011, including 27.6 million available for future grants. STOCK OPTIONS Stock options to purchase common stock are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Companys stock on the date of grant. Substantially all of the options become exercisable in four equal installments, beginning a year from the date of the grant, and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. Options granted between May 1, 1999 and December 31, 2000 (approximately 3.5 million options outstanding at December 31, 2011) expire 13 years from the date of grant. Intrinsic value for stock options is defined as the difference between the current market value of the Companys stock and the exercise price. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $416.5 million, $500.8 million and $302.5 million, respectively. Cash received from stock options exercised during 2011 was $334.0 million and the actual tax benefit realized for tax deductions from stock options exercised totaled $110.6 million. The Company uses treasury shares purchased under the Companys share repurchase program to satisfy share-based exercises.  McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 41 A summary of the status of the Companys stock option grants as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, and changes during the years then ended, is presented in the following table: ##TABLE_START   2011     2010     2009  Options  Shares in millions   Weighted- average exercise price   Weighted- average remaining contractual life in years   Aggregate intrinsic value in millions      Shares in millions   Weighted- average exercise price      Shares in millions   Weighted- average exercise price  Outstanding at beginning of year   37.4   $ 42.47       47.8   $ 38.16     53.4   $ 34.88  Granted   3.9    75.97       4.5    63.26     5.6    56.94  Exercised   (9.0 )   37.46       (13.6 )   33.84     (10.7 )   31.17  Forfeited/expired   (0.6 )   55.00              (1.3 )   46.03      (0.5 )   47.22  Outstanding at end of year   31.7   $ 47.77    5.1   $ 1,667.6      37.4   $ 42.47      47.8   $ 38.16  Exercisable at end of year   21.9   $ 39.53    3.7   $ 1,328.8      26.4          35.4      ##TABLE_END RSUs RSUs generally vest 100% on the third anniversary of the grant and are payable in either shares of McDonalds common stock or cash, at the Companys discretion. Certain executives have been awarded RSUs that vest based on Company performance. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. A summary of the Companys RSU activity during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 is presented in the following table: ##TABLE_START   2011     2010     2009  RSUs  Shares in millions   Weighted- average grant date fair value      Shares in millions   Weighted- average grant date fair value      Shares in millions   Weighted- average grant date fair value  Nonvested at beginning of year   2.3   $ 51.17     2.8   $ 46.33     3.0   $ 40.88  Granted   0.6    67.96     0.7    56.09     0.9    50.34  Vested   (0.7 )   49.88     (1.1 )   42.08     (1.0 )   34.56  Forfeited   (0.1 )   50.16      (0.1 )   49.61      (0.1 )   43.87  Nonvested at end of year   2.1   $ 56.78      2.3   $ 51.17      2.8   $ 46.33  ##TABLE_END The Company realized tax deductions of $6.1 million from RSUs vested during 2011. The total fair value of RSUs vested during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $55.5 million, $66.8 million and $59.9 million, respectively.  Employee Benefit Plans The Companys Profit Sharing and Savings Plan for U.S.-based employees includes a 401(k) feature, a regular employee match feature, and a discretionary employer profit sharing match. The 401(k) feature allows participants to make pretax contributions that are matched each pay period from shares released under the ESOP. The Profit Sharing and Savings Plan also provides for a discretionary employer profit sharing match after the end of the year for those participants eligible to share in the match. All current account balances and future contributions and related earnings can be invested in several investment alternatives as well as McDonalds common stock in accordance with each participants elections. Participants contributions to the 401(k) feature and the discretionary employer matching contribution feature are limited to 20% investment in McDonalds common stock. Participants may choose to make separate investment choices for current account balances and for future contributions. The Company also maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan because of Internal Revenue Service limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities were $482.5 million at December 31, 2011, and $439.3 million at December 31, 2010, and were primarily included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheet. The Company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of the liabilities. At December 31, 2011, derivatives with a fair value of $154.5 million indexed to the Companys stock were included in miscellaneous other assets and an investment totaling $98.3 million indexed to certain market indices was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated balance sheet. All changes in liabilities for these nonqualified plans and in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in selling, general  administrative expenses. Changes in fair value of the derivatives indexed to the Companys stock are recorded in the income statement because the contracts provide the counterparty with a choice to settle in cash or shares. Total U.S. costs for the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan, including nonqualified benefits and related hedging activities, were (in millions): 2011$41.3; 2010$51.4; 2009$51.3.

The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: ##TABLE_START  I. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  II. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  III. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ##TABLE_END There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may vary over time. Management assessed the design and effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework. Based on managements assessment using those criteria, as of December 31, 2011, management believes that the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. Ernst  Young, LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 and the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. Their reports are presented on the following pages. The independent registered public accountants and internal auditors advise management of the results of their audits, and make recommendations to improve the system of internal controls. Management evaluates the audit recommendations and takes appropriate action. McDONALDS CORPORATION February 24, 2012  44 McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonalds Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McDonalds Corporation as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of McDonalds Corporation at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), McDonalds Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. ERNST  YOUNG LLP Chicago, Illinois February 24, 2012  McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 45 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonalds Corporation We have audited McDonalds Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). McDonalds Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report on Managements Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, McDonalds Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of McDonalds Corporation as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, and our report dated February 24, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Business  ##TABLE_ENDMcDonalds Corporation, the registrant, together with its sub-sidiaries, is referred to herein as the Company. a. General development of business During 2012 , there have been no material changes to the Companys corporate structure or in its method of conducting business. In 2012 , the Company has continued the process it began in 2005 to realign certain subsidiaries to develop a corporate structure within its geographic segments that better reflects the operation of the McDonalds worldwide business. b. Financial information about segments Segment data for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 are included in Part II, Item 8, page 40 of this Form 10-K. c. Narrative description of business ##TABLE_START  General ##TABLE_END The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants in the global restaurant industry. These restaurants serve a broad menu (see Products) at various price points providing value in 119 countries around the world. All restaurants are operated either by the Company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchise arrangements, and developmental licensees and foreign affiliated markets under license agreements. The Companys operations are designed to assure consistency and high quality at every restaurant. When granting franchises or licenses, the Company is selective and generally is not in the practice of franchising to passive investors. Under the conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and dcor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. A discussion regarding site selection is included in Part I, Item 2, page 5 of this Form 10-K. Conventional franchisees contribute to the Companys revenue stream through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees received upon the opening of a new restaurant or the granting of a new franchise term. The conventional franchise arrangement typically lasts 20 years, and franchising practices are generally consistent throughout the world. Over 70% of franchised restaurants operate under conventional franchise arrangements. Under a developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest. While the Company has no capital invested, it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales, as well as initial fees. The largest of these developmental license arrangements operates over 1,900 restaurants across 19 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Company has an equity investment in a limited number of foreign affiliated markets, referred to as \"affiliates.\" The largest of these affiliates is Japan, where there are nearly 3,300 restaurants. The Company receives a royalty based on a percent of sales in these markets and records its share of net results in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. The Company and its franchisees purchase food, packaging, equipment and other goods from numerous independent suppliers. The Company has established and strictly enforces high quality standards and product specifications. The Company has quality centers around the world to ensure that its high standards are consistently met. The quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews, but also on-site supplier visits. A quality leadership board, composed of the Companys technical, safety and supply chain specialists, provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food quality and safety. In addition, the Company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation, assure best practices and drive continuous improvement. Leveraging scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies, the Company also collaborates with suppliers toward a goal of achieving competitive, predictable food and paper costs over the long term. Independently owned and operated distribution centers, approved by the Company, distribute products and supplies to most McDonalds restaurants. In addition, restaurant personnel are trained in the proper storage, handling and preparation of products and in the delivery of customer service. McDonalds global brand is well known. Marketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed to promote McDonalds brand image and differentiate the Company from competitors. Marketing and promotional efforts focus on value, food taste, menu choice, nutrition, convenience and the customer experience. The Company continuously endeavors to improve its social responsibility and environmental practices to achieve long-term sustainability, which benefits McDonalds and the communities it serves.  ##TABLE_START  Products ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu, although there are geographic variations to suit local consumer preferences and tastes. In addition, McDonalds tests new products on an ongoing basis. McDonalds menu includes hamburgers and cheeseburgers, Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Filet-O-Fish, several chicken sandwiches, Chicken McNuggets, Snack Wraps, french fries, salads, oatmeal, shakes, McFlurry desserts, sundaes, soft serve cones, pies, soft drinks, coffee, McCaf beverages and other beverages. In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of other products during limited-time promotions. McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. and many international markets offer a full or limited breakfast menu. Breakfast offerings may include Egg McMuffin, Sausage McMuffin with Egg, McGriddles, biscuit and bagel sandwiches and hotcakes.  ##TABLE_START  Intellectual property ##TABLE_END The Company owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information. The Company considers the trademarks McDonalds and The Golden Arches Logo to be of material importance to its business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. Patents, copyrights and licenses are of varying remaining durations.  ##TABLE_START  Seasonal operations ##TABLE_END The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree.  ##TABLE_START  Working capital practices ##TABLE_END Information about the Companys working capital practices is incorporated herein by reference to Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the  McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 1 years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 in Part II, Item 7, pages 10 through 26, and the Consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 in Part II, Item 8, page 30 of this Form 10-K.  ##TABLE_START  Customers ##TABLE_END The Companys business is not dependent upon either a single customer or small group of customers.  ##TABLE_START  Backlog ##TABLE_END Company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders.  ##TABLE_START  Government contracts ##TABLE_END No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government.  ##TABLE_START  Competition ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of food products. The Company competes on the basis of price, convenience, service, menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry. In measuring the Companys competitive position, management reviews data compiled by Euromonitor International, a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry. The Companys primary competition, which management refers to as the Informal Eating Out (\"IEO\") segment, includes the following restaurant categories defined by Euromonitor International: quick-service eating establishments, casual dining full-service restaurants, 100% home delivery/takeaway providers, street stalls or kiosks, specialist coffee shops, juice/smoothie bars and self-service cafeterias. The IEO segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and full-service restaurants other than casual dining. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the global IEO segment was composed of approximately 7.0 million outlets and generated $1.05 trillion in annual sales in 2011 , the most recent year for which data is available. McDonalds Systemwide 2011 restaurant business accounted for approximately 0.5% of those outlets and about 8% of the sales. Management also on occasion benchmarks McDonalds against the entire restaurant industry, including the IEO segment defined above and all other full-service restaurants. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 14.8 million outlets and generated about $2.11 trillion in annual sales in 2011 . McDonalds Systemwide restaurant business accounted for approximately 0.2% of those outlets and about 4% of the sales. ##TABLE_START  Research and development ##TABLE_END The Company operates research and development facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. While research and development activities are important to the Companys business, these expenditures are not material. Independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the \"System\").  ##TABLE_START  Environmental matters ##TABLE_END Increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives, particularly in the area of climate change. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. Although the impact would likely vary by world region and/or market, we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs, including for the Company, its franchisees and suppliers. Also, there is a possibility that governmental initiatives, or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns or climate, could have a direct impact on the operations of our restaurants or the operations of our suppliers in ways which we cannot predict at this time. The Company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner. At this time, the Company has already begun to undertake its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment, including the development of a means to monitor and reduce energy use, in many of its markets.  ##TABLE_START  Number of employees ##TABLE_END The Companys number of employees worldwide, including Company-operated restaurant employees, was approximately 440,000 as of year-end 2012 . d. Financial information about geographic areas Financial information about geographic areas is incorporated herein by reference to Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in Part II, Item 7, pages 10 through 26 and Segment and geographic information in Part II, Item 8, page 40 of this Form 10-K. e.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  ##TABLE_END The information on this report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook for 2013. These statements use such words as may, will, expect, believe and plan. They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements. Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. The most important of these is whether we can remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment. The IEO segment of the restaurant industry, although largely mature in our major markets, is highly fragmented and competitive. The IEO segment has been flat or contracting in many of our markets, including some of our major markets, due to unfavorable global economic conditions, and this environment is expected to continue. Persistently high unemployment rates in many of these markets, and declining economic growth rates or recessionary conditions in some of them, have also increased consumer focus on value and heightened pricing sensitivity. Combined with pressure on labor and occupancy costs and volatility in commodity prices, as well as aggressive competitive activity, these circumstances affect restaurant sales and are expected to continue to pressure margins during 2013 in all of our geographic segments. We have the added challenge of the cultural and regulatory differences that exist within and among the more than 100 countries where we operate. Initiatives we undertake may not have universal appeal among different segments of our customer base and can drive unanticipated changes in guest counts and customer perceptions. Our operations, plans and results are also affected by regulatory and similar initiatives around the world, notably the focus on nutritional content and the production, processing and preparation of food from field to front counter, as well as industry marketing practices. These risks can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance. Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales and profits depends largely on how well we execute the Plan to Win and our global priorities. The Plan to Win addresses the key drivers of our business and results - people, products, place, price and promotion - and we are focused on our three global priorities that represent the greatest opportunities under our Plan to Win: optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to our Brand. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following: ##TABLE_START  Our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to trends or other factors that affect the IEO segment and our competitive position in the diverse markets we serve, such as spending patterns, demographic changes, trends in food preparation, consumer preferences and publicity about us, all of which can drive popular perceptions of our business or affect the willingness of other companies to enter into site, supply or other arrangements or alliances with us; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The risks associated with our franchise business model, including whether our franchisees and developmental licensees will have the experience and financial resources to be effective operators and remain aligned with us on ##TABLE_ENDoperating, promotional and capital-intensive initiatives and the potential impact on us if they experience food safety or other operational problems or project a brand image inconsistent with our values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited by law or otherwise, costly to exercise or subject to litigation; ##TABLE_START  The success of our tiered approach to menu offerings and our ability to introduce new offerings, as well as the impact of our competitors' actions, including in response to our menu changes, and our ability to continue robust menu development and manage the complexity of our restaurant operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our ability to differentiate the McDonald's experience in a way that balances consumer value with margin levels, particularly in markets where pricing or cost pressures are significant or have been exacerbated by the current challenging economic and operating environment; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of pricing, marketing and promotional plans on sales and margins and our ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly to changing economic and heightened competitive conditions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our ability to drive restaurant improvements that achieve optimal capacity, particularly during peak mealtime hours, and to motivate our restaurant personnel and our franchisees to achieve consistency and high service levels so as to improve consumer perceptions of our ability to meet expectations for quality food served in clean and friendly environments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Whether we can complete our restaurant reimaging and rebuilding plans as projected, and whether we are able to identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants, as well as sales and profitability targets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The costs and risks associated with our increasing reliance on information systems (e.g., point-of-sale and other in-store systems or platforms) that support our restaurants and that we make available to franchisees along with related services, including the risk that we will not realize fully the benefits of the significant investments we are making, which are intended to enhance the customer experience; the potential for system failures, programming errors, security breaches involving our systems or those of third-party system operators; legal and tax risks associated with providing these services to franchisees, including those relating to data protection and management; and litigation risk involving intellectual property rights or our rights and obligations to others under related contractual arrangements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The success of our initiatives to support menu choice, physical activity and nutritional awareness and to address these and other matters of social responsibility in a way that communicates our values effectively and inspires trust and confidence; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our ability to respond effectively to adverse perceptions about the quick-service category of the IEO segment or about our food (including its nutritional content and preparation), promotions and premiums, such as Happy Meal toys (collectively, our \"products\"), how we source the commodities we use, and our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonald's of food-borne illnesses or product safety issues; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of campaigns by labor organizations and activists or the use of social media and other mobile communications and applications to promote adverse perceptions of our operations or those of our suppliers, or to promote or ##TABLE_END McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 3 threaten boycotts or other actions involving us or our suppliers; ##TABLE_START  The impact of events such as boycotts or protests, labor strikes and supply chain interruptions (including due to lack of supply or price increases) that can adversely affect us or the vendors, franchisees and others that are also part of the McDonald's System and whose performance has a material impact on our results; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel to manage our operations and growth; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our ability to leverage promotional or operating successes in individual markets into other markets in a timely and cost-effective way. ##TABLE_END Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, and the prolonged challenging economic environment can be expected to continue to pressure our results. Our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions, both globally and in local markets, and conditions can also vary substantially by market. The current global environment has been characterized by persistently weak economies, high unemployment rates, inflationary pressures and volatility in financial markets. Many major economies, both advanced and developing, are also facing significant economic issues. These include, in the U.S., concerns about the federal deficit and the potential adverse effects of the automatic spending cuts that will become effective in early 2013 absent further legislation. The Eurozone debt crisis continues to depress consumer and business confidence and spending in many markets. Important markets in Asia, which have been key drivers of global growth, have been experiencing declining growth rates. Uncertainty about the long-term investment environment could further depress capital investment and economic activity. These conditions are adversely affecting sales and/or guest counts in many of our markets, including some of our major markets. To mitigate their impact, we have intensified our focus on value as a driver of guest counts through menu, pricing and promotional actions. These actions have adversely affected our margin percent, and margins will remain under pressure. The key factors that can affect our operations, plans and results in this environment are the following: ##TABLE_START  Whether our strategies will be effective in enabling the continued market share gains that we have included in our plans, while at the same time enabling us to achieve our targeted operating income growth despite the current adverse economic conditions, resurgent competitors and a more costly and competitive advertising environment; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient product supply on favorable terms; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact on consumer disposable income levels and spending habits of governmental actions to manage national economic matters, whether through austerity or stimulus measures and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact on restaurant sales and margins of ongoing commodity price volatility, and the effectiveness of pricing, hedging and other actions taken to address this environment; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact on our margins of labor costs and the long-term trend toward higher wages and social expenses in both mature and developing markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of foreign exchange and interest rates on our financial condition and results; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest, all of which are exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment charges that reduce our earnings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The increasing focus on workplace practices and conditions, which may drive changes in practices or in the general commercial and regulatory environment that affect perceptions of our business or our cost of doing business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of changes in our debt levels on our credit ratings, interest expense, availability of acceptable counterparties, ability to obtain funding on favorable terms or our operating or financial flexibility, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of an exit from the Eurozone by any of the EU Member States, which could entail disruption to our business as the exiting Member State establishes a new currency and we, along with our suppliers, franchisees and others, address the challenges associated with redenomination. ##TABLE_END Increasing legal and regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following: ##TABLE_START  The cost, compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face, especially in the United States where inconsistent standards imposed by local, state and federal authorities can adversely affect popular perceptions of our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of new, potential or changing regulations that can affect our business plans, such as those relating to product packaging, marketing and the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products, as well as the risks and costs of our labeling and other disclosure practices, particularly given varying legal requirements and practices for testing and disclosure within our industry, ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants, and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of nutritional, health and other scientific inquiries and conclusions, which constantly evolve and often have contradictory implications, but nonetheless drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation, including taxation, in ways that could be material to our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of litigation trends, particularly in our major markets, including class actions, labor, employment and personal injury claims, franchisee litigation, landlord/tenant disputes and intellectual property claims (including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems); the relative level of our ##TABLE_END4 McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings; the cost and other effects of settlements or judgments, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products; and the scope and terms of insurance or indemnification protections that we may have; ##TABLE_START  Adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change, as well as of increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental and non-governmental organizations on environmental sustainability matters (e.g., climate change, land use, energy and water resources, packaging and waste, and animal health and welfare) and the increased pressure to make commitments or set targets and take actions to meet them, which could expose the Company to market, operational and execution costs or risks, particularly when actions are undertaken Systemwide; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The increasing costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and overseas regulations affecting our workforce and labor practices, including regulations relating to wage and hour practices, workplace conditions, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and unlawful workplace discrimination; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Disruptions in our operations or price volatility in a market that can result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or import-export controls, increased tariffs or government-mandated closure of our or our vendors' operations, and the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or proceedings, whether or not they have merit; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The legal and compliance risks and costs associated with privacy, consumer data protection and similar laws, particularly as they apply to children, the potential costs (including the loss of consumer confidence) arising from alleged security breaches of our information systems, and the risk of criminal penalties or civil liability to consumers, employees or franchisees whose data is alleged to have been collected or used inappropriately; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, changes in tax accounting or tax laws (or related authoritative interpretations), particularly if corporate tax reform becomes a key component of budgetary initiatives in the United States and elsewhere, and the impact of settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the IRS or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. ##TABLE_END The trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors. Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these, some of which are outside our control, are the following: ##TABLE_START  The continuing unfavorable global economic and volatile market conditions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the United States which is ##TABLE_ENDthe principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business; ##TABLE_START  Changes in financial or tax reporting and accounting principles or practices that materially affect our reported financial condition and results and investor perceptions of our performance; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can reflect market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete in some cases) or expectations about our business, our creditworthiness or investor confidence generally; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonald's may be included, such as the SP 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of our stock repurchase program or dividend rate; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact on our results of other corporate actions, such as those we may take from time to time as part of our continuous review of our corporate structure in light of business, legal and tax considerations. ##TABLE_END Our results and prospects can be adversely affected by events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others. Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels or other factors that affect our results and prospects, such as commodity costs. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments  ##TABLE_ENDNone. ##TABLE_START ", "2": " ITEM 2. Properties  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company owns and leases real estate primarily in connection with its restaurant business. The Company identifies and develops sites that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential to the Company. To assess potential, the Company analyzes traffic and walking patterns, census data and other relevant data. The Companys experience and access to advanced technology aid in evaluating this information. The Company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for restaurant sites, which ensures long-term occupancy rights and helps control related costs. Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to control average development costs through construction and design efficiencies, standardization and by leveraging the Companys global sourcing network. Additional information about the Companys properties is included in Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in Part II, Item 7, pages 10 through 26 and in Financial statements and supplementary data in Part II, Item 8, pages 26 through 43 of this Form 10-K.

These lawsuits cover a broad variety of allegations spanning the Companys entire business. The following is a brief description of the more significant types of lawsuits. In addition, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local regulations that impact various aspects of its business, as discussed below. While the Company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, unfavorable rulings could occur. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on net income for the period in which the ruling occurs or for future periods.  ##TABLE_START  Franchising ##TABLE_END A substantial number of McDonalds restaurants are franchised to independent entrepreneurs operating under contractual arrangements with the Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company and its franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects including, but not limited to, quality, service and cleanliness issues, contentions regarding grants or terminations of franchises, delinquent payments of rents and fees, and franchisee claims for additional franchises or rewrites of franchises. Additionally, occasional disputes arise between the Company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a McDonalds franchise. ##TABLE_START  Suppliers ##TABLE_END The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries generally do not supply food, paper or related items to any McDonalds restaurants. The Company relies upon numerous independent suppliers that are required to meet and maintain the Companys high standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company and its suppliers which include, by way of example, compliance with product specifications and the Companys business relationship with suppliers. In addition, disputes occasionally arise on a number of issues between the Company and individuals or entities who claim that they should be (or should have been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the Companys restaurants. ##TABLE_START  Employees ##TABLE_END Hundreds of thousands of people are employed by the Company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, thousands of people from time to time seek employment in such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes arise regarding hiring, firing, promotion and pay practices, including wage and hour disputes, alleged discrimination and compliance with employment laws.  ##TABLE_START  Customers ##TABLE_END Restaurants owned by subsidiaries of the Company regularly serve a broad segment of the public. In so doing, disputes arise as to products, service, incidents, advertising, nutritional and other disclosures, as well as other matters common to an extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company.  ##TABLE_START  Intellectual Property ##TABLE_END The Company has registered trademarks and service marks, patents and copyrights, some of which are of material importance to the Companys business. From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation to protect its intellectual property and defend against the alleged use of third party intellectual property.  ##TABLE_START  Government Regulations ##TABLE_END Local, state and federal governments have adopted laws and regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business including, but not limited to, advertising, franchising, health, safety, environment, zoning and employment. The Company strives to comply with all applicable existing statutory and administrative rules and cannot predict the effect on its operations from the issuance of additional requirements in the future. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " ITEM 4.

Franchised restaurants represent more than 80% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide. ##TABLE_END  McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 9 ##TABLE_START ", "7": " ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  ##TABLE_ENDOverview DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants. Of the 34,480 restaurants in 119 countries at year-end 2012 , 27,882 were franchised or licensed (including 19,869 franchised to conventional franchisees, 4,350 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,663 licensed to foreign affiliates (\"affiliates\")primarily Japan) and 6,598 were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and dcor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market. We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. However, directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In our Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. We continually review, and as appropriate adjust, our mix of Company-operated and franchised or licensed (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and foreign affiliated) restaurants to help optimize overall performance. The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (\"U.S.\"), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (\"APMEA\"). In addition, throughout this report we present Other Countries  Corporate that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 32% , 39% and 23% of total revenues, respectively. The United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), France and Germany, collectively, account for 51% of Europes revenues; and China, Australia and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for 56% of APMEAs revenues. These six markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise 70% of total revenues. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth and returns. ##TABLE_START  Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because we believe this better represents the Companys underlying business trends. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Companys initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Generally, the goal is to achieve a balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. ##TABLE_END McDonalds reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal. ##TABLE_START  Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Companys financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Return on incremental invested capital (\"ROIIC\") is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. ##TABLE_END STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The strength of the alignment between the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the \"System\") has been key to McDonald's success. This business model enables McDonald's to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve. In addition, it facilitates our ability to identify, implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. 10 McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report McDonald's customer-focused Plan to Win (\"Plan\") provides a common framework for our global business while allowing for local adaptation. Through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five pillars of our PlanPeople, Products, Place, Price and Promotionwe have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown global comparable sales and guest counts in each of the last nine years. This Plan, combined with financial discipline, has delivered strong results for our shareholders since its inception. To measure our performance as we continue to build the business, we have the following long-term, average annual constant currency financial targets: ##TABLE_START  Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating income growth of 6% to 7%; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ROIIC in the high teens. ##TABLE_END Prior to 2012, we exceeded each of these financial targets every year since the Plan's implementation in 2003, after adjusting for the loss in 2007 from the Latin America developmental license transaction. These targets have enabled us to make the best decisions for the long-term benefit of our shareholders, and we believe they remain realistic and sustainable for a company of our size. In 2012, Systemwide sales growth was 3% (5% in constant currencies), operating income growth was 1% (4% in constant currencies), one-year ROIIC was 15.4% and three-year ROIIC was 28.6% (see reconciliation on page 24). Persistent global economic headwinds, heightened competitive activity and inflationary costs impacted results. In addition, planned strategic decisions, such as the 2012 London Olympics sponsorship, investing in technology and the biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator convention, also impacted results. In 2012, we continued to focus on customers' needs and remained aligned on our Plan and the three global growth priorities of optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening accessibility to our brand. We believe these priorities are relevant and actionable, and combined with our competitive advantages, will drive long-term sustainable growth. Initiatives supporting these priorities resonated with customers and drove increases in global comparable sales and guest counts of 3.1% and 1.6%, respectively, despite challenging economies and a relatively flat or declining Informal Eating Out (\"IEO\") segment in most markets. In 2012, we continued to grow market share in the U.S., Europe and APMEA, amid a more competitive global environment and a slight decline in our fourth quarter comparable guest counts. Comparable sales are impacted by guest counts, product mix shifts and menu pricing. Specific menu pricing actions across our system reflect local market conditions as well as other factors, notably food away from home and food at home inflation indices. In our Company-operated restaurants, we manage menu board prices to ensure value at all price points, increase profitability and mitigate inflation, all while trying to grow guest counts. In order to accomplish these objectives, we utilize a strategic pricing tool that balances price and product mix. Franchisees also have access to, and many utilize, this strategic pricing tool. In general, we believe franchisees employ a similar pricing strategy. We look to optimize product mix by utilizing a menu with entry-point value, core, premium and promotional offerings. We also introduce new products to meet customers' needs, which can expand average check and increase guest counts. In 2012, average prices increased at Company-operated restaurants in each area of the world, although increases varied by market and region. U.S. In the U.S., comparable sales increased for the tenth consecutive year, rising 3.3% in 2012, while comparable guest counts rose 1.9%. These results were achieved despite only modest growth in the IEO segment and heightened competitive activity. In the second half of the year, we experienced softer performance; therefore, we adjusted our plans to re-energize our all-day everyday value offerings while providing the menu variety customers expect from McDonald's. In 2012, we continued to highlight beverages, value, breakfast, and our classic core favorites. We expanded our McCaf beverage offerings with the Chocolate Chip Frapp and Cherry Berry Chiller. Limited-time offers, such as Chicken McBites and the Cheddar Bacon Onion premium sandwiches, complemented our core menu offerings. Modernizing the customer experience continued through our major remodeling initiative, which provides contemporary restaurant designs and retailing efforts. The enhanced appearance and functionality of our restaurants deliver a more relevant experience for our customers. Over 900 existing restaurants were remodeled during 2012 with the majority adding drive-thru capacity to capture additional guest counts. We broadened the accessibility of our convenient locations through extended hours and efficient drive-thru service. More than half of our restaurants use some form of multiple order points to maximize drive-thru capacity, including 1,500 with hand-held order takers to help improve customer service times. To further build on our competitive advantage, we focused on operations excellence initiatives to drive customer satisfaction as we strive to deliver fast, accurate and friendly service with every order. Europe In Europe, comparable sales rose 2.4%, marking the ninth consecutive year of comparable sales increases, while guest counts declined 0.5%. While low consumer confidence continues to negatively affect overall retail sales and the IEO segment, we outperformed the market and grew market share. Major contributors to comparable sales were the U.K. and Russia. Despite ongoing economic challenges, the segment's priority remains growing the overall business by balancing a strong focus on our unique value offerings, ongoing premium product innovation, and new products. Europe continued to see the benefit of providing a relevant, contemporary customer experience and completed almost 750 restaurant reimages. By the end of 2012, over 90% of restaurant interiors and approximately 50% of exteriors had been reimaged. Europe also invested in a roll-out of a new point-of-sale system, which allows us to continue to expand our menu offerings and improve order accuracy. By the end of 2012, over 2,200 restaurants had deployed this system. We expanded our coffee business and have over 1,600 McCaf locations, which in Europe are generally separate areas inside the restaurants that serve specialty coffees, desserts and snacks. In addition, we increased our accessibility and convenience with extended operating hours, self-order kiosks, optimized drive-thrus, and opened over 250 new restaurants. APMEA In APMEA, comparable sales rose 1.4% and comparable guest counts rose 2.2%, despite a challenging year of economic pressures, partly due to Japan's uneven recovery and China's slower economic growth. Positive performance was driven by China, Australia and many other markets. Unique value platforms, great tasting premium menu selections, locally-relevant menu variety, and convenience and service enhancements differentiated the McDonald's experience. Australia launched the Loose Change Menu, which is a branded affordability menu, while China focused on breakfast, lunch, and dinner value platforms. Value initiatives were balanced with mid-tier offers, such as Bubble Tea in China, and premium limited-time offers, such as the Serious Lamb Burger and Wrap in Australia.  McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 11 Our breakfast business has expanded and is offered in approximately 75% of APMEA restaurants. Desserts continued to play a meaningful role, particularly in China, where we remain one of the largest ice cream retailers. We opened over 750 new restaurants in APMEA, of which over 250 were in China, where we have made significant progress toward our goal of 2,000 restaurants by the end of 2013. Nearly two-thirds of APMEA restaurants are offering some form of extended operating hours and over 5,400 restaurants are open 24 hours. Delivery is offered in many APMEA markets and is now available in over 1,700 restaurants, including nearly 550 in China. Since Japan's natural disaster in March of 2011, the economy remains a challenge. Despite a declining IEO segment, McDonald's is gaining market share through a value platform of 100, 250, and 500 YEN offerings, and family sharing boxes, such as 15-piece Chicken McNuggets. Japan augmented its value platform with strategic couponing to encourage add-on and Extra Value Meal purchases. Consolidated Globally, our approach to offering affordable value to our customers is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and leveraging our scale, supply chain infrastructure and our suppliers' risk management practices to manage costs. We were able to execute our strategies in every area of the world, grow comparable sales and control selling, general and administrative expenses. However, in 2012 we faced top- and bottom-line pressures, some a result of planned strategic decisions, and others driven by the external environment. As a result, combined operating margin (operating income as a percent of total revenues) was 31.2% in 2012, down 0.4 percentage points as compared to 2011. In 2012, cash from operations was nearly $7.0 billion. Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures of approximately $3.0 billion were invested in our business primarily to reimage existing restaurants and open new restaurants. Across the System, over 1,400 restaurants were opened and about 2,400 existing locations were reimaged. In addition, we returned $5.5 billion to shareholders consisting of $2.9 billion in dividends and $2.6 billion in share repurchases. Cash from operations continues to benefit from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owner/operators is a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs. In addition, the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the Company-owned model. We believe locally-owned and operated restaurants maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantages, making McDonald's not just a global brand but also a locally relevant one. HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE YEAR INCLUDED: ##TABLE_START  Comparable sales grew 3.1% and guest counts rose 1.6% , building on 2011 increases of 5.6% and 3.7% , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Revenues increased  2% ( 5% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating income increased  1% ( 4% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted earnings per share was $5.36 , an increase of 2% ( 5% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash provided by operations was nearly $7.0 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  One-year ROIIC was 15.4% and three-year ROIIC was 28.6% for the period ended December 31, 2012 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 10% to $0.77 for the fourth quarterbringing our current annual dividend to $3.08 per share. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company returned $5.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. ##TABLE_END OUTLOOK FOR 2013  We will continue to build the business in 2013 and beyond by enhancing the customer experience across all pillars of our Plan and our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience and broaden accessibility to our brand. We remain focused on seizing the long-term opportunities in the $1 trillion IEO segment by leveraging our competitive advantages. We have a brand advantage in convenience, menu variety and value, a resilient business model, and the experience and alignment throughout the McDonald's System to navigate the current environment. Our number one priority continues to be satisfying our customers' needs by serving great-tasting, high-quality food in contemporary restaurants. This focus on our customers is particularly critical in this uncertain environment, where ongoing volatility continues to negatively impact consumer sentiment and spending. We anticipate a continued flat to declining IEO segment in many of the markets where we operate. Growing market share will remain our focus to attain sustainable and profitable long-term growth. We will highlight promotions of our core menu favorites, while strategically expanding our menu with relevant new offerings across all dayparts, including premium products that can deliver a higher average check. We will place an even greater emphasis on scaling success quickly around the globe. For example, in many markets we will expand our innovative McBites line-up, introduce existing products like our blended ice beverages and large McWraps into new markets, and offer even more of the unique, flavor-based promotional food events that have been successful. We will emphasize our daypartslike breakfast and extended hoursthat are still growing globally in both established and emerging markets. We will enhance the customer experience by continuing to reimage our building interiors and exteriors and by providing our restaurant teams with the appropriate tools, training, and technology. The accessibility efforts will include increasing the level and variety of conveniences provided to our customers through new restaurant openings, extended operating hours, stronger value platforms, and faster, more accurate service through innovative order taking. With operational and financial discipline, we will execute these priorities to increase McDonald's brand relevance. We will continue to build customer trust through our commitment to sustainabilityincluding nutrition and well-being, a sustainable supply chain, environmental responsibility, employee experience, and the community. U.S. In 2013, the U.S. business will focus on driving sales and guest counts by enhancing the entire customer experience through the pillars of the Plan and the three global priorities. Our menu pipeline is more balanced in 2013, with a continued focus on great taste, quality ingredients and variety. We will satisfy our customers' needs with the food they crave by balancing core favorites with limited time offers and innovative new products across the menu. Menu news will be augmented with brand messages that highlight our quality food ingredients, efforts around promoting children's well-being and community involvement. We will enhance our Dollar Menu and introduce new products to highlight McDonald's value at every price point, across all menu categories. We are continuing our major remodel program by updating about 800 locations in 2013. At the same time, we are continuing to improve 12 McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report restaurant operations through appropriate staffing and a focus on friendly, accurate service as well as innovative order taking. In addition, we will increase the number of restaurants that operate 24 hours a day and strive to be our customers' favorite eating-out destination. Europe In Europe, we see growth opportunities in breakfast, core menu items, beverages, and extended hours. Our business plans are focused on building market share by emphasizing value across all dayparts and new restaurant growth. In some markets, our value offerings will evolve from a low-end entry price to multiple entry prices across our menu. This value menu evolution is intended to grow guest counts with compelling affordability and enhanced trade-up opportunities through an extended range of options. In 2013, we will reimage approximately 450 restaurants as we progress towards our goal of having 100% of our interiors and over 85% of our exteriors reimaged by the end of 2015. We will also open nearly 300 restaurants. We will leverage production and service enhancements by optimizing kitchen platforms and accelerating the deployment of technologies, such as updating the point-of-sale system and rolling out multiple order points via self-order kiosks, hand-held order devices and side-by-side drive-thrus. These initiatives will enhance the customer experience, help drive guest counts and improve labor efficiency. We will also continue to reduce our impact on the environment with energy management tools. Despite the near-term headwinds due to economic uncertainty and government-initiated austerity measures implemented in many countries, Europe offers significant long-term opportunity, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on this segment's potential. APMEA In APMEA, we will advance efforts to become our customers' favorite place and way to eat and drink by reinvigorating our long-term value platforms, accelerating growth at breakfast, and focusing on menu variety and convenience. Value will continue to be a key strategy and growth driver to build traffic with a focus across the menu at all dayparts, combined with trade-up strategies to build average check. For example, Australia will evolve its Loose Change Menu, and Japan will focus on building average check through trade-up opportunities with promotional products and a focus on breakfast. We plan to grow breakfast traffic in APMEA through increased marketing efforts, value, accessibility and operations excellence. The markets will continue to balance core and limited-time offers and will execute a series of exciting food events that celebrate our core menu and the segment's all-time favorite product offerings. At the same time, we will continue to leverage the diversity of the segment to identify and scale new products and platforms. Convenience initiatives will focus on optimizing our drive-thru and delivery services through operation efficiencies and online capabilities. In China, for example, a new web-ordering system will enhance the customer experience and drive new demand through delivery. We will grow our business by opening approximately 850 new restaurants and reimaging about 225 existing restaurants while elevating our focus on service and operations. In China, we will continue to build a foundation for long-term growth by opening over 300 restaurants, consistent with our goal of reaching 2,000 restaurants by the end of 2013. Consolidated Globally, we will maintain financial discipline by effectively managing spending. In making capital allocation decisions, our goal is to make investments that elevate the McDonald's experience and drive sustainable growth in sales and market share. We focus on markets that generate acceptable returns or have opportunities for long-term growth. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) to shareholders over the long-term via dividends and share repurchases. McDonald's does not provide specific guidance on diluted earnings per share. The following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Company's results: ##TABLE_START  Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 2.5 percentage points to 2013 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 1,135 net traditional restaurants added in 2012. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would increase annual diluted earnings per share by about 4 cents. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  With about 75% of McDonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company's commodity costs. For the full year 2013, the total basket of goods cost is expected to increase 1.5-2.5% in the U.S. and 3-4% in Europe. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects full-year 2013 selling, general and administrative expenses to increase approximately 2-3% in constant currencies, with fluctuations expected between the quarters. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2013 to increase approximately 4-6% compared with 2012. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  A significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 35% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 65% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 25 cents. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2013 to be 31% to 33%. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. As a result of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, our income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 will include a tax benefit of about $50 million reflecting the retroactive impact of certain tax benefits, which may result in a first quarter effective tax rate below the full year range. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects capital expenditures for 2013 to be approximately $3.2 billion. Over half of this amount will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open between 1,500 - 1,600 restaurants including about 500 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets, such as Japan and Latin America, where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of between 1,200 - 1,300 traditional restaurants. The remaining capital will be used to reinvest in existing locations, in part through reimaging. More than 1,600 restaurants worldwide are expected to be reimaged, including locations in affiliated and developmental licensee markets that require no capital investment from the Company. ##TABLE_END McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 13 Consolidated Operating Results ##TABLE_START Operating results           Dollars in millions, except per share data  Amount  Increase/ (decrease)   Amount  Increase/ (decrease)   Amount Revenues             Sales by Company-operated restaurants  $ 18,603  %   $ 18,293  %   $ 16,233 Revenues from franchised restaurants  8,964    8,713    7,842 Total revenues  27,567    27,006    24,075 Operating costs and expenses             Company-operated restaurant expenses  15,224    14,838    13,060 Franchised restaurants-occupancy expenses  1,527    1,481    1,378 Selling, general  administrative expenses  2,455    2,394    2,333 Impairment and other charges (credits), net   nm   (4 )  nm   Other operating (income) expense, net  (252 )  (8 )   (233 )  (18 )   (198 ) Total operating costs and expenses  18,962    18,476    16,602 Operating income  8,605    8,530    7,473 Interest expense        Nonoperating (income) expense, net   (64 )      Income before provision for income taxes  8,079    8,012    7,000 Provision for income taxes  2,614    2,509    2,054 Net income  $ 5,465  (1 %)   $ 5,503  %   $ 4,946 Earnings per common sharediluted  $ 5.36  %   $ 5.27  %   $ 4.58 Weighted-average common shares outstanding diluted  1,020.2  (2 %)   1,044.9  (3 %)   1,080.3 ##TABLE_ENDnm Not meaningful IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonalds mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2012, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results primarily due to the weaker Euro, along with most other currencies. In 2011, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by the stronger Euro and Australian Dollar, as well as most other currencies. In 2010, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by stronger global currencies, primarily the Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, partly offset by the weaker Euro.

Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.17 per share on diluted earnings per share. Net income and diluted earnings per share growth in constant currencies were positively impacted by growth in franchised margin dollars, partly offset by a higher effective income tax rate and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. A decrease of 2% in diluted weighted average shares outstanding also contributed to the diluted earnings per share growth in 2012. In 2011, net income increased 11% (7% in constant currencies) to $5.5 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 15% (11% in constant currencies) to $5.27. Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $0.19 per share on diluted earnings per share. Net income and diluted earnings per share growth in 2011 in constant currencies were positively impacted by growth in franchised margin dollars, and to a lesser extent, Company-operated margin dollars, partly offset by a higher effective income tax rate. A decrease of 3% in diluted weighted average shares outstanding also contributed to the diluted earnings per share growth in 2011. The Company repurchased 28.1 million shares of its stock for $2.6 billion in 2012 and 41.9 million shares of its stock for $3.4 billion in 2011 , driving reductions in weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods. ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_ENDREVENUES The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. In 2012 and 2011 , constant currency revenue growth was driven primarily by positive comparable sales as well as expansion. ##TABLE_START Revenues   Amount   Increase/(decrease)   Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation  Dollars in millions        Company-operated sales:               U.S.  $ 4,530  $ 4,433  $ 4,229  %  %  %  % Europe  7,850  7,852  6,932     APMEA  5,350  5,061  4,297     Other Countries  Corporate     (8 )   (7 )  Total  $ 18,603  $ 18,293  $ 16,233  %  %  %  % Franchised revenues:               U.S.  $ 4,284  $ 4,096  $ 3,883  %  %  %  % Europe  2,977  3,034  2,637  (2 )    APMEA  1,041       Other Countries  Corporate        Total  $ 8,964  $ 8,713  $ 7,842  %  %  %  % Total revenues:               U.S.  $ 8,814  $ 8,529  $ 8,112  %  %  %  % Europe  10,827  10,886  9,569  (1 )    APMEA  6,391  6,019  5,066     Other Countries  Corporate  1,535  1,572  1,328  (2 )    Total  $ 27,567  $ 27,006  $ 24,075  %  %  %  %                ##TABLE_ENDIn the U.S., the increase in revenues in 2012 was primarily due to positive comparable sales. Everyday value offerings, menu variety and the enhanced customer experience due to reimaging contributed positively to results, despite broad competitive activity. Revenues in 2011 were positively impacted by the ongoing appeal of our iconic core products and the success of new products, including additions to the McCaf beverage line, as well as continued focus on everyday value, convenience and modernizing the customer experience. Europes constant currency increases in revenues in 2012 and 2011 were primarily driven by positive comparable sales in the U.K. and Russia, the segment's two largest Company-operated restaurant markets, as well as expansion in Russia. Revenues in 2011 also benefited from comparable sales increases in France and Germany. In APMEA, the constant currency increase in revenues in 2012 was driven by positive comparable sales in China, Australia and many other markets. The constant currency increase in revenues in 2011 was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in China and most other markets. Expansion, primarily in China, also contributed to revenue growth in both periods.

Franchised margin dollars increased  $205 million or 3% ( 6% in constant currencies) in 2012 and $768 million or 12% ( 9% in constant currencies) in 2011 .

The increase in 2011 was primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher occupancy expenses. In Europe, the franchised margin percent decrease in 2012 reflected positive comparable sales and higher occupancy costs. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher occupancy expenses. 16 McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report In APMEA, the franchised margin percent decrease in 2012 was primarily due to Australia, which was partly impacted by the 2012 change in classification of certain amounts from revenues to restaurant occupancy expenses. Although the change in classification resulted in a decrease to the franchised margin percentage, there was no impact on the reported franchised margin dollars. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to a contractual escalation in the royalty rate for Japan in addition to positive comparable sales in most markets, partly offset by a negative impact from the strengthening of the Australian dollar. The franchised margin percent in APMEA and Other Countries  Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. ##TABLE_START  Company-operated margins ##TABLE_END Company-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company-operated margin dollars decreased $76 million or 2% (increased 1% in constant currencies) in 2012, and increased $282 million or 9% (5% in constant currencies) in 2011. In 2012, Company-operated margin dollars were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of $97 million, primarily in Europe. On a constant currency basis, the increase in Company-operated margin dollars was due to positive performance in Europe, offset by lower results in APMEA and the U.S. as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher costs. The growth in Company-operated margin dollars in 2011 was driven by positive comparable sales partly offset by higher costs, primarily commodity costs, in all segments. Foreign currency translation also had a positive impact on results.

The margin percent decreased in 2011 due to higher commodity and occupancy costs, partly offset by positive comparable sales. Europes Company-operated margin percent decreased in 2012 primarily due to higher labor and commodity costs across several markets, despite positive comparable sales in Russia and the U.K. The margin percent decreased in 2011 as higher commodity, labor, and occupancy costs were partly offset by positive comparable sales. In APMEA, the Company-operated margin percent in 2012 decreased primarily due to higher labor and occupancy costs, partly offset by positive comparable sales. The margin percent decreased in 2011 as higher commodity, labor and occupancy costs were partly offset by positive comparable sales. Acceleration of new restaurant openings in China negatively impacted the margin percent in both periods. Similar to other markets, new restaurants in China initially open with lower margins that grow significantly over time. Supplemental information regarding Company-operated restaurants We continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve these goals, but as previously stated, Company-operated restaurants are also important to our success. We report results for Company-operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs. We report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company-operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company-operated restaurants generally include gains/losses on sales of restaurant businesses and write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. We believe the following information about Company-operated restaurants in our most significant segments provides an additional perspective on this business. Management of the Company considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix, subject to other relevant considerations. The following table seeks to illustrate the two components of our Company-operated margins. The first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations, which we refer to as Store operating margin. The second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties. We refer to this component as Brand/real estate margin. Both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties, although rent and royalties for Company-operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation. Rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales, and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of McDonalds investment in the restaurant. Royalty rates may also vary by market. As shown in the following table, in disaggregating the components of our Company-operated margins, certain costs with respect to Company-operated restaurants are reflected in Brand/real estate margin. Those costs consist of rent payable by McDonalds to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy  other operating expenses recorded in the Consolidated statement of income. Store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses, and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating Brand/real estate margin. While we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our Company-operated business, it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In particular, as noted previously, we do not allocate selling, general and administrative expenses to our Company-operated business. However, we believe that about $50,000 per restaurant, on average, is the typical cost to support this business in the U.S. The actual costs in markets outside the U.S. will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market. These costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant.

McDonalds share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. is reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants.

Impairment charges in 2010 also positively impacted the constant currency growth rate for 2011 by 4 percentage points. ##TABLE_START  Combined operating margin ##TABLE_END Combined operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. Combined operating margin for 2012, 2011 and 2010 was 31.2%, 31.6% and 31.0%, respectively.  McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 19 INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased 5% and 9% in 2012 and 2011, respectively, primarily due to higher average debt balances, partly offset by lower average interest rates.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the reported effective income tax rates were 32.4% , 31.3% and 29.3%, respectively. In 2012, the effective income tax rate reflected the negative impact of certain tax benefits in the U.S. that had expired at December 31, 2011. In January 2013, the United States enacted the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (\"Act\"). The Act reinstated, retroactive to January 1, 2012, certain tax benefits that had previously expired. However, in accordance with the financial accounting standards for income taxes, the Company is required to account for the effects of changes in tax laws in the period the legislation is enacted. In 2011, the effective income tax rate reflected lower tax benefits related to certain foreign tax credits, partially offset by nonrecurring deferred tax benefits related to certain foreign operations. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.5 billion in 2012 and 2011. Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets. ACCOUNTING CHANGES ##TABLE_START  Fair value measurements ##TABLE_END In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued an update to Topic 820  Fair Value Measurement of the Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\"). This update provides guidance on how fair value accounting should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards and does not extend the use of fair value accounting. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2012, as required, and it did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.  ##TABLE_START  Comprehensive Income ##TABLE_END In June 2011, the FASB issued an update to Topic 220  Comprehensive Income of the ASC. The update is intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in the financial statements. The guidance requires that the Company presents components of comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements. The Company adopted this new guidance in 2012, as required, and included a separate Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START Cash Flows  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $7.0 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $3.9 billion in 2012, while cash provided by operations totaled $7.2 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.4 billion in 2011. In 2012, cash provided by operations decreased $184 million or 3% compared with 2011 despite increased operating results, primarily due to higher income tax payments and the negative impact of foreign currency translation on operating results. In 2011, cash provided by operations increased $808 million or 13% compared with 2010 primarily due to higher operating results. Cash used for investing activities totaled $3.2 billion in 2012, an increase of $596 million compared with 2011. The increase primarily reflected higher capital expenditures, an increase in other investing activities related to short-term time deposits, and lower proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.6 billion in 2011, an increase of $515 million compared with 2010. This reflected higher capital expenditures, partly offset by higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses. Cash used for financing activities totaled $3.8 billion in 2012, a decrease of $683 million compared with 2011, primarily due to lower treasury stock purchases and higher net debt issuances, partly offset by higher dividend payments. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.5 billion in 2011, an increase of $804 million compared with 2010, primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases, higher dividend payments and lower proceeds from stock option exercises, partly offset by higher net debt issuances. The Companys cash and equivalents balance was $2.3 billion at year end 2012 and 2011. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In 2012, the Company opened 1,404 traditional restaurants and 35 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 269 traditional restaurants and 200 satellite restaurants. In 2011, the Company opened 1,118 traditional restaurants and 32 satellite restaurants, and closed 246 traditional restaurants and 131 satellite restaurants. The majority of restaurant openings and closings occurred in the major markets in both years. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.

Over 80% of the restaurants at year-end 2012 were franchised. Capital expenditures increased $319 million or 12% in 2012, and increased $595 million or 28% in 2011, primarily due to higher reinvestment in existing restaurants and higher investment in new restaurants. The higher reinvestment reflects the Company's commitment to grow sales through initiatives such as reimaging in many markets around the world. The increase related to new restaurants reflects our commitment to broaden accessibility to our brand. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented about 70% of the total in 2012, 2011 and 2010. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.

Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $2.9 million in 2012. The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2012 and 2011. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS For the last three years, the Company returned a total of $16.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Shares repurchased and dividends  ##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data   Number of shares repurchased 28.1  41.9  37.8 Shares outstanding at year end 1,003  1,021  1,054 Dividends declared per share $ 2.87  $ 2.53  $ 2.26       Treasury stock purchases (in Shareholders' equity) $ 2,605  $ 3,373  $ 2,648 Dividends paid 2,897  2,610  2,408 Total returned to shareholders $ 5,502  $ 5,983  $ 5,056 ##TABLE_ENDIn September 2009, the Companys Board of Directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date (\"2009 Program\"). As most of the amount authorized under the 2009 Program was utilized, the Companys Board of Directors terminated the 2009 Program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program, effective August 1, 2012, that authorizes the purchase of up to $10 billion of the Companys outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. In 2012, approximately 8.4 million shares were repurchased for $ 748 million under the new program. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 37 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2012 full year dividend of $ 2.87 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.70 per share, with an increase to $0.77 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 10% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $3.08 per share annual dividend and reflects the Companys confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors. ##TABLE_START Financial Position and Capital Resources  ##TABLE_ENDTOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS Total assets increased $2.4 billion or 7% in 2012. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $2.0 billion in 2012. Over 75% of total assets were in major markets at year-end 2012. Net property and equipment increased $1.8 billion in 2012 and represented about 70% of total assets at year end. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net property and equipment increased $1.4 billion primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation. Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. ##TABLE_START    Return on average assets 25.4 %  26.0 %  24.7 % Return on average common equity 37.5  37.7  35.3 ##TABLE_ENDIn 2012, return on average assets and return on average common equity decreased due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation primarily on operating income and net income. In 2011, return on average assets and return on average common equity benefited from strong global operating results and the positive impact of foreign currency translation. Operating income, as reported, does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about two percentage points for all years presented.  McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 21 FINANCING AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2012 totaled $13.6 billion, compared with $12.5 billion at December 31, 2011. The net increase in 2012 was primarily due to net issuances of $1.2 billion.

Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Under existing authorization from the Companys Board of Directors, at December 31, 2012, the Company had $5.4 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $1.5 billion available under committed line of credit agreements as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K). Debt maturing in 2013 is approximately $690 million of long-term corporate debt. In 2013, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. As of December 31, 2012, the Company also had $581 million of foreign currency borrowings outstanding primarily under uncommitted line of credit agreements. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $4.9 billion and $5.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Companys restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2012, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position. The Companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures ##TABLE_START In millions of U.S. Dollars  Euro $ 6,692  $ 5,905 Australian Dollars 2,450  2,409 Canadian Dollars 1,319  1,224 British Pounds Sterling 1,117  Russian Ruble  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2012 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2012 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. LIQUIDITY The Company has significant operations outside the United States where we earn over 60% of our operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company 22 McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. Accordingly, no U.S. federal or state income taxes have been provided on the undistributed foreign earnings. The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2012 . We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds. Consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities. In the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the United States than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future. While the likelihood is remote, to the extent foreign cash is available, the Company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits) which could result in a use of cash. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. Refer to the Income Taxes note to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Companys borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2012. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further details. ##TABLE_START  Contractual cash outflows   Contractual cash inflows  In millions Operating leases   Debt obligations (1)   Minimum rent under franchise arrangements   $ 1,352      $ 2,562  1,259   $   2,484  1,130   1,168   2,382  1,020   2,437   2,261    1,053   2,130 Thereafter  6,844   8,273   17,047 Total  $ 12,523   $ 13,590   $ 28,866 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The maturities reflect reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $1.5 billion, as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in November 2016. Debt obligations do not include $42 million of noncash fair value hedging adjustments or $217 million of accrued interest. ##TABLE_ENDThe Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of IRS limitations. At December 31, 2012, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $493 million, and total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $482 million . There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. The amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the Companys financial position. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows. ##TABLE_START Other Matters  ##TABLE_ENDCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: ##TABLE_START  Property and equipment ##TABLE_END Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. ##TABLE_START  Share-based compensation ##TABLE_END The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Companys stock over the expected  McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 23 life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. ##TABLE_START  Long-lived assets impairment review ##TABLE_END Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Companys experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Companys estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual country) with goodwill currently at risk of impairment. ##TABLE_START  Litigation accruals ##TABLE_END In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. ##TABLE_START  Income taxes ##TABLE_END The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. In 2012, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") completed its examination of the Company's U.S. federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. The Company and the IRS reached an agreement on adjustments that had been previously proposed by the IRS. The agreement did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows, results of operations or financial position. The Company's 2009 and 2010 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the field examination is expected in 2013. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $14.8 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management's intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICESINFLATION The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. RECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL ROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Companys incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period. The denominator is the weighted-average cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. The weighted-average cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarters investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2012 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2012 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2011 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full-year impact on 2012 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2011 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows: 24 McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report One-year ROIIC calculation (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Incremental change  NUMERATOR:       Operating income $ 8,604.6  $ 8,529.7   $ 74.9 Depreciation and amortization 1,488.5  1,415.0   73.5 Currency translation (1)      286.1 Incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 434.5 DENOMINATOR:       Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (2)      $ 2,826.3 Currency translation (1)      3.0 Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 2,829.3 One-year ROIIC      15.4 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Represents one-year weighted-average cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the cash used for investing activities for each quarter in the two-year period ended December 31, 2012 . ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,     Cash used for investing activities  $ 3,167.3  $ 2,570.9 AS A PERCENT     Quarters ended:     March 31  87.5 %  12.5 % June 30  62.5  37.5 September 30  37.5  62.5 December 31  12.5  87.5 ##TABLE_ENDThree-year ROIIC calculation (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Incremental change  NUMERATOR:       Operating income $ 8,604.6  $ 6,841.0   $ 1,763.6 Depreciation and amortization 1,488.5  1,216.2   272.3 Currency translation (3)      (65.3 ) Incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 1,970.6 DENOMINATOR:       Weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities (4)      $ 6,959.1 Currency translation (3)      (70.0 ) Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 6,889.1 Three-year ROIIC      28.6 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Represents three-year weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the adjusted cash used for investing activities for each quarter in the four-year period ended December 31, 2012 . ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Years ended December 31,    2011 2009 Cash used for investing activities  $ 3,167.3 $ 2,570.9 $ 2,056.0 $ 1,655.3 Less: Cash generated from investing activities related to Redbox transaction     (144.9 ) Adjusted cash used for investing activities  $ 3,167.3 $ 2,570.9 $ 2,056.0 $ 1,800.2 AS A PERCENT      Quarters ended:      March 31  87.5 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 12.5 % June 30  62.5 100.0 100.0 37.5 September 30  37.5 100.0 100.0 62.5 December 31  12.5 100.0 100.0 87.5 ##TABLE_END McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 25 RISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook for 2013 .

McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 31 ##TABLE_START Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  ##TABLE_ENDSummary of Significant Accounting Policies NATURE OF BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants in the global restaurant industry. All restaurants are operated either by the Company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchise arrangements, and foreign affiliates and developmental licensees under license agreements. The following table presents restaurant information by ownership type: ##TABLE_START Restaurants at December 31,   Conventional franchised 19,869  19,527  19,279 Developmental licensed 4,350  3,929  3,485 Foreign affiliated 3,663  3,619  3,574 Franchised 27,882  27,075  26,338 Company-operated 6,598  6,435  6,399 Systemwide restaurants 34,480  33,510  32,737 ##TABLE_ENDThe results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees were not material either individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale. CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily McDonalds Japan) are accounted for by the equity method. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers, and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the variable interest entity consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented. ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and foreign affiliates. Sales by Company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis. The Company presents sales net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and may include initial fees. Continuing rent and royalties are recognized in the period earned. Initial fees are recognized upon opening of a restaurant or granting of a new franchise term, which is when the Company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise arrangement. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Generally, the functional currency of operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency. ADVERTISING COSTS Advertising costs included in operating expenses of Company-operated restaurants primarily consist of contributions to advertising cooperatives and were (in millions): 2012  $787.5 ; 2011  $768.6 ; 2010  $687.0 . Production costs for radio and television advertising are expensed when the commercials are initially aired. These production costs, primarily in the U.S., as well as other marketing-related expenses included in Selling, general  administrative expenses were (in millions): 2012  $113.5 ; 2011  $74.4 ; 2010  $94.5 . Costs related to the Olympics sponsorship are included in these expenses for 2012 and 2010. In addition, significant advertising costs are incurred by franchisees through contributions to advertising cooperatives in individual markets. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Share-based compensation includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value. Share-based compensation expense and the effect on diluted earnings per common share were as follows: ##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data   Share-based compensation expense $ 93.4  $ 86.2  $ 83.1 After tax $ 63.2  $ 59.2  $ 56.2 Earnings per common share-diluted $ 0.06  $ 0.05  $ 0.05 ##TABLE_ENDCompensation expense related to share-based awards is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in Selling, general  administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2012 , there was $94.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for the 2012 , 2011 and 2010 stock option grants. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical trends. Expected stock price volatility is generally based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock for a period approximating the expected life. The expected dividend yield is based on the Companys most recent annual dividend rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life.  Weighted-average assumptions ##TABLE_START  2011 Expected dividend yield 2.8 % 3.2 % 3.5 % Expected stock price volatility 20.8 % 21.5 % 22.1 % Risk-free interest rate 1.1 % 2.8 % 2.8 % Expected life of options In years 6.1 6.3 6.2 Fair value per option granted $ 13.65 $ 12.18 $ 9.90 ##TABLE_ENDPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildingsup to 40 years; leasehold improvements the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms , which generally include option periods; and equipment three to 12 years. 32 McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurant businesses. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of McDonald's restaurants from franchisees and ownership increases in subsidiaries or affiliates, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit (defined as each individual country). The Company conducts goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever an indicator of impairment exists. If an indicator of impairment exists (e.g., estimated earnings multiple value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value), the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit, generally based on discounted future cash flows, with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the carrying amount of goodwill. Historically, goodwill impairment has not significantly impacted the consolidated financial statements.

For purposes of annually reviewing McDonalds restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together at a television market level in the U.S. and at a country level for each of the international markets. The Company manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurants cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment (e.g., negative operating cash flows for the most recent trailing 24 -month period) exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows. Losses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal, the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses relate to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered available for sale. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, and certain non-financial assets and liabilities on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value disclosures are reflected in a three-level hierarchy, maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: ##TABLE_START  Level 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for an identical asset or liability in an active market. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for a similar asset or liability in an active market or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END Certain of the Companys derivatives are valued using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate observable market parameters, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates, classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. Derivative valuations incorporate credit risk adjustments that are necessary to reflect the probability of default by the counterparty or the Company.

For the year ended December 31, 2012 , no material fair value adjustments or fair value measurements were required for non-financial assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_START  Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2012 , the fair value of the Companys debt obligations was estimated at $15.6 billion , compared to a carrying amount of $13.6 billion . The fair value was based on quoted market prices, Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. The carrying amount for both cash equivalents and notes receivable approximate fair value. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt and derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of these changes. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. The Company documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions, as well as all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items. The Companys derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments consist mainly of interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards and foreign currency options, cross-currency swaps, and commodity forwards, further explained in the \"Fair Value,\" \"Cash Flow\" and \"Net Investment\" hedge sections. The Company also enters into certain derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments. The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Selling, general  administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Since these derivatives are not designated for hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in nonoperating (income) expense together with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. A portion of the Companys foreign currency options (more fully described in the \"Cash Flow Hedges\" section) are undesignated as hedging instruments as the underlying foreign currency royalties are earned. All derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments are classified as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. All derivatives (including those not designated for hedge accounting) are recognized on the Consolidated balance sheet at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity dates. Changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments are reflected as adjustments to other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") and/or current earnings.  34 McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report The following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included on the Consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 : ##TABLE_START  Derivative Assets  Derivative Liabilities In millions Balance Sheet Classification    Balance Sheet Classification   Derivatives designated as hedging instruments         Foreign currency Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $ 5.0  $ 6.7  Accrued payroll and other liabilities  $ (3.5 )  $ (0.3 ) Interest rate Prepaid expenses and other current assets  4.2  9.4       Commodity Miscellaneous other assets  35.3   Other long-term liabilities  (0.2 )  Foreign currency Miscellaneous other assets  2.5  0.7  Other long-term liabilities  (32.1 )  (0.3 ) Interest rate Miscellaneous other assets  38.1  46.0  Other long-term liabilities   (14.0 ) Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments  $ 85.1  $ 62.8    $ (35.8 )  $ (14.6 ) Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments         Equity Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $ 132.3        Foreign currency Prepaid expenses and other current assets  1.0  $ 8.3  Accrued payroll and other liabilities  $ (6.8 )  $ (1.0 ) Equity Miscellaneous other assets   154.5       Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments  $ 133.3  $ 162.8    $ (6.8 )  $ (1.0 ) Total derivatives  $ 218.4  $ 225.6    $ (42.6 )  $ (15.6 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe following table presents the pretax amounts affecting income and OCI for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively: ##TABLE_START In millions                   Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships  Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivative  Hedged Items in Fair Value Hedging Relationships  Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income on Related Hedged Items                         Interest rate   $ (13.0 )  $ (11.1 )  Fixed-rate debt   $ 13.0     $ 11.1                       Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships  Gain (Loss) Recognized in Accumulated OCI on Derivative (Effective Portion)  Gain (Loss) Reclassified into Income from Accumulated OCI (Effective Portion)  Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivative (Amount Excluded from Effectiveness Testing and Ineffective Portion)                       Commodity   $ 35.1           Foreign currency   (6.4 )  $ (5.1 )   $ (15.8 )  $ (5.1 )   $ (12.3 )     $ (7.7 ) Interest rate (1)   (4.6 )  (14.0 )   0.5  2.2       Total   $ 24.1  $ (19.1 )   $ (15.3 )  $ (2.9 )   $ (12.3 )    $ (7.7 )                            Gain (Loss) Recognized in Accumulated OCI on Derivative (Effective Portion)  Gain (Loss) Reclassified into Income from Accumulated OCI (Effective Portion)  Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments  Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivative Net Investment Hedging Relationships                                        Foreign Currency   $ (13.4 )  $ (2.2 ) Foreign currency denominated debt   $ (61.7 )  $ (130.8 )     Equity (3)   (16.2 )  36.9 Foreign currency derivatives (2)   (23.3 )  (9.4 )    $ (8.2 )  Interest Rate    1.5 Total   $ (85.0 )  $ (140.2 )    $ (8.2 )  Total   $ (29.6 )  $ 36.2                       Gains (losses) recognized in income on derivatives are recorded in Nonoperating (income) expense, net unless otherwise noted.

(2) The amount of gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated OCI into income is recorded in Impairment and other charges (credits), net. (3) The amount of gain (loss) recognized in income on the derivatives used to hedge the supplemental benefit plan liabilities is recorded in Selling, general  administrative expenses. ##TABLE_END McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 35 ##TABLE_START  Fair Value Hedges ##TABLE_END The Company enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure to changes in the fair values of certain liabilities. The fair value hedges the Company enters into consist of interest rate swaps which convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt. All of the Companys interest rate swaps meet the shortcut method requirements. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying debt. No ineffectiveness has been recorded to net income related to interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the year ended December 31, 2012 . A total of $1.8 billion of the Companys outstanding fixed-rate debt was effectively converted to floating-rate debt resulting from the use of interest rate swaps. ##TABLE_START  Cash Flow Hedges ##TABLE_END The Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. The types of cash flow hedges the Company enters into include interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, foreign currency options, cross currency swaps, and commodity forwards. The Company periodically uses interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of floating-rate debt, including forecasted debt issuances, into fixed-rate debt and the agreements are intended to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies), the Company uses foreign currency forwards and foreign currency options to hedge a portion of anticipated exposures. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the decline in value of future foreign denominated royalties is offset by gains in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards and/or foreign currency options. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in the value of future foreign denominated royalties is offset by losses in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards and/or foreign currency options. Although the fair value changes in the foreign currency options may fluctuate over the period of the contract, the Companys total loss on a foreign currency option is limited to the upfront premium paid for the contract; however, the potential gains on a foreign currency option are unlimited. In some situations, the Company uses foreign currency collars, which limit the potential gains and lower the upfront premium paid, to protect against currency movements. The hedges cover the next 19 months for certain exposures and are denominated in various currencies. As of December 31, 2012 , the Company had derivatives outstanding with an equivalent notional amount of $626.9 million that were used to hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency denominated royalties. The Company excludes the time value of foreign currency options from its effectiveness assessment on its cash flow hedges. As a result, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to this component, as well as the ineffectiveness of the hedges, are recognized in earnings currently. The effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is reported in the cash flow hedging component of OCI in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the risk of cash flows associated with certain foreign-currency denominated debt, including forecasted interest payments, and has elected cash flow hedge accounting. The hedges cover periods up to 59 months and have an equivalent notional amount of $245.8 million . The Company manages its exposure to the variability of cash flows for energy-related transactions in certain markets by entering into commodity forwards and has elected cash flow hedge accounting as appropriate. The hedges cover periods up to 22 years and have an equivalent notional amount of $493.8 million . The Company recorded after tax adjustments to the cash flow hedging component of accumulated OCI in shareholders equity. The Company recorded a net increase of $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 and a net decrease of $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 . Based on interest rates and foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2012 , the $35.2 million in cumulative cash flow hedging gains , after tax, at December 31, 2012 , is not expected to have a significant effect on earnings over the next 12 months. ##TABLE_START  Net Investment Hedges ##TABLE_END The Company primarily uses foreign currency denominated debt (third party and intercompany) to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders equity in the foreign currency translation component of OCI and offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in OCI. As of December 31, 2012 , $7.7 billion of intercompany foreign currency denominated debt, $4.0 billion of the Companys third party foreign currency denominated debt and $528.6 million of derivatives were designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. ##TABLE_START  Credit Risk ##TABLE_END The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its hedging instruments. The counterparties to these agreements consist of a diverse group of financial institutions and market participants. The Company continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and adjusts positions as appropriate. The Company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2012 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. For financial reporting purposes, the Company presents gross derivative balances in the financial statements and supplementary data, even for counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2012 , neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where its counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions. INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES The Company, like other multi-national companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. Accordingly, tax liabilities are recorded when, in managements judgment, a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may still be recorded depending on managements assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled. The Company records interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.  36 McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION Diluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of shares): 2012  10.1 ; 2011  12.8 ; 2010  14.3 . Stock options that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutive were (in millions of shares): 2012  4.7 ; 2011  0.0 ; 2010  0.0 . The Company has elected to exclude the pro forma deferred tax asset associated with share-based compensation in earnings per share. STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS The Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). There were no subsequent events that required recognition or disclosure. ##TABLE_START Comprehensive Income  ##TABLE_ENDIn June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued an update to Topic 220  Comprehensive Income of the Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\"). The update is intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in the financial statements. The guidance requires that the Company presents components of comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements. The Company adopted this new guidance in 2012, as required, and included a separate Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. ##TABLE_START Property and Equipment  ##TABLE_ENDNet property and equipment consisted of: ##TABLE_START In millions December 31, 2012   Land  $ 5,612.6  $ 5,328.3 Buildings and improvements on owned land  14,089.0  13,079.9 Buildings and improvements on leased land  12,970.8  12,021.8 Equipment, signs and seating  5,241.0  4,757.2 Other  577.7  550.4   38,491.1  35,737.6 Accumulated depreciation and amortization  (13,813.9 )  (12,903.1 ) Net property and equipment  $ 24,677.2  $ 22,834.5 ##TABLE_ENDDepreciation and amortization expense was (in millions): 2012  $1,402.2 ; 2011  $1,329.6 ; 2010  $1,200.4 . ##TABLE_START Impairment and Other Charges (Credits), Net ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START In millions   Europe $ 6.6  $ 0.3  $ 1.6 APMEA  (4.2 )  48.5 Other Countries  Corporate 1.4   (21.0 ) Total $ 8.0  $ (3.9 )  $ 29.1 ##TABLE_ENDIn 2010, the Company recorded expense of $29 million primarily related to its share of restaurant closing costs in McDonalds Japan in conjunction with the strategic review of the markets restaurant portfolio, partly offset by income related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. ##TABLE_START Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START In millions   Gains on sales of restaurant businesses $ (151.5 )  $ (81.8 )  $ (79.4 ) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (143.5 )  (178.0 )  (164.3 ) Asset dispositions and other expense 43.5  26.9  45.5 Total $ (251.5 )  $ (232.9 )  $ (198.2 ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Gains on sales of restaurant businesses ##TABLE_END Gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from sales of Company-operated restaurants. The Companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. ##TABLE_START  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates ##TABLE_END Unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control. The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonalds share of results. For foreign affiliated marketsprimarily Japanresults are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonalds share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. are reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. ##TABLE_START  Asset dispositions and other expense ##TABLE_END Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for restaurant closings and uncollectible receivables, asset write-offs due to restaurant reinvestment, and other miscellaneous income and expenses. ##TABLE_START Contingencies  ##TABLE_ENDIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters.   McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 37 In connection with the sale in 2007 of its businesses in 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to a developmental licensee organization, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims, certain of which are reflected on McDonalds Consolidated balance sheet ( 2012 and 2011 : other long-term liabilities $42.0 million and $49.4 million , respectively; 2012 and 2011 : accrued payroll and other liabilities $0.0 million and $21.2 million , respectively). The Company believes any other matters currently being reviewed will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. ##TABLE_START Franchise Arrangements  ##TABLE_ENDConventional franchise arrangements generally include a lease and a license and provide for payment of initial fees, as well as continuing rent and royalties to the Company based upon a percent of sales with minimum rent payments that parallel the Companys underlying leases and escalations (on properties that are leased). Under this arrangement, franchisees are granted the right to operate a restaurant using the McDonalds System and, in most cases, the use of a restaurant facility, generally for a period of 20 years . These franchisees pay related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. Affiliates and developmental licensees operating under license agreements pay a royalty to the Company based upon a percent of sales, and may pay initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants consisted of: ##TABLE_START In millions   Rents $ 5,863.5  $ 5,718.5  $ 5,198.4 Royalties 3,032.6  2,929.8  2,579.2 Initial fees 68.4  64.9  63.7 Revenues from franchised restaurants $ 8,964.5  $ 8,713.2  $ 7,841.3 ##TABLE_ENDFuture minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements are: ##TABLE_START In millions Owned sites   Leased sites   Total  $ 1,266.0   $ 1,295.7  $ 2,561.7  1,233.6   1,250.3  2,483.9  1,184.3   1,198.2  2,382.5  1,124.2   1,137.0  2,261.2  1,061.7   1,067.9  2,129.6 Thereafter  9,125.9   7,921.0  17,046.9 Total minimum payments  $ 14,995.7   $ 13,870.1  $ 28,865.8 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2012 , net property and equipment under franchise arrangements totaled $14.6 billion (including land of $4.2 billion ) after deducting accumulated depreciation and amortization of $7.6 billion . ##TABLE_START Leasing Arrangements  ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2012 , the Company was the lessee at 14,429 restaurant locations through ground leases (the Company leases the land and the Company or franchisee owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases land and buildings). Lease terms for most restaurants, where market conditions allow, are generally for 20 years and, in many cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options, with certain leases providing purchase options. Escalation terms vary by geographic segment with examples including fixed-rent escalations, escalations based on an inflation index, and fair-value market adjustments. The timing of these escalations generally ranges from annually to every five years. For most locations, the Company is obligated for the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance; however, for franchised sites, the Company requires the franchisees to pay these costs. In addition, the Company is the lessee under noncancelable leases covering certain offices and vehicles.

After considering the deferred tax accounting impact, it is expected that about $360 million of the total as of December 31, 2012 would favorably affect the effective tax rate if resolved in the Companys favor. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START In millions  Balance at January 1 $ 565.0  $ 572.6 Decreases for positions taken in prior years (65.7 )  (50.6 ) Increases for positions taken in prior years 36.9  24.3 Increases for positions related to the current year 47.3  54.8 Settlements with taxing authorities (95.8 )  (14.4 ) Lapsing of statutes of limitations (5.3 )  (21.7 ) Balance at December 31 (1) $ 482.4  $ 565.0 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Of this amount, $481.7 million and $564.3 million are included in long-term liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheet for 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The remainder is included in deferred income taxes on the Consolidated balance sheet. ##TABLE_END In December 2012, the Company reached a final settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") Appeals Division regarding its U.S. federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. The Company agreed to a settlement of about $80 million , primarily related to proposed foreign tax credit adjustments of about $400 million . The liabilities previously recorded and determined in accordance with ASC 740 - Income Taxes related to this matter were adequate. Additionally, no cash payment was made related to this settlement as the Company had previously made a tax deposit with the IRS. The agreement did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows, results of operations or financial position. The Company's 2009 and 2010 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under examination. Additionally, the Company is currently under audit in multiple state and foreign tax jurisdictions where it is reasonably possible that the audits could be completed within 12 months. Due to the possible completion of these audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next 12 months by $150 million to $160 million , of which $10 million to $30 million could favorably affect the effective tax rate. In addition, the Company is currently under audit in multiple tax jurisdictions where completion of the tax audits is not expected within 12 months. However, it is reasonably possible that, as a result of audit progression within the next 12 months, there may be new information that causes the Company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded. While the Company cannot estimate the impact that new information may have on our unrecognized tax benefit balance, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined under ASC 740. The Company is generally no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2006. The Company had $37.7 million and $39.6 million accrued for interest and penalties at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalties related to tax matters of $11.2 million in 2012 , $4.8 million in 2011 , and $29.0 million in 2010 , which are included in the provision for income taxes. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. These temporary differences were approximately $14.8 billion at December 31, 2012 and consisted primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. Determination of the deferred income tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.

Fees and interest rates on this line are based on the Companys long-term credit rating assigned by Moodys and Standard  Poors . In addition, the Company, including certain subsidiaries outside the U.S., had unused lines of credit totaling $988.9 million at December 31, 2012 ; these lines of credit were primarily uncommitted, short-term and denominated in various currencies at local market rates of interest . The weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings was 4.1% at December 31, 2012 (based on $581.3 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings and $200.0 million of commercial paper) and 4.6% at December 31, 2011 (based on $640.3 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings and $250.0 million of commercial paper). DEBT OBLIGATIONS The Company has incurred debt obligations principally through public and private offerings and bank loans. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions, and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. Under certain agreements, the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at par or at a premium over par. The Company has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt prior to maturity. ESOP LOANS Borrowings related to the leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") at December 31, 2012 , which include $31.5 million of loans from the Company to the ESOP, are reflected as debt with a corresponding reduction of shareholders equity (additional paid-in capital included a balance of $27.2 million and $34.4 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively). The ESOP is repaying the loans and interest through 2018 using Company contributions and dividends from its McDonalds common stock holdings . As the principal amount of the borrowings is repaid, the debt and the unearned ESOP compensation (additional paid-in capital) are reduced. 40 McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report The following table summarizes the Companys debt obligations.

The related hedging instrument is also recorded at fair value in prepaid expenses and other current assets, miscellaneous other assets or other long-term liabilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) Includes notes payable, current maturities of long-term debt and long-term debt included on the Consolidated balance sheet. The increase in debt obligations from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012 was primarily due to net issuances of $1.2 billion . ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Employee Benefit Plans  ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys Profit Sharing and Savings Plan for U.S.-based employees includes a 401(k) feature, a regular employee match feature, and a discretionary employer profit sharing match. The 401(k) feature allows participants to make pretax contributions that are matched each pay period from shares released under the ESOP. The Profit Sharing and Savings Plan also provides for a discretionary employer profit sharing match after the end of the year for those participants eligible to share in the match. All current account balances and future contributions and related earnings can be invested in several investment alternatives as well as McDonalds common stock in accordance with each participants elections. Participants contributions to the 401(k) feature and the discretionary employer matching contribution feature are limited to 20% investment in McDonalds common stock. Participants may choose to make separate investment choices for current account balances and for future contributions. The Company also maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan because of Internal Revenue Service limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities were $493.5 million at December 31, 2012 , and $482.5 million at December 31, 2011 , and were primarily included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheet. The Company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of the liabilities. At December 31, 2012 , derivatives with a fair value of $132.3 million indexed to the Company's stock and an investment totaling $123.8 million indexed to certain market indices were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated balance sheet. All changes in liabilities for these nonqualified plans and in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Selling, general  administrative expenses. Changes in fair value of the derivatives indexed to the Companys stock are recorded in the income statement because the contracts provide the counterparty with a choice to settle in cash or shares.  Total U.S. costs for the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan, including nonqualified benefits and related hedging activities, were (in millions): 2012  $27.9 ; 2011  $41.3 ; 2010  $51.4 . Certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. also offer profit sharing, stock purchase or other similar benefit plans. Total plan costs outside the U.S. were (in millions): 2012  $62.5 ; 2011  $58.3 ; 2010  $57.6 . The total combined liabilities for international retirement plans were $77.7 million and $125.4 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Other postretirement benefits and post-employment benefits were immaterial.   McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 41 ##TABLE_START Share-based Compensation  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company maintains a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plans was 79.3 million at December 31, 2012 , including 50.1 million available for future grants. STOCK OPTIONS Stock options to purchase common stock are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Companys stock on the date of grant. Substantially all of the options become exercisable in four equal installments, beginning a year from the date of the grant, and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. Options granted between March 21, 2000 and December 31, 2000 (approximately 1.0 million options outstanding at December 31, 2012 ) expire 13 years from the date of grant. Intrinsic value for stock options is defined as the difference between the current market value of the Companys stock and the exercise price. During 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $469.8 million , $416.5 million and $500.8 million , respectively. Cash received from stock options exercised during 2012 was $328.6 million and the actual tax benefit realized for tax deductions from stock options exercised totaled $140.2 million . The Company uses treasury shares purchased under the Companys share repurchase program to satisfy share-based exercises. A summary of the status of the Companys stock option grants as of December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , and changes during the years then ended, is presented in the following table: ##TABLE_START      Options Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price   Weighted- average remaining contractual life in years  Aggregate intrinsic value in millions   Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price   Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price  Outstanding at beginning of year 31.7   $ 47.77       37.4   $ 42.47  47.8   $ 38.16 Granted 4.9   99.63       3.9   75.97  4.5   63.26 Exercised (8.6 )   38.51       (9.0 )   37.46  (13.6 )   33.84 Forfeited/expired (0.6 )   55.28       (0.6 )   55.00  (1.3 )   46.03 Outstanding at end of year 27.4   $ 59.86  5.6   $ 833.0  31.7   $ 47.77  37.4   $ 42.47 Exercisable at end of year 17.1   $ 45.97  4.1   $ 722.1  21.9     26.4    ##TABLE_ENDRSUs RSUs generally vest 100% on the third anniversary of the grant and are payable in either shares of McDonalds common stock or cash, at the Companys discretion.

The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: ##TABLE_START I. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START II. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START III. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ##TABLE_END There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may vary over time. Management assessed the design and effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework. Based on managements assessment using those criteria, as of December 31, 2012 , management believes that the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. Ernst  Young, LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 and the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 . Their reports are presented on the following pages. The independent registered public accountants and internal auditors advise management of the results of their audits, and make recommendations to improve the system of internal controls. Management evaluates the audit recommendations and takes appropriate action. McDONALDS CORPORATION February 25, 2013   44 McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report ##TABLE_START Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  ##TABLE_ENDThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonalds Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McDonalds Corporation as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of McDonalds Corporation at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), McDonalds Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 25, 2013 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. ERNST  YOUNG LLP Chicago, Illinois February 25, 2013  McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 45 ##TABLE_START Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  ##TABLE_ENDThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonalds Corporation We have audited McDonalds Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). McDonalds Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report on Managements Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, McDonalds Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of McDonalds Corporation as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 , and our report dated February 25, 2013 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Business  ##TABLE_ENDMcDonalds Corporation, the registrant, together with its sub-sidiaries, is referred to herein as the Company. a. General development of business During 2013 , there were no material changes to the Companys corporate structure or in its method of conducting business. In 2013 , the Company continued the process it began in 2005 to realign certain subsidiaries to develop a corporate structure within its geographic segments that better reflects the operation of the McDonalds worldwide business. b. Financial information about segments Segment data for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 are included in Part II, Item 8, page 39 of this Form 10-K. c. Narrative description of business ##TABLE_START  General ##TABLE_END The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants in the global restaurant industry. These restaurants serve a broad menu (see Products) at various price points in more than 100 countries around the world. All restaurants are operated either by the Company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchise arrangements, and developmental licensees and foreign affiliated markets under license agreements. The Companys operations are designed to assure consistency and high quality at every restaurant. When granting franchises or licenses, the Company is selective and generally is not in the practice of franchising to passive investors. Under the conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and dcor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. A discussion regarding site selection is included in Part I, Item 2, page 6 of this Form 10-K. Conventional franchisees cont ribute to the Companys revenue stream through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees received upon the opening of a new restaurant or the granting of a new franchise term. The conventional franchise arrangement typically lasts 20 years, and franchising practices are generally consistent throughout the world. Over 70% of franchised restaurants operate under conventional franchise arrangements. Under a developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest. While the Company has no capital invested, it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales, as well as initial fees. The largest of these developmental license arrangements operates nearly 2,100 restaurants across 19 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Company has an equity investment in a limited number of foreign affiliated markets, referred to as \"affiliates.\" The largest of these affiliates is Japan, where there are nearly 3,200 restaurants. The Company receives a royalty based on a percent of sales in these markets and records its share of net results in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. The Company and its franchisees purchase food, packaging, equipment and other goods from numerous independent suppliers. The Company has established and strictly enforces high quality standards and product specifications. The Company has quality centers around the world to ensure that its high standards are consistently met. The quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews, but also on-site supplier visits. A quality leadership board, composed of the Companys technical, safety and supply chain specialists, provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food quality and safety. In addition, the Company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation, assure best practices and drive continuous improvement. Leveraging scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies, the Company also collaborates with suppliers toward a goal of achieving competitive, predictable food and paper costs over the long term. Independently owned and operated distribution centers, approved by the Company, distribute products and supplies to McDonalds restaurants. In addition, restaurant personnel are trained in the proper storage, handling and preparation of products. McDonalds global brand is well known. Marketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed to promote McDonalds brand image and differentiate the Company from competitors. Marketing and promotional efforts focus on value, food taste, menu choice, nutrition, convenience and the customer experience. The Company continuously endeavors to improve its social responsibility and environmental practices to achieve long-term sustainability, which benefits McDonalds and the communities it serves.  ##TABLE_START  Products ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu, although there are geographic variations to suit local consumer preferences and tastes. In addition, McDonalds tests new products on an ongoing basis. McDonalds menu includes hamburgers and cheeseburgers, Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Filet-O-Fish, several chicken sandwiches, Chicken McNuggets, wraps, french fries, salads, oatmeal, shakes, McFlurry desserts, sundaes, soft serve cones, pies, soft drinks, coffee, McCaf beverages and other beverages. In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of other products during limited-time promotions. McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. and many international markets offer a full or limited breakfast menu. Breakfast offerings may include Egg McMuffin, Sausage McMuffin with Egg, McGriddles, biscuit and bagel sandwiches and hotcakes.  ##TABLE_START  Intellectual property ##TABLE_END The Company owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information. The Company considers the trademarks McDonalds and The Golden Arches Logo to be of material importance to its business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. Patents, copyrights and licenses are of varying remaining durations.  ##TABLE_START  Seasonal operations ##TABLE_END The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree.  ##TABLE_START  Working capital practices ##TABLE_END Information about the Companys working capital practices is incorporated herein by reference to Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the  McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report 1 years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 in Part II, Item 7 , pages 10 through 25, and t he Consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 in Part II, Item 8, page 29 of thi s Form 10-K.  ##TABLE_START  Customers ##TABLE_END The Companys business is not dependent upon either a single customer or small group of customers.  ##TABLE_START  Backlog ##TABLE_END Company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders.  ##TABLE_START  Government contracts ##TABLE_END No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government.  ##TABLE_START  Competition ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of food products. The Company competes on the basis of price, convenience, service, menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry. In measuring the Companys competitive position, management reviews data compiled by Euromonitor International, a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry. The Companys primary competition, which management refers to as the informal eating out (\"IEO\") segment, includes the following restaurant categories defined by Euromonitor International: quick-service eating establishments, casual dining full-service restaurants, street stalls or kiosks, cafs,100% home delivery/takeaway providers, specialist coffee shops, self-service cafeterias and juice/smoothie bars. Market data related to cafs is separately available and now included in the IEO segment. The IEO segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and full-service restaurants other than casual dining. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the global IEO segment was composed of approximately 8 million outlets and generated $1.2 trillion in annual sales in 2012 , the most recent year for which data is available. McDonalds Systemwide 2012 restaurant business accounted for 0.4% of those outlets and about 8% of the sales. Management also on occasion benchmarks McDonalds against the entire restaurant industry, including the IEO segment defined above and all other full-service restaurants. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 16 million outlets and generated $2.3 trillion in annual sales in 2012 . McDonalds Systemwide restaurant business accounted for 0.2% of those outlets and about 4% of the sales.  ##TABLE_START  Research and development ##TABLE_END The Company operates research and development facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. While research and development activities are important to the Companys business, these expenditures are not material. Independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the \"System\").  ##TABLE_START  Environmental matters ##TABLE_END Increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives, particularly in the area of climate change. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. Although the impact would likely vary by world region and/or market, we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs, including for the Company, its franchisees and suppliers. Also, there is a possibility that governmental initiatives, or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns or climate, could have a direct impact on the operations of our restaurants or the operations of our suppliers in ways which we cannot predict at this time. The Company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner. At this time, the Company has already begun to undertake its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment, including the implementation of more energy efficient equipment and management of energy use, in many of its markets.  ##TABLE_START  Number of employees ##TABLE_END The Companys number of employees worldwide, including Company-operated restaurant employees, was approximately 440,000 as of year-end 2013 . d.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  ##TABLE_END The information in this report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook. These statements use such words as may, will, expect, believe and plan. They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements. Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. The most important of these is whether we can remain relevant and a brand customers trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment. Challenging economic conditions continue to pressure our operating and financial performance. In particular, in some of our major markets, IEO segments may remain stagnant or experience modest growth, reflecting broad-based consumer caution, price sensitivity, and intensifying competitive activity by both traditional and non-traditional competitors. Further, certain menu, pricing and promotional decisions may continue to yield results below desired levels and could continue to negatively impact sales, guest counts and market share. As our business model is built around growing comparable sales to realize margin leverage, given these conditions and persistent cost pressures, we expect our results for 2014 will remain challenged. We have the added challenge of the cultural and regulatory differences that exist within and among the more than 100 countries where we operate. Initiatives we undertake may not have universal appeal among different segments of our customer base and can drive unanticipated changes in guest counts and customer perceptions. Our operations, plans and results are also affected by regulatory, tax and other initiatives around the world, notably the focus on nutritional content and the sourcing, processing and preparation of food from field to front counter, as well as industry marketing practices. These risks can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance. Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales and profits depends largely on how well we execute the Plan to Win and our global growth priorities. The Plan to Win aligns the McDonald's System around the three global growth priorities that represent our greatest opportunities to drive results - optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to our brand in order to remain relevant to our customers. It also keeps us focused on a common approach to execution through our continued emphasis on people, products, place, price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following: ##TABLE_START  Our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to trends or other factors that affect the IEO segment and our competitive position in the diverse markets we serve, such as spending patterns, demographic changes, trends in food preparation, consumer preferences and publicity about us, all of which can drive perceptions of our business or affect the willingness of other companies to enter into site, supply or other arrangements with us; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our continued innovation in all aspects of the McDonald's experience to differentiate the McDonald's experience in a way that balances value with margin levels; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of changes to our value menu, which has been and will continue to be an important component of our overall menu strategy; our ability to continue robust menu development and manage the complexity of our restaurant operations; our ability to adapt our plans to deliver a locally-relevant experience in a highly competitive, value-driven operating environment; our ability to leverage promotional or operating successes across markets; and whether sales gains associated with new product introductions are sustained; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The risks associated with our franchise business model, including whether our franchisees have the experience and financial resources to be effective operators and remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and capital-intensive initiatives, especially during periods of underperformance, and the potential impact on us if they experience food safety or other operational problems or project a brand image inconsistent with our values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subject to litigation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The success of our tiered approach to menu offerings; the impact of pricing, product, marketing and promotional plans on sales and margins; and our ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly to changing economic and competitive conditions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our ability to drive restaurant improvements that achieve optimal capacity, particularly during peak mealtime hours, and motivate our restaurant personnel and our franchisees to achieve consistency and high service levels so as to improve perceptions of our ability to meet expectations for quality food served in clean and friendly environments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our plans for restaurant reimaging and rebuilding, and whether we are able to identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants and achieve our sales and profitability targets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our ability to respond effectively to adverse perceptions about the quick-service category of the IEO segment or about our food (including its nutritional content and preparation), promotions and premiums, such as Happy Meal toys (collectively, our \"products\"), how we source the commodities we use, and our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonald's of food-borne illnesses or product safety issues; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The success of our sustainability initiatives to support our brand ambition of good food, good people and good neighbor, which will require Systemwide coordination and alignment, including with our franchisees, and whether we will be effective in addressing these and other matters of social responsibility in a way that inspires trust and confidence; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The costs and risks associated with our increasing reliance on technological and digital systems (e.g., point-of-sale and other in-store systems or platforms) tha t support our Systemwide restaurants; the risk that we will not fully realize the benefits of the significant investments we are making to enhance the customer experience; the potential for system performance failures, security breaches involving our systems or those of third-party providers; legal risks associated with data collection, protection and management, in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide technology-related services to franchisees; and litigation risk involving intellectual property rights; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of campaigns by labor organizations and activists, including through the use of social media and other mobile communications and applications, to promote adverse ##TABLE_END McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report 3 perceptions of the quick-service category of the IEO segment or our brand, management, suppliers or franchisees, or to promote or threaten boycotts, strikes or other actions involving the industry, McDonalds or our suppliers and franchisees; ##TABLE_START  The impact of events such as boycotts or protests, labor strikes and supply chain interruptions (including due to lack of supply or price increases) that can adversely affect us or the suppliers, franchisees and others that are also part of the McDonald's System and whose performance has a material impact on our results; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel to manage our operations and growth; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Whether we will be able to develop an effective and compelling global digital strategy in the future that will enhance customer engagement and whether competitor loyalty initiatives will impact our ability to attract customers, particularly as these initiatives become established and customer acquisition costs (i.e., switching costs) increase. ##TABLE_END Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, and the prolonged challenging economic environment can be expected to continue to pressure our results. Our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions, both globally and in local markets, and conditions can also vary substantially by market. The current global environment has been characterized by persistently weak economies, high unemployment rates, inflationary pressures and volatility in financial markets. Many major economies, both advanced and developing, are still facing ongoing economic issues. In the U.S., these include concerns about the long-term direction of federal fiscal policies. In many European markets, consumer and business confidence and spending remain muted. Important markets in Asia have also been experiencing slower growth rates. Uncertainty about the long-term environment could derail any potential improvements in economic activity for 2014. These conditions have pressured our performance, adversely affecting sales, guest counts and/or our market share in many markets, including some major markets. We are also facing increasing competition from an expanded set of competitors that include many non-traditional market participants such as conventional retailers and coffee shops. To address this environment, we are intensifying our focus on value as a driver of guest counts through menu, pricing and promotional actions. These actions can adversely affect our margin percent and therefore we expect that margins will remain under pressure. The key factors that can affect our operations, plans and results in this environment are the following: ##TABLE_START  Whether our strategies will be effective in enabling market share gains, which have been achieved at declining rates in recent periods, while at the same time enabling us to achieve our targeted operating income growth despite the current adverse economic conditions, resurgent competitors and an increasingly complex and costly advertising environment; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient product supply on favorable terms; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact on consumer disposable income levels and spending habits of governmental actions to manage national economic matters, whether through austerity or stimulus measures and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact on restaurant sales and margins of ongoing commodity price volatility, and the effectiveness of pricing, hedging and other actions taken to address this environment; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact on our margins of labor costs that we cannot offset through price increases, and the long-term trend toward higher wages and social expenses in both mature and developing markets, which may intensify with increasing public focus on matters of income inequality; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of foreign exchange and interest rates on our financial condition and results; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest, all of which are exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment charges that reduce our earnings; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of changes in our debt levels on our credit ratings, interest expense, availability of acceptable counterparties, ability to obtain funding on favorable terms or our operating or financial flexibility, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants. ##TABLE_END Increasing legal and regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks tha t could affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following: ##TABLE_START  The cost, compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face, including where inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect popular perceptions of our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of new, potential or changing regulations that can affect our business plans, such as those relating to product packaging, marketing and the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products, as well as the risks and costs of our labeling and other disclosure practices, particularly given varying legal requirements and practices for testing and disclosure within our industry, ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants, and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of nutritional, health and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and often have contradictory implications, but nonetheless drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that could be material to our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of litigation trends, particularly in our major markets, including class actions, labor, employment and personal injury claims, litigation with or involving our relationship with franchisees, landlord/tenant disputes and intellectual property claims (including often aggressive or ##TABLE_END4 McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems); the relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings; the cost and other effects of settlements or judgments, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products; and the scope and terms of insurance or indemnification protections that we may have; ##TABLE_START  Adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, energy and water resources, as well as the increased public focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters (e.g., packaging and waste, animal health and welfare and land use) and the increased pressure to make commitments or set targets and take actions to meet them, which could expose the Company to market, operational and execution costs or risks, particularly when actions are undertaken Systemwide; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The increasing focus on workplace practices and conditions and costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and overseas regulations affecting our workforce and labor practices, including those relating to wage and hour practices, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and unlawful workplace discrimination, and our exposure to reputational and other harm as a result of perceptions about our workplace practices or conditions or those of our franchisees; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Disruptions in our operations or price volatility in a market that can result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or import-export controls, increased tariffs or government-mandated closure of our or our suppliers' operations, and the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or proceedings, whether or not they have merit; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The legal and compliance risks and costs associated with privacy, data protection and similar laws, particularly as they apply to children, the potential costs (including the loss of consumer confidence) arising from alleged security breaches of information systems, and the risk of resulting criminal penalties or civil liability related to such breaches; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact on our operations of tax and other regulations affecting capital flows, financial markets or financial institutions, which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, changes in tax accounting or tax laws (or related authoritative interpretations), particularly if corporate tax reform becomes a key component of budgetary initiatives in the United States and elsewhere, and the impact of settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the IRS or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. ##TABLE_ENDTrading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors. Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these, some of which are outside our control, are the following: ##TABLE_START  The continuing unpredictable global economic and market conditions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the United States which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Changes in financial or tax reporting and accounting principles or practices that materially affect our reported financial condition and results and investor perceptions of our performance; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can be affected by market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete); unauthorized disclosures about our performance, plans or expectations about our business; our actual performance and creditworthiness; investor confidence generally; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonald's may be included, such as the SP 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of our stock repurchase program or dividend rate; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact on our results of other corporate actions, such as those we may take from time to time as part of our continuous review of our corporate structure in light of business, legal and tax considerations. ##TABLE_END Our results and prospects can be adversely affected by events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others. Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels or other factors that affect our results and prospects, such as commodity costs. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

Properties  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company owns and leases real estate primarily in connection with its restaurant business. The Company identifies and develops sites that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential to the Company. To assess potential, the Company analyzes traffic and walking patterns, census data and other relevant data. The Companys experience and access to advanced technology aid in evaluating this information. The Company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for restaurant sites, which ensures long-term occupancy rights and helps control related costs. Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to control average development costs through construction and design efficiencies, standardization and by leveraging the Companys global sourcing network. Additional information about the Companys properties is included in Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in Part II, Item 7, pages 10 through 25 and in Financial statements and supplementary data in Part II, Item 8, pages 25 through 42 of this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START ", "3": " ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company has pending a number of lawsuits that have been filed in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover a broad variety of allegations spanning the Companys entire business. The following is a brief description of the more significant types of lawsuits. In addition, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local regulations that impact various aspects of its business, as discussed below. While the Company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, unfavorable rulings could occur. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on net income for the period in which the ruling occurs or for future periods.  ##TABLE_START  Franchising ##TABLE_END A substantial number of McDonalds restaurants are franchised to independent owner/operators under contractual arrangements with the Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company and its franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects including, but not limited to, quality, service and cleanliness issues, contentions regarding grants or terminations of franchises, delinquent payments of rents and fees, and franchisee claims for additional franchises or rewrites of franchises. Additionally, occasional disputes arise between the Company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a McDonalds franchise. ##TABLE_START  Suppliers ##TABLE_END The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries generally do not supply food, paper or related items to any McDonalds restaurants. The Company relies upon numerous independent suppliers, including service providers, that are required to meet and maintain the Companys high standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company and its suppliers which include, by way of example, compliance with product specifications and the Companys business relationship with suppliers. In addition, disputes occasionally arise on a number of issues between the Company and individuals or entities who claim that they should be (or should have been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the Companys restaurants. ##TABLE_START  Employees ##TABLE_END Hundreds of thousands of people are employed by the Company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, thousands of people from time to time seek employment in such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes arise regarding hiring, termination, promotion and pay practices, including wage and hour disputes, alleged discrimination and compliance with employment laws.  ##TABLE_START  Customers ##TABLE_END Restaurants owned by subsidiaries of the Company regularly serve a broad segment of the public. In so doing, disputes arise as to products, service, incidents, advertising, nutritional and other disclosures, as well as other matters common to an extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company.  ##TABLE_START  Intellectual Property ##TABLE_END The Company has registered trademarks and service marks, patents and copyrights, some of which are of material importance to the Companys business. From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation to protect its intellectual property and defend against the alleged use of third party intellectual property.  ##TABLE_START  Government Regulations ##TABLE_END Local, state and federal governments have adopted laws and regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business including, but not limited to, advertising, franchising, health, safety, environment, zoning, employment and taxes.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  ##TABLE_ENDOverview DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants. Of the 35,429 restaurants in 119 countries at year-end 2013 , 28,691 were franchised (including 20,355 franchised to conventional franchisees, 4,747 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,589 licensed to foreign affiliates (\"affiliates\")primarily Japan) and 6,738 were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and dcor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market. We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to both delivering great, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. However, directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In our Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. We continually review, and as appropriate adjust, our mix of Company-operated and franchised (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and foreign affiliated) restaurants to help optimize overall performance. The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (\"U.S.\"), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (\"APMEA\"). In addition, throughout this report we present Other Countries  Corporate that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 31% , 40% and 23% of total revenues, respectively. The United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), France, Russia and Germany, collectively, account for 67% of Europes revenues; and China, Australia and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for 54% of APMEAs revenues. These seven markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise 75% of total revenues. In analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth and returns. ##TABLE_START  Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because we believe this better represents the Companys underlying business trends. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the Companys initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Generally, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. The goal is to achieve a balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. ##TABLE_END McDonalds reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have a more pronounced effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal. ##TABLE_START  Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Companys financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Return on incremental invested capital (\"ROIIC\") is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. ##TABLE_END STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the \"System\") has been key to McDonald's success. By leveraging our System, we are able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. In addition, our business model 10 McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report enables McDonald's to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve. McDonald's customer-focused Plan to Win (\"Plan\") provides a common framework that aligns our global business and allows for local adaptation. We continue to focus on our three global growth priorities of optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening accessibility to Brand McDonald's within the framework of our Plan. Our initiatives support these priorities, and are executed with a focus on the Plan's five pillars - People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion - to enhance our customers' experience and build shareholder value over the long term. We believe these priorities align with our customers' evolving needs, and - combined with our competitive advantages of convenience, menu variety, geographic diversification and System alignment - will drive long-term sustainable growth. To measure our performance as we strive to build the business, we have the following long-term, average annual constant currency financial targets: ##TABLE_START  Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating income growth of 6% to 7%; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ROIIC in the high teens. ##TABLE_END In 2013, Systemwide sales growth was 1% (3% in constant currencies), operating income growth was 2% (3% in constant currencies), one-year ROIIC was 11.4% and three-year ROIIC was 20.2% (see reconciliation on page 23). Our operating income growth and returns fell below our long-term financial targets, reflecting the impact of soft comparable sales performance. In our heavily franchised business model, growing comparable sales is important to increasing operating income and returns. In 2013, our comparable sales increased 0.2%, reflecting higher average check and negative comparable guest counts of 1.9%. Challenging conditions, including a flat or contracting informal eating out (IEO) segment in most major markets, heightened competitive activity and consumer price sensitivity, continued to pressure performance. Furthermore, McDonalds customer-facing initiatives did not generate the comparable sales lift or customer visits necessary to overcome these headwinds. In 2014, we do not expect significant changes in market dynamics given modest growth projections for the IEO segment. However, we continue to believe that our targets remain achievable over the long term. The following is a summary of our 2013 sales performance and our initiatives within the three global growth priorities by major segment. U.S. In the U.S., comparable sales declined 0.2% and comparable guest counts declined 1.6%. Guest visits were down as initiatives did not resonate as strongly as expected with customers amid a sluggish IEO segment and heightened competitive activity. The U.S. introduced a number of significant new products (such as Premium McWraps, Egg White Delight McMuffins and an extended line-up of Quarter Pounder Burgers) and featured new limited-time food and beverage options to enhance the relevance of its product offerings. Modernizing the customer experience continued through our reimaging program. During 2013, we completed about 700 restaurant reimages, of which the majority added drive-thru capacity. Currently, 45% of our restaurant interiors and exteriors reflect our contemporary restaurant design. We broadened accessibility by opening 225 new restaurants, extending hours in more restaurants, and improving the efficiency of our drive-thru service with side-by-side or tandem ordering, and hand-held order taking. More than half of our restaurants now use one of these multiple order points to maximize drive-thru capacity. In addition, the U.S. evolved its value proposition with the recent introduction of Dollar Menu  More, which is intended to offer value and variety to our customers at various price points. Europe In Europe, comparable sales were flat, while comparable guest counts declined 1.5%, as persistently low consumer confidence continued to negatively affect the IEO segment. Comparable sales results reflected positive performance in the U.K. and Russia, which were mostly offset by weak performance in Germany, where we are working on rebuilding brand relevance to address the current negative guest count trend. In 2013, we remained focused on growing the business by emphasizing value menu enhancements, premium menu additions, limited-time offers and expansion of the breakfast daypart. We also successfully launched blended ice beverages in the U.K., which positively contributed to results. In order to continue providing a relevant, contemporary customer experience, Europe completed about 470 restaurant reimages during the year. By the end of 2013, nearly 100% of restaurant interiors and 80% of exteriors were modernized. We increased our accessibility and convenience by opening 312 new restaurants, extending operating hours and optimizing our drive-thrus. We enhanced our value offerings in certain markets with multiple pricing tiers across our menu to appeal to a broad range of customers. For example, in France we launched the Casse-Crote, a two-item meal for 4.50 Euro, which positively contributed to recent results in that market. APMEA In APMEA, comparable sales declined 1.9% and comparable guest counts declined 3.8%. Our three largest markets experienced negative comparable sales, with Japan having the most significant impact. Though the challenges differ across the segment, overall performance was pressured amid slower economic growth, a highly competitive environment focused primarily on value, and issues such as Avian influenza in a few markets. In addition, softer than expected performance of new products and promotions did not overcome negative guest count trends. Throughout the segment, we focused on accelerating growth across all dayparts, with particular emphasis on dinner and the expansion of breakfast. APMEA held a National Breakfast Day, during which five thousand restaurants gave away five million Egg McMuffins to promote breakfast in the segment. We were also committed to enhancing local relevance with consumers, by balancing our global core menu with locally-relevant food and beverage choices, which included new flavor profiles designed to match local tastes. We continued to make progress in our reimaging program, completing about 240 restaurant reimages during the year. By the end of 2013, over 65% of restaurant interiors and over 55% of exteriors were modernized. We opened 731 new restaurants, including 275 in China. We deployed our convenience initiatives to more restaurants, including dessert kiosks, delivery service, drive-thrus and extended hours. In addition, we continued to evolve our everyday value platform by including more affordable menu options and promotional offers across dayparts and price points.  McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report 11 Consolidated Operating Results Globally, our approach to offering variety and value across the menu to our customers is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies, and leveraging our scale and supply chain infrastructure to manage costs. In 2013, we maintained a full-year combined operating margin of 31.2%, as we grew revenues 2% and managed our expenses. We continued our long-standing commitment to fiscal discipline and maintained a strong financial foundation. Cash from operations benefits from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income we receive from franchisees provides a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs. In addition, the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the Company-owned model. We believe locally-owned and operated restaurants are important to McDonald's being not just a global brand, but also a locally-relevant one. In 2013, cash from operations was $7.1 billion.  Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provided us flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures of approximately $2.8 billion were invested in our business, of which more than half was devoted to new restaurant openings and the remainder was reinvested in our existing restaurants. Across the System, 1,438 restaurants were opened and over 1,500 existing locations were reimaged. We continued to return all free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) to shareholders, and in 2013 returned $4.9 billion to shareholders consisting of $3.1 billion in dividends and $1.8 billion in share repurchases. RESULTS FROM THE YEAR: ##TABLE_START  Global comparable sales increased 0.2% and comparable guest counts declined 1.9%. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consolidated revenues increased 2% (2% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consolidated operating income increased 2% (3% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted earnings per share was $5.55, an increase of 4% (4% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash provided by operations was $7.1 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  One-year ROIIC was 11.4%  and three-year ROIIC was 20.2%  for the period ended December 31, 2013. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 5% to $0.81 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $3.24 per share. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company returned $4.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. ##TABLE_END OUTLOOK FOR 2014  We are focused on delivering great-tasting, high-quality, affordable food and beverages and an exceptional experience for our customers. By leveraging our competitive advantages, we are well-positioned to pursue the long-term opportunities that exist in the over $1 trillion IEO segment. We do not expect significant changes in market dynamics in 2014 given modest growth projections for the IEO segment. We will remain focused on matters within our control, with the customer as our first priority. We plan to strengthen our relationship with the customer through better restaurant execution and by further leveraging consumer insights in our efforts to optimize current initiatives for greater relevance and broader consumer reach. We remain committed to adapting to keep pace with evolving customer needs and investing today to meet future demand. In addition, we are prioritizing our near-term efforts on improving performance in key opportunity markets that are significant contributors to consolidated results. These include Germany, Japan and the U.S., which have experienced weak or negative performance. We will continue to execute against our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience and broaden accessibility to Brand McDonalds. Our focus will be on our core classics, as well as menu items in the beef, chicken, breakfast and beverages categories, where we believe there is the most growth opportunity relative to other categories in the industry. In addition, we plan to introduce new ingredients and greater choice to broaden the appeal of our menu. We will enhance the customer experience by continuing to reimage our building interiors and exteriors, expand our service offerings and develop our digital strategies. At the same time, we remain committed to Quality, Service and Cleanliness, which is foundational to everything we do in the restaurants. To broaden our accessibility, we plan to expand through geographically diversified new restaurant development, extend hours in more restaurants, improve the efficiency of our drive-thrus and provide more delivery service and dessert kiosks. In addition, we will continue to evolve our value platform, offering more choices at every price tier. Furthermore, McDonalds is committed to growing our business sustainably and making a positive difference in society. Our key areas of focus include improving customer perceptions of our food, sustainable sourcing, providing job opportunities and training for our people, developing environmentally efficient restaurants and having a positive impact in the communities we serve. U.S. In 2014, the U.S. will make adjustments designed to regain momentum, including providing greater customer relevance and better restaurant execution. Our 2014 menu strategies better balance affordability, core products, new choices and limited-time offers. We will also adjust the pace of product introductions to improve restaurant operations and marketing execution in order to provide a better customer experience. These initiatives are complemented by a consistent focus on core equities, such as breakfast. We will enhance the breakfast experience by emphasizing coffee through high-quality McCaf products paired with delicious foods - both existing and new. Bold new flavor extensions will be introduced to build upon our core and lay the groundwork for future innovations. We plan to open about 250 new restaurants and to continue our reimaging program by updating  approximately 300 existing restaurants in 2014, a slightly slower pace as we prioritize other kitchen investments. Europe In Europe, we plan to optimize the menu through value menu enhancements, premium menu additions and limited-time offers, and will continue to expand the breakfast daypart by leveraging our strong foundation in coffee. In addition, following the U.K.s successful rollout of McCaf smoothies and frapps, we anticipate about 4,500 restaurants in Europe will have the blended-ice platform by the end of 2014. To modernize the way we interact with our customers, we plan to leverage the use of technology, such as self-order kiosks and mobile and web ordering. We will focus on broadening accessibility by continuing to extend operating hours, optimizing drive-thrus, and expanding everyday value platforms. We plan to open over 300  new restaurants and reimage approximately 400 existing restaurants in 2014. 12 McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report APMEA In 2014, APMEAs growth opportunities include menu variety, convenience, value evolution and restaurant expansion. We will balance core and limited-time offers and execute a series of exciting food events. APMEA will shift existing value platforms toward more compelling offers that resonate with customers and generate incremental visits, including mid-tier options to fill the gap between entry-level options and Extra Value Meals. Our efforts around reimaging will continue as we expect to modernize approximately 400 existing restaurants. Our plan is to open around 800 new restaurants, with about 300 expected in China. In addition, we will evolve our franchising strategy to include more conventional franchisees and developmental licensees, enabling an increased pace of development and enhanced profitability. Consolidated In making capital allocation decisions, our goal is to make investments that elevate the McDonald's experience and drive sustainable long-term growth in sales and market share. We focus on markets that generate strong returns or have opportunities for long-term growth. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) to shareholders over the long-term via dividends and share repurchases. McDonald's does not provide specific guidance on diluted earnings per share. The following information is provided to assist in forecasting the Company's future results: ##TABLE_START  Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 2.5 percentage points to 2014 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 949 net restaurants (1,098 net traditional openings less 149 net satellite closings) added in 2013. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 4 cents. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  With about 75% of McDonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company's commodity costs. For the full year 2014, the total basket of goods cost is expected to increase 1.0-2.0% in the U.S. and Europe. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects full-year 2014 selling, general and administrative expenses to increase approximately 8% in constant currencies, with fluctuations expected between the quarters. The increase is primarily due to the impact of below target 2013 incentive-based compensation, expenses associated with our Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention and sponsorship of the Winter Olympic games, and costs related to other initiatives. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2014 to increase approximately 5-7% compared with 2013. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  A significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 65% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 25 cents. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2014 to be 31% to 33%. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects capital expenditures for 2014 to be between $2.9 - $3.0 billion. Over half of this amount will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open about 1,500 - 1,600 restaurants including about 500 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets, such as Japan and Latin America, where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of between 1,000 - 1,100 restaurants. The remaining capital will be used to reinvest in existing locations, in part through reimaging. Over 1,000 restaurants worldwide are expected to be reimaged, including locations in affiliated and developmental licensee markets that require no capital investment from the Company. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects to return approximately $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2014. ##TABLE_END McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report 13 Consolidated Operating Results ##TABLE_START Operating results           Dollars and shares in millions, except per share data  Amount  Increase/ (decrease)   Amount  Increase/ (decrease)   Amount Revenues             Sales by Company-operated restaurants  $ 18,875  %   $ 18,603  %   $ 18,293 Revenues from franchised restaurants  9,231    8,964    8,713 Total revenues  28,106    27,567    27,006 Operating costs and expenses             Company-operated restaurant expenses  15,579    15,224    14,838 Franchised restaurants-occupancy expenses  1,624    1,527    1,481 Selling, general  administrative expenses  2,386  (3 )   2,455    2,394 Other operating (income) expense, net  (247 )  (2 )   (244 )  (3 )   (237 ) Total operating costs and expenses  19,342   18,962    18,476 Operating income  8,764    8,605    8,530 Interest expense        Nonoperating (income) expense, net   n/m    (64 )   Income before provision for income taxes  8,204    8,079    8,012 Provision for income taxes  2,618    2,614    2,509 Net income  $ 5,586  %   $ 5,465  (1 %)   $ 5,503 Earnings per common sharediluted  $ 5.55  %   $ 5.36  %   $ 5.27 Weighted-average common shares outstanding diluted  1,006.0  (1 %)   1,020.2  (2 %)   1,044.9 ##TABLE_ENDn/m Not meaningful IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonalds mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing goods and services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows. In 2013, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results due to the weaker Australian Dollar, Japanese Yen and many other foreign currencies, partly offset by the stronger Euro. In 2012, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results primarily due to the weaker Euro, along with most other currencies. In 2011, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by the stronger Euro and Australian Dollar, as well as most other currencies.

Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.05 on diluted earnings per share. Net income and diluted earnings per share growth in constant currencies were positively impacted by higher franchised margin dollars, and to a lesser extent, lower selling, general and administrative expenses. This was partly offset by lower Company-operated margin dollars. A decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding also contributed to the diluted earnings per share growth in 2013. In 2012, net income decreased 1% (increased 3% in constant currencies) to $5.5 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 2% (5% in constant currencies) to $5.36. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.17 on diluted earnings per share. Net income and diluted earnings per share growth in constant currencies were positively impacted by growth in franchised margin dollars, partly offset by a higher effective income tax rate and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. A decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding also contributed to the diluted earnings per share growth in 2012. The Company repurchased 18.7 million shares of its stock for $1.8 billion in 2013 and 28.1 million shares of its stock for $2.6 billion in 2012 , driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods. ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_ENDREVENUES The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. In 2013 , constant currency revenue growth was due to expansion. Weak comparable sales reflected a muted response to customer-facing initiatives amid a highly competitive and sluggish IEO segment across many markets. In 2012 , constant currency revenue growth was driven primarily by positive comparable sales as well as expansion. ##TABLE_START Revenues   Amount   Increase/(decrease)   Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation  Dollars in millions        Company-operated sales:               U.S.  $ 4,512  $ 4,530  $ 4,433  %  %  %  % Europe  8,138  7,850  7,852     APMEA  5,425  5,350  5,061     Other Countries  Corporate     (8 )  (8 )  (6 )  (7 ) Total  $ 18,875  $ 18,603  $ 18,293  %  %  %  % Franchised revenues:               U.S.  $ 4,339  $ 4,284  $ 4,096  %  %  %  % Europe  3,162  2,977  3,034   (2 )   APMEA  1,052  1,041      Other Countries  Corporate        Total  $ 9,231  $ 8,964  $ 8,713  %  %  %  % Total revenues:               U.S.  $ 8,851  $ 8,814  $ 8,529  %  %  %  % Europe  11,300  10,827  10,886   (1 )   APMEA  6,477  6,391  6,019     Other Countries  Corporate  1,478  1,535  1,572  (4 )  (2 )   Total  $ 28,106  $ 27,567  $ 27,006  %  %  %  %                ##TABLE_ENDIn the U.S., revenues were relatively flat in 2013 as the positive impact of expansion was offset by negative comparable sales, reflecting initiatives that did not resonate as strongly as expected with customers. Revenues increased in 2012 primarily due to positive comparable sales, reflecting everyday value offerings, menu variety and the enhanced customer experience due to reimaging, despite broad competitive activity. Europe's constant currency increase in revenues in 2013 benefited from expansion, primarily in Russia (which is almost entirely Company-operated), and positive comparable sales performance in the U.K. and Russia, the segment's two largest Company-operated restaurant markets, partly offset by negative results in Germany. The 2012 increase was primarily driven by positive comparable sales in the U.K. and Russia, as well as expansion in Russia. In APMEA, the constant currency increase in revenues in 2013 was driven by expansion in China and other markets, partly offset by negative comparable sales, primarily in China (which is mostly Company-operated). The constant currency increase in revenues in 2012 was primarily driven by positive comparable sales in China, Australia and many other markets, as well as expansion, primarily in China.

In Europe, the franchised margin percent decreased in 2013 due to higher rent expense in many markets and weak 16 McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report comparable sales primarily due to Germany. The decrease in 2012 reflected positive comparable sales and higher occupancy costs. In APMEA, the franchised margin percent decreased in 2013 partly due to Japan's negative sales performance and the impact of the weaker Yen, which reduced its contribution to the segment's margin percent. In addition, the segment was negatively impacted by a decline in Australia's results. The decrease in 2012 was primarily due to Australia. The franchised margin percent in APMEA and Other Countries  Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. ##TABLE_START  Company-operated margins ##TABLE_END Company-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants.  Company-operated margin dollars decreased $83 million or 2% (2% in constant currencies) in 2013, and decreased $76 million or 2% (increased 1% in constant currencies) in 2012. In 2013, Company-operated margin dollars reflected weak comparable sales in many markets, which impacted our ability to overcome cost pressures. On a constant currency basis, the decrease in Company-operated margin dollars was primarily due to APMEA and the U.S., partly offset by positive performance in Europe. In 2012, Company-operated margin dollars were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of $97 million, primarily in Europe. On a constant currency basis, the increase in Company-operated margin dollars was due to positive performance in Europe, offset by lower results in APMEA and the U.S. as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher costs.

Europes Company-operated margin percent increased in 2013 due to the positive impact of sales performance in Russia, the U.K. and France, mostly offset by higher commodity and occupancy costs. The margin percent decreased in 2012 primarily due to higher labor and commodity costs across several markets, despite positive comparable sales in Russia and the U.K. In APMEA, the Company-operated margin percent in 2013 decreased primarily due to higher labor, occupancy and other costs, and negative comparable guest counts, partly offset by a higher average check. The margin percent decreased in 2012 primarily due to higher labor and occupancy costs, partly offset by positive comparable sales. New restaurant openings, mainly in China, negatively impacted the margin percent in both periods. Similar to other markets, new restaurants in China initially open with lower margins that grow over time. ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_ENDSELLING, GENERAL  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses decreased  3% ( 3% in constant currencies) in 2013 and increased 3% (4% in constant currencies) in 2012. The 2013 decrease was due to lower incentive-based compensation, partly offset by higher employee costs. The comparison to costs related to the 2012 London Olympics sponsorship and the 2012 Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention also contributed to the decrease in 2013, as well as the increase in 2012.

Resulting gains or losses on sales of restaurant businesses are recorded in operating income because these transactions are a recurring part of our business. Gains on sales of restaurant businesses increased in 2013 due primarily to more stores sold in Australia. The increase in 2012 was due primarily to sales of restaurants in China to developmental licensees, as well as sales of restaurants in Europe and Canada. ##TABLE_START  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates ##TABLE_END Unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates, but does not control.

McDonalds share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. is reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased in 2013 and 2012 due to lower operating results, primarily in Japan. ##TABLE_START  Asset dispositions and other expense ##TABLE_END Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for restaurant closings and uncollectible receivables, asset write-offs due to restaurant reinvestment, and other miscellaneous income and expenses. Asset dispositions and other expense decreased in 2013 due to the favorable resolution of certain liabilities and lower asset retirements, partly offset by lower gains on property sales and unconsolidated partnership dissolutions.

In Europe, results for 2013 and 2012 were driven by higher franchised and Company-operated margin dollars. Results in 2012 also benefited from higher gains on sales of restaurants, partly offset by incremental selling, general and administrative expenses related to the 2012 London Olympics. In APMEA, results for 2013 reflected higher franchised margin dollars, mostly offset by lower Company-operated margin dollars.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES In 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , the reported effective income tax rates were 31.9% , 32.4% and 31.3%, respectively. In 2013, the effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of nearly $50 million, reflecting the retroactive impact of certain tax benefits as a result of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. In 2012, the effective income tax rate reflected the negative impact of certain tax benefits in the U.S. that had expired at December 31, 2011 and were reinstated retroactively in 2013 as noted above. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.5 billion in 2013 and 2012 . Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets. ##TABLE_START Cash Flows  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $7.1 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.3 billion in 2013, while cash provided by operations totaled $7.0 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $3.9 billion in 2012. In 2013, cash provided by operations increased $155 million or 2% compared with 2012 primarily due to increased operating results. In 2012, cash provided by operations decreased $184 million or 3% compared with 2011 despite increased operating results, primarily due to higher income tax payments and the negative impact of foreign currency translation on operating results. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.7 billion in 2013, a decrease of $493 million compared with 2012. The decrease primarily reflected lower capital expenditures and a decrease in other investing activities related to short-term time deposits. Cash used for investing activities totaled $3.2 billion in 2012, an increase of $596 million compared with 2011. The increase primarily reflected higher capital expenditures, an increase in other investing activities related to short-term time deposits, and lower proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.0 billion in 2013, an increase of $193 million compared with 2012, primarily due to lower net debt issuances and higher dividend payments, partly offset by lower treasury stock purchases. Cash used for financing activities totaled $3.8 billion in 2012, a decrease of $683 million compared with 2011, primarily due to lower treasury stock purchases and higher net debt issuances, partly offset by higher dividend payments. The Companys cash and equivalents balance was $2.8 billion and $2.3 billion at year end 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company made a debt repayment of $535 million in January 2014. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In 2013, the Company opened 1,393 traditional restaurants and 45 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 295 traditional restaurants and 194 satellite restaurants. In 2012, the Company opened 1,404 traditional restaurants and 35 satellite restaurants and closed 269 traditional restaurants and 200 satellite restaurants. The majority of restaurant openings and closings occurred in the major markets in both years. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.

Over 80% of the restaurants at year-end 2013 were franchised.  McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report 19 Capital expenditures decreased $224 million or 7% in 2013, primarily due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants, partly offset by higher investment in new restaurants. Capital expenditures increased $319 million or 12% in 2012, primarily due to higher reinvestment in existing restaurants and higher investment in new restaurants. In 2013, the lower reinvestment primarily reflected fewer planned reimages. In both years, the increase related to new restaurants reflected our commitment to broaden accessibility to our brand. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented over 70% of the total in 2013, 2012 and 2011.

Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $3.0 million in 2013. The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2013 and 2012. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS For the last three years, the Company returned a total of $16.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Shares repurchased and dividends  ##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data   Number of shares repurchased 18.7  28.1  41.9 Shares outstanding at year end  1,003  1,021 Dividends declared per share $ 3.12  $ 2.87  $ 2.53       Treasury stock purchases (in Shareholders' equity) $ 1,810  $ 2,605  $ 3,373 Dividends paid 3,115  2,897  2,610 Total returned to shareholders $ 4,925  $ 5,502  $ 5,983 ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, effective August 1, 2012, that authorizes the purchase of up to $10 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. In 2013, approximately 18.7 million shares were repurchased for $1.8 billion , bringing the total purchases under the program to $2.6 billion. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 38 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2013 full year dividend of $ 3.12 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.77 per share, with an increase to $0.81 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 5% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $3.24 per share annual dividend and reflects the Companys confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors. ##TABLE_START Financial Position and Capital Resources  ##TABLE_ENDTOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS Total assets increased $1.2 billion or 4% in 2013. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $1.5 billion in 2013. Approximately 80% of total assets were in major markets at year-end 2013. Net property and equipment increased $1.1 billion in 2013, primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation, and represented about 70% of total assets at year end. Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Returns on assets and equity ##TABLE_START    Return on average assets 24.8 %  25.4 %  26.0 % Return on average common equity 35.8  37.5  37.7 ##TABLE_ENDIn 2013, return on average assets and return on average common equity decreased, reflecting lower growth in operating results. In 2012, return on average assets and return on average common equity decreased due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation primarily on operating income and net income. Operating income does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about two percentage points for all years presented. 20 McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report FINANCING AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2013 totaled $14.1 billion, compared with $13.6 billion at December 31, 2012. The net increase in 2013 was primarily due to net issuances of $535 million.

Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Under existing authorization from the Companys Board of Directors, at December 31, 2013, the Company had $3.6 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $1.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2014 is approximately $530 million of long-term corporate debt. In 2014, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. As of December 31, 2013, the Company's subsidiaries also had $610 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $5.8 billion and $4.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Companys restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2013, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position. The Companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures ##TABLE_START In millions of U.S. Dollars  Euro $ 7,302  $ 6,692 Australian Dollars 1,933  2,450 British Pounds Sterling 1,479  1,117 Canadian Dollars 1,412  1,319 Russian Ruble  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2013 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2013 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. LIQUIDITY The Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where we earn over 60% of our operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made,  McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report 21 and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. Accordingly, no U.S. federal or state income taxes have been provided on these undistributed foreign earnings. The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2013 . We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds. Consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities. In the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future. While the likelihood is remote, to the extent foreign cash is available, the Company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits), which could result in a use of cash. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. Refer to the Income Taxes note to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Companys borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2013 . See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details. ##TABLE_START  Contractual cash outflows   Contractual cash inflows  In millions Operating leases   Debt obligations (1)   Minimum rent under franchise arrangements   $ 1,440      $ 2,703  1,334   $ 1,199   2,612  1,218   2,095   2,507  1,099   1,054   2,377    1,004   2,260 Thereafter  7,632   8,765   18,042 Total  $ 13,713   $ 14,117   $ 30,501 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The maturities reflect reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $1.2 billion , as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in November 2016. Debt obligations do not include $13 million of noncash fair value hedging adjustments or $222 million of accrued interest. ##TABLE_ENDIn the U.S., the Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") limitations. At December 31, 2013, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $531 million . In addition, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $513 million at December 31, 2013. There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. The amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the Companys financial position. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows. ##TABLE_START Other Matters  ##TABLE_ENDCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: ##TABLE_START  Property and equipment ##TABLE_END Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. ##TABLE_START  Share-based compensation ##TABLE_END The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Companys stock over the expected 22 McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. ##TABLE_START  Long-lived assets impairment review ##TABLE_END Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Companys experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Companys estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual country) with goodwill currently at risk of impairment. ##TABLE_START  Litigation accruals ##TABLE_END In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. ##TABLE_START  Income taxes ##TABLE_END The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. In 2012, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") completed its examination of the Company's U.S. federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. The Company and the IRS reached an agreement on adjustments that had been previously proposed by the IRS. The agreement did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows, results of operations or financial position. The Company's 2009 and 2010 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the field examination is expected in 2014. In connection with this examination, the Company received notices of proposed adjustments (\"NOPAs\") in 2014 and expects to receive additional NOPAs within the next 12 months from the IRS related to certain transfer pricing matters. It is reasonably possible that the receipt of these future NOPAs will provide new information that causes the Company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded. While the Company cannot estimate the impact that new information may have on our unrecognized tax benefit balance, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined under Topic 740 - Income Taxes of the Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $16.1 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management's intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICESINFLATION The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. RECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL ROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of our markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Companys incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period. The denominator is the weighted-average cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. The weighted-average cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarters investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2013 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2013 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2012 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full-year impact on 2013 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2012 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows:  McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report 23 One-year ROIIC calculation (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Incremental change  NUMERATOR:       Operating income $ 8,764.3  $ 8,604.6   $ 159.7 Depreciation and amortization 1,585.1  1,488.5   96.6 Currency translation (1)      81.8 Incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 338.1 DENOMINATOR:       Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (2)      $ 2,951.7 Currency translation (1)      1.2 Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 2,952.9 One-year ROIIC      11.4 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Represents one-year weighted-average cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the cash used for investing activities for each quarter in the two-year period ended December 31, 2013 . ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,     Cash used for investing activities  $ 2,673.8  $ 3,167.3 AS A PERCENT     Quarters ended:     March 31  87.5 %  12.5 % June 30  62.5  37.5 September 30  37.5  62.5 December 31  12.5  87.5 ##TABLE_ENDThree-year ROIIC calculation (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Incremental change  NUMERATOR:       Operating income $ 8,764.3  $ 7,473.1   $ 1,291.2 Depreciation and amortization 1,585.1  1,276.2   308.9 Currency translation (3)      25.1 Incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 1,625.2 DENOMINATOR:       Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (4)      $ 8,089.6 Currency translation (3)      (27.5 ) Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 8,062.1 Three-year ROIIC      20.2 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Represents three-year weighted-average cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the cash used for investing activities for each quarter in the four-year period ended December 31, 2013 . ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,   2012 2010 Cash used for investing activities $ 2,673.8 $ 3,167.3 $ 2,570.9 $ 2,056.0 AS A PERCENT     Quarters ended:     March 31 87.5 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 12.5 % June 30 62.5 100.0 100.0 37.5 September 30 37.5 100.0 100.0 62.5 December 31 12.5 100.0 100.0 87.5 ##TABLE_END24 McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report RISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook for 2014 .

All restaurants are operated either by the Company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchise arrangements, and foreign affiliates and developmental licensees under license agreements. The following table presents restaurant information by ownership type: ##TABLE_START Restaurants at December 31,   Conventional franchised 20,355  19,869  19,527 Developmental licensed 4,747  4,350  3,929 Foreign affiliated 3,589  3,663  3,619 Franchised 28,691  27,882  27,075 Company-operated 6,738  6,598  6,435 Systemwide restaurants 35,429  34,480  33,510 ##TABLE_ENDThe results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees were not material either individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale. CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily McDonalds Japan) are accounted for by the equity method. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers, and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the variable interest entity consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented. ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and foreign affiliates. Sales by Company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis. The Company presents sales net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and may include initial fees. Continuing rent and royalties are recognized in the period earned. Initial fees are recognized upon opening of a restaurant or granting of a new franchise term, which is when the Company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise arrangement. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Generally, the functional currency of operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency. ADVERTISING COSTS Advertising costs included in operating expenses of Company-operated restaurants primarily consist of contributions to advertising cooperatives and were (in millions): 2013  $808.4 ; 2012  $787.5 ; 2011  $768.6 . Production costs for radio and television advertising are expensed when the commercials are initially aired. These production costs, primarily in the U.S., as well as other marketing-related expenses included in Selling, general  administrative expenses were (in millions): 2013  $75.4 ; 2012  $113.5 ; 2011  $74.4 . Costs related to the Olympics sponsorship are included in these expenses for 2012. In addition, significant advertising costs are incurred by franchisees through contributions to advertising cooperatives in individual markets. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Share-based compensation includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value. Share-based compensation expense and the effect on diluted earnings per common share were as follows: ##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data   Share-based compensation expense $ 89.1  $ 93.4  $ 86.2 After tax $ 60.6  $ 63.2  $ 59.2 Earnings per common share-diluted $ 0.06  $ 0.06  $ 0.05 ##TABLE_ENDCompensation expense related to share-based awards is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in Selling, general  administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2013 , there was $109.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for the 2013 , 2012 and 2011 stock option grants. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical trends. Expected stock price volatility is generally based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock for a period approximating the expected life. The expected dividend yield is based on the Companys most recent annual dividend rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life.  Weighted-average assumptions ##TABLE_START  2012 Expected dividend yield 3.5 % 2.8 % 3.2 % Expected stock price volatility 20.6 % 20.8 % 21.5 % Risk-free interest rate 1.2 % 1.1 % 2.8 % Expected life of options (in years) 6.1 6.1 6.3 Fair value per option granted $ 11.09 $ 13.65 $ 12.18 ##TABLE_ENDPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildingsup to 40 years; leasehold improvements the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms , which generally include option periods; and equipment three to 12 years.  McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report 31 GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurant businesses. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of McDonald's restaurants from franchisees and ownership increases in subsidiaries or affiliates, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit (defined as each individual country). The Company conducts goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever an indicator of impairment exists. If an indicator of impairment exists (e.g., estimated earnings multiple value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value), the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit, generally based on discounted future cash flows, with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the carrying amount of goodwill. Historically, goodwill impairment has not significantly impacted the consolidated financial statements. The following table presents the 2013 activity in goodwill by segment: ##TABLE_START In millions U.S.  Europe APMEA (1)  Other Countries  Corporate (2)  Consolidated  Balance at December 31, 2012 $ 1,294.2  $ 881.4  $ 438.7  $ 189.7  $ 2,804.0 Net restaurant purchases (sales) (0.6 )  50.4  30.7  15.7  96.2 Currency translation   26.3  (40.7 )  (13.1 )  (27.5 ) Balance at December 31, 2013 $ 1,293.6  $ 958.1  $ 428.7  $ 192.3  $ 2,872.7 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) APMEA represents Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Other Countries  Corporate represents Canada, Latin America and Corporate. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDLONG-LIVED ASSETS Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing McDonalds restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together at a television market level in the U.S. and at a country level for each of the international markets. The Company manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurants cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment (e.g., negative operating cash flows for the most recent trailing 24 -month period) exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows. Losses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal, the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses relate to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered available for sale. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, and certain non-financial assets and liabilities on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value disclosures are reflected in a three-level hierarchy, maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: ##TABLE_START  Level 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for an identical asset or liability in an active market. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for a similar asset or liability in an active market or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END Certain of the Companys derivatives are valued using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate observable market parameters, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates, classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. Derivative valuations incorporate credit risk adjustments that are necessary to reflect the probability of default by the counterparty or the Company.  32 McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report ##TABLE_START  Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value ##TABLE_END The following tables present financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the valuation hierarchy as defined in the fair value guidance:  ##TABLE_START December 31, 2013       In millions Level 1*  Level 2  Carrying Value  Investments $ 27.6     $ 27.6 Derivative assets 128.2  $ 71.6   199.8 Total assets at fair value $ 155.8  $ 71.6   $ 227.4 Derivative liabilities   $ (179.3 )   $ (179.3 ) Total liabilities at fair value   $ (179.3 )   $ (179.3 )         December 31, 2012       In millions Level 1*  Level 2  Carrying Value  Investments $ 155.1     $ 155.1 Derivative assets 132.3  $ 86.1   218.4 Total assets at fair value $ 287.4  $ 86.1   $ 373.5 Derivative liabilities   $ (42.6 )   $ (42.6 ) Total liabilities at fair value   $ (42.6 )   $ (42.6 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Level 1 is comprised of investments and derivatives that hedge market driven changes in liabilities associated with the Companys supplemental benefit plans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis ##TABLE_END Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). For the year ended December 31, 2013 , no material fair value adjustments or fair value measurements were required for non-financial assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_START  Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2013 , the fair value of the Companys debt obligations was estimated at $15.0 billion , compared to a carrying amount of $14.1 billion . The fair value was based on quoted market prices, Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. The carrying amount for both cash equivalents and notes receivable approximate fair value. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt and derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of these changes. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. The Company documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions, as well as all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items. The Companys derivatives that are designated for hedge accounting consist mainly of interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, foreign currency options, and cross-currency swaps, further explained in the \"Fair Value,\" \"Cash Flow\" and \"Net Investment\" hedge sections. The Company also enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded primarily in Selling, general  administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Since these derivatives are not designated for hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in Nonoperating (income) expense together with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. A portion of the Companys foreign currency options (more fully described in the \"Cash Flow Hedges\" section) are undesignated as hedging instruments as the underlying foreign currency royalties are earned. All derivative instruments designated for hedge accounting are classified as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. All derivatives (including those not designated for hedge accounting) are recognized on the Consolidated balance sheet at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity dates. Changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments are reflected as adjustments to other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") and/or current earnings.

The Company's fair value hedges convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt by use of interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2013 , $2.2 billion of the Company's outstanding fixed-rate debt was effectively converted. All of the Companys interest rate swaps meet the shortcut method requirements. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying debt. No ineffectiveness has been recorded to net income related to interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the year ended December 31, 2013. ##TABLE_START  Cash Flow Hedges ##TABLE_END The Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. The types of cash flow hedges the Company enters into include interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, foreign currency options and cross currency swaps. The Company periodically uses interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of floating-rate debt, including forecasted debt issuances, into fixed-rate debt. The agreements are intended to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies), the Company uses foreign currency forwards and foreign currency options to hedge a portion of anticipated exposures. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the decline in value of future foreign denominated royalties is offset by gains in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards and/or foreign currency options. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in the value of future foreign denominated royalties is offset by losses in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards and/or foreign currency options. Although the fair value changes in the foreign currency options may fluctuate over the period of the contract, the Companys total loss on a foreign currency option is limited to the upfront premium paid for the contract; however, the potential gains on a foreign currency option are unlimited. In some situations, the Company uses foreign currency collars, which limit the potential gains and lower the upfront premium paid, to protect against currency movements. The hedges cover the next 19 months for certain exposures and are denominated in various currencies. As of December 31, 2013 , the Company had derivatives outstanding with an equivalent notional amount of $730.3 million that were used to hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency denominated royalties. The Company excludes the time value of foreign currency options from its effectiveness assessment on its cash flow hedges. As a result, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to this component, as well as the ineffectiveness of the hedges, are recognized in earnings currently. The effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is reported in the cash flow hedging component of OCI in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the risk of cash flows associated with certain foreign currency denominated debt, including forecasted interest payments, and has elected cash flow hedge accounting. The hedges cover periods up to 47 months and have an equivalent notional amount of $346.9 million . The Company manages its exposure to energy-related transactions in certain markets by entering into purchase and sale agreements. Previously, some of these agreements were considered commodity forwards and the Company elected cash flow hedge accounting, the impact of which was immaterial. In 2013, the Company determined these transactions were now eligible for the normal purchase/normal sale scope exception, which meant no further derivative or hedge accounting was required. The Company recorded after tax adjustments to the cash flow hedging component of accumulated OCI in shareholders equity. The Company recorded a net decrease of $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and a net increase of $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . Based on interest rates and foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2013 , the $2.3 million in cumulative cash flow hedging losses , after tax, at December 31, 2013 , is not expected to have a significant effect on earnings over the next 12 months. ##TABLE_START  Net Investment Hedges ##TABLE_END The Company primarily uses foreign currency denominated debt (third party and intercompany) to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders equity in the foreign currency translation component of OCI and offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in OCI. As of December 31, 2013 , $4.7 billion of the Companys third party foreign currency denominated debt, $4.2 billion of intercompany foreign currency denominated debt, and $827.4 million of derivatives were designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. ##TABLE_START  Credit Risk ##TABLE_END The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its hedging instruments. The counterparties to these agreements consist of a diverse group of financial institutions and market participants. The Company continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and adjusts positions as appropriate. The Company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2013 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. For financial reporting purposes, the Company presents gross derivative balances in the financial statements and supplementary data, even for counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2013 , neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where its counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions. INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES The Company, like other multi-national companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. Accordingly, tax liabilities are recorded when, in managements judgment, a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may still be recorded depending on managements assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled. The Company records interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.  McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report 35 PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION Diluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of shares): 2013  7.6 ; 2012  10.1 ; 2011  12.8 . Stock options that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutive were (in millions of shares): 2013  4.7 ; 2012  4.7 ; 2011  0.0 . The Company has elected to exclude the pro forma deferred tax asset associated with share-based compensation in earnings per share. STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS The Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").

The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonalds share of results. For foreign affiliated marketsprimarily Japanresults are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonalds share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. are reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. ##TABLE_START  Asset dispositions and other expense ##TABLE_END Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for restaurant closings and uncollectible receivables, asset write-offs due to restaurant reinvestment, and other miscellaneous income and expenses. ##TABLE_START Contingencies  ##TABLE_ENDIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 36 McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report ##TABLE_START Franchise Arrangements  ##TABLE_ENDConventional franchise arrangements generally include a lease and a license and provide for payment of initial fees, as well as continuing rent and royalties to the Company based upon a percent of sales with minimum rent payments that parallel the Companys underlying leases and escalations (on properties that are leased). Under this arrangement, franchisees are granted the right to operate a restaurant using the McDonalds System and, in most cases, the use of a restaurant facility, generally for a period of 20 years . These franchisees pay related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. Affiliates and developmental licensees operating under license agreements pay a royalty to the Company based upon a percent of sales, and may pay initial fees.

Lease terms for most restaurants, where market conditions allow, are generally for 20 years and, in many cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options, with certain leases providing purchase options. Escalation terms vary by geographic segment with examples including fixed-rent escalations, escalations based on an inflation index, and fair-value market adjustments. The timing of these escalations generally ranges from annually to every five years. For most locations, the Company is obligated for the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance; however, for franchised sites, the Company requires the franchisees to pay these costs. In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-cancelable leases covering certain offices and vehicles.

After considering the deferred tax accounting impact, it is expected that about $380 million of the total as of December 31, 2013 would favorably affect the effective tax rate if resolved in the Companys favor. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START In millions  Balance at January 1 $ 482.4  $ 565.0 Decreases for positions taken in prior years (38.3 )  (65.7 ) Increases for positions taken in prior years 29.4  36.9 Increases for positions related to the current year 53.8  47.3 Settlements with taxing authorities (2.4 )  (95.8 ) Lapsing of statutes of limitations (12.2 )  (5.3 ) Balance at December 31 (1) $ 512.7  $ 482.4 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Of this amount, $495.1 million and $481.7 million are included in long-term liabilities for 2013 and 2012 , respectively, and $16.8 million is included in current liabilities - income taxes for 2013 on the Consolidated balance sheet. The remainder is included in deferred income taxes on the Consolidated balance sheet. ##TABLE_END In December 2012, the Company reached a final settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") Appeals Division regarding its U.S. federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. The Company agreed to a settlement of about $80 million , primarily related to proposed foreign tax credit adjustments of about $400 million . The liabilities previously recorded and determined in accordance with Topic 740 - Income Taxes of the Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") related to this matter were adequate. Additionally, no cash payment was made related to this settlement as the Company had previously made a tax deposit with the IRS. The agreement did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows, results of operations or financial position. The Company's 2009 and 2010 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the field examination is expected in 2014. In connection with this examination, the Company agreed to certain adjustments that have been proposed by the IRS and appropriately accounted for these adjustments in accordance with ASC 740. The Company is also under audit in multiple state and foreign tax jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the audits in certain of these jurisdictions could be completed within 12 months. Due to the expected settlement of the 2009 and 2010 IRS agreed adjustments, the possible completion of the aforementioned state and foreign tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next 12 months by $120 million to $140 million , of which $5 million to $10 million could favorably affect the effective tax rate. Also in connection with the Companys 2009 and 2010 U.S. federal income tax returns, the Company received notices of proposed adjustments (\"NOPAs\") in 2014 and expects to receive additional NOPAs within the next 12 months from the IRS related to certain transfer pricing matters. It is reasonably possible that the receipt of these future NOPAs will provide new information that causes the Company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded. In addition, the Company is currently under audit in other tax jurisdictions. Completion of the tax audits for certain jurisdictions is not expected within 12 months. However, it is reasonably possible that, as a result of audit progression within the next 12 months, there may be new information that causes the Company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded. While the Company cannot estimate the impact that new information may have on our unrecognized tax benefit balance, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined under ASC 740. The Company is generally no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2007. The Company had $55.4 million and $37.7 million accrued for interest and penalties at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalties related to tax matters of $14.4 million in 2013 , $11.2 million in 2012 , and $4.8 million in 2011 , which are included in the provision for income taxes. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. These temporary differences were approximately $16.1 billion at December 31, 2013 and consisted primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. Determination of the deferred income tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.  38 McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report ##TABLE_START Segment and Geographic Information  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company operates in the global restaurant industry and manages its business as distinct geographic segments.

Fees and interest rates on this line are based on the Companys long-term credit rating assigned by Moodys and Standard  Poors . In addition, the Company's subsidiaries had unused lines of credit that were primarily uncommitted, short-term and denominated in various currencies at local market rates of interest . The weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings was 5.1% at December 31, 2013 (based on $609.7 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings) and 4.1% at December 31, 2012 (based on $581.3 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings and $200.0 million of commercial paper). DEBT OBLIGATIONS The Company has incurred debt obligations principally through public and private offerings and bank loans. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions, and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. Under certain agreements, the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at par or at a premium over par. The Company has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt prior to maturity. ESOP LOANS Borrowings related to the leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") at December 31, 2013 , which include $23.2 million of loans from the Company to the ESOP, are reflected as debt with a corresponding reduction of shareholders equity (additional paid-in capital included a balance of $19.9 million and $27.2 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively). The ESOP is repaying the loans and interest through 2018 using Company contributions and dividends from its McDonalds common stock holdings . As the principal amount of the borrowings is repaid, the debt and the unearned ESOP compensation (additional paid-in capital) are reduced.

The 401(k) feature allows participants to make pretax contributions that are matched each pay period from shares released under the ESOP. The Profit Sharing and Savings Plan also provides for a discretionary employer profit sharing match after the end of the year for those participants eligible to share in the match. All current account balances and future contributions and related earnings can be invested in several investment alternatives as well as McDonalds common stock in accordance with each participants elections. Participants contributions to the 401(k) feature and the discretionary employer matching contribution feature are limited to 20% investment in McDonalds common stock. Participants may choose to make separate investment choices for current account balances and for future contributions. The Company also maintains certain nonqualified supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan because of IRS limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan.  Total liabilities were $531.1 million at December 31, 2013 , and $493.5 million at December 31, 2012 , and were primarily included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheet. The Company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of the liabilities. At December 31, 2013 , derivatives with a fair value of $128.2 million indexed to the Company's stock and a total return swap with a notional amount of $181.4 million indexed to certain market indices were included at their fair value in Miscellaneous other assets and Prepaid expenses and other current assets, respectively, on the Consolidated balance sheet. Changes in liabilities for these nonqualified plans and in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded primarily in Selling, general  administrative expenses. Changes in fair value of the derivatives indexed to the Companys stock are recorded in the income statement because the contracts provide the counterparty with a choice to settle in cash or shares.  Total U.S. costs for the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan, including nonqualified benefits and related hedging activities, were (in millions): 2013  $21.9 ; 2012  $27.9 ; 2011  $41.3 . Certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. also offer profit sharing, stock purchase or other similar benefit plans. Total plan costs outside the U.S. were (in millions): 2013  $51.2 ; 2012  $62.5 ; 2011  $58.3 . The total combined liabilities for international retirement plans were $75.0 million and $77.7 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Other post-retirement benefits and post- employment benefits were immaterial. 40 McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report ##TABLE_START Share-based Compensation  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company maintains a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plans was 73.1 million at December 31, 2013 , including 46.0 million available for future grants. STOCK OPTIONS Stock options to purchase common stock are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Companys stock on the date of grant. Substantially all of the options become exercisable in four equal installments, beginning a year from the date of the grant, and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. Intrinsic value for stock options is defined as the difference between the current market value of the Companys stock and the exercise price. During 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $325.2 million , $469.8 million and $416.5 million , respectively. Cash received from stock options exercised during 2013 was $233.3 million and the tax benefit realized from stock options exercised totaled $98.9 million . The Company uses treasury shares purchased under the Companys share repurchase program to satisfy share-based exercises. A summary of the status of the Companys stock option grants as of December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , and changes during the years then ended, is presented in the following table: ##TABLE_START       Options Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price   Weighted- average remaining contractual life in years  Aggregate intrinsic value in millions   Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price   Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price  Outstanding at beginning of year 27.4   $ 59.86       31.7   $ 47.77  37.4   $ 42.47 Granted 3.7   94.36       4.9   99.63  3.9   75.97 Exercised (5.7 )   40.12       (8.6 )   38.51  (9.0 )   37.46 Forfeited/expired (0.3 )   79.15       (0.6 )   55.28  (0.6 )   55.00 Outstanding at end of year 25.1   $ 69.15  5.9   $ 713.7  27.4   $ 59.86  31.7   $ 47.77 Exercisable at end of year 15.6   $ 56.43  4.5   $ 638.6  17.1     21.9    ##TABLE_ENDRSUs RSUs generally vest 100% on the third anniversary of the grant and are payable in either shares of McDonalds common stock or cash, at the Companys discretion.

The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: ##TABLE_START I. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START II. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START III. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ##TABLE_END There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may vary over time. Management assessed the design and effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992 Framework). Based on managements assessment using those criteria, as of December 31, 2013 , management believes that the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. Ernst  Young, LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 and the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 . Their reports are presented on the following pages. The independent registered public accountants and internal auditors advise management of the results of their audits, and make recommendations to improve the system of internal controls. Management evaluates the audit recommendations and takes appropriate action.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of McDonalds Corporation at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), McDonalds Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report dated February 24, 2014 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

McDonalds Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report on Managements Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, McDonalds Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of McDonalds Corporation as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 , and our report dated February 24, 2014 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Business  ##TABLE_ENDMcDonalds Corporation, the registrant, together with its sub-sidiaries, is referred to herein as the Company. a. General development of business During 2014 , there were no material changes to the Companys corporate structure or in its method of conducting business. In 2014 , the Company continued the process it began in 2005 to realign certain subsidiaries to develop a corporate structure within its geographic segments that better reflects the operation of the McDonalds worldwide business. b. Financial information about segments Segment data for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 are included in Part II, Item 8, page 42 of this Form 10-K. c. Narrative description of business ##TABLE_START  General ##TABLE_END The Company operates and franchises McDonalds restaurants, which serve a locally-relevant menu of quality food and drinks sold at various affordable price points in more than 100 countries. McDonalds global system is comprised of both Company-owned and franchised restaurants. McDonalds franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures - conventional franchise, developmental license or affiliate. The optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant, trading area or market (country) is based on a variety of factors, including the availability of individuals with the entrepreneurial experience and financial resources, as well as the local legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property ownership and franchising. We continually review, and as appropriate adjust, our mix of Company-owned and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance. The business relationship between McDonalds and its independent franchisees is of fundamental importance to overall performance and to the McDonalds Brand. This business relationship is supported by an agreement that requires adherence to standards and policies essential to protecting our brand. The Company views itself primarily as a franchisor, with the vast majority of McDonalds restaurants (approximately 80%) owned and operated by independent franchisees. Franchising enables an individual to own a restaurant business and maintain control over personnel, purchasing, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of McDonalds global brand, operating system and financial resources. One of the strengths of this model is that the expertise gained from operating Company-owned restaurants allows McDonalds to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and, when viable, efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants. Directly operating McDonalds restaurants contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor. Having Company-owned restaurants is essential to providing Company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience. In addition, in our Company-owned and operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we are able to further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit relevant McDonalds restaurants. Under a conventional franchise arrangement, the Company owns the land and building or secures a long-term lease for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment, signs, seating and dcor. The Company believes that ownership of real estate, combined with the co-investment by franchisees, enables us to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. Franchisees are also responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time. In addition, to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives, the Company frequently co-invests with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or their operating systems. These investments, developed with input from McDonalds with the aim of improving local business performance, increase the value of our Brand through the development of modernized, more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants. The Companys typical franchise term is 20 years. The Company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors. The business relationship with franchisees is designed to assure consistency and high quality at all McDonalds restaurants. Conventional franchisees contribute to the Companys revenue through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees paid upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new franchise. This structure enables McDonalds to generate significant levels of cash flow. Under a developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest. The Company does not invest any capital under a developmental license arrangement. The Company receives a royalty based upon a percent of sales as well as initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license. We use the developmental license ownership structure in over 70 countries with a total of 5,228 restaurants. The largest developmental licensee operates approximately 2,100 restaurants in 19 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Finally, the Company also has an equity investment in a limited number of foreign affiliated markets, referred to as affiliates. In these markets, the Company receives a royalty based on a percent of sales and records its share of net results in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. The largest of these affiliates is Japan, where there are nearly 3,100 restaurants.  ##TABLE_START  Supply Chain and Quality Assurance ##TABLE_END The Company and its franchisees purchase food, packaging, equipment and other goods from numerous independent suppliers. The Company has established and enforces high quality standards and product specifications. The Company has quality centers around the world designed to ensure that its high standards are consistently met. The quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews, but also on-site supplier visits. A quality leadership board, composed of the Companys technical, safety and supply chain specialists, provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food quality and safety. In addition, the Company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation, assure best practices and drive continuous improvement. Leveraging scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies, the Company also collaborates with suppliers toward a goal of achieving competitive, predictable food and paper costs over the long term. Independently owned and operated distribution centers, approved by the Company, distribute products and supplies to McDonalds restaurants. In addition, restaurant personnel are trained in the proper storage, handling and preparation of products.  ##TABLE_START  Products ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu, although there are geographic variations to suit local consumer  McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 1 preferences and tastes. In addition, McDonalds tests new products on an ongoing basis. McDonalds menu includes hamburgers and cheeseburgers, Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Filet-O-Fish, several chicken sandwiches, Chicken McNuggets, wraps, french fries, salads, oatmeal, shakes, McFlurry desserts, sundaes, soft serve cones, pies, soft drinks, coffee, McCaf beverages and other beverages. In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of other products during limited-time promotions. McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. and many international markets offer a full or limited breakfast menu. Breakfast offerings may include Egg McMuffin, Sausage McMuffin with Egg, McGriddles, biscuit and bagel sandwiches and hotcakes. Quality, choice and nutrition are increasingly important to our customers and we are continuously evolving our menu to meet our customers' needs. ##TABLE_START  Marketing ##TABLE_END McDonalds global brand is well known. Marketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed to promote McDonalds brand and differentiate the Company from competitors. Marketing and promotional efforts focus on value, quality, food taste, menu choice, nutrition, convenience and the customer experience. The Company continuously endeavors to improve its social responsibility and environmental practices to achieve long-term sustainability, which benefits McDonalds and the communities it serves.  ##TABLE_START  Intellectual property ##TABLE_END The Company owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information. The Company considers the trademarks McDonalds and The Golden Arches Logo to be of material importance to its business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. Patents, copyrights and licenses are of varying remaining durations.  ##TABLE_START  Seasonal operations ##TABLE_END The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree.  ##TABLE_START  Working capital practices ##TABLE_END Information about the Companys working capital practices is incorporated herein by reference to Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 in Part II, Item 7, pages 12 through 28, and the Consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 in Part II, Item 8, page 32 of this Form 10-K.  ##TABLE_START  Customers ##TABLE_END The Companys business is not dependent upon either a single customer or small group of customers.  ##TABLE_START  Backlog ##TABLE_END Company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders.  ##TABLE_START  Government contracts ##TABLE_END No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government.  ##TABLE_START  Competition ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of food products. The Company competes on the basis of price, convenience, service, menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry. In measuring the Companys competitive position, management reviews data compiled by Euromonitor International, a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry. The Companys primary competition, which management refers to as the informal eating out (\"IEO\") segment, includes the following restaurant categories defined by Euromonitor International: quick-service eating establishments, casual dining full-service restaurants, street stalls or kiosks, cafs,100% home delivery/takeaway providers, specialist coffee shops, self-service cafeterias and juice/smoothie bars. The IEO segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and full-service restaurants other than casual dining. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the global IEO segment was composed of approximately 8 million outlets and generated $1.2 trillion in annual sales in 2013 , the most recent year for which data is available. McDonalds Systemwide 2013 restaurant business accounted for 0.4% of those outlets and 7.5% of the sales. Management also on occasion benchmarks McDonalds against the entire restaurant industry, including the IEO segment defined above and all other full-service restaurants. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 17 million outlets and generated $2.3 trillion in annual sales in 2013 . McDonalds Systemwide restaurant business accounted for 0.2% of those outlets and 3.8% of the sales.  ##TABLE_START  Research and development ##TABLE_END The Company operates research and development facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. While research and development activities are important to the Companys business, these expenditures are not material. Independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the \"System\").  ##TABLE_START  Environmental matters ##TABLE_END Increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives, particularly in the area of climate change. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. Although the impact would likely vary by world region and/or market, we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs for the System. Also, there is a possibility that governmental initiatives, or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns, climate, or water resources could have a direct impact on the operations of our restaurants or the operations of our suppliers in ways which we cannot predict at this time. The Company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner. At this time, the Company has already begun to undertake its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment, including the implementation of more energy efficient equipment and management of energy use and more sustainable sourcing practices in many of its markets.  ##TABLE_START  Number of employees ##TABLE_END The Companys number of employees worldwide, including Company-operated restaurant employees, was approximately 420,000 as of year-end 2014 . 2 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report d.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  ##TABLE_END The information in this report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook. These statements use such words as may, will, expect, believe and plan. They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements. Our business results are subject to a variety of risks that are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance. If we do not successfully design and execute our global growth strategies, we may not be able to increase revenues or market share. To drive future results, our global growth strategies must be effective in achieving market share gains while at the same time delivering operating income growth. Our strategies are aligned around the four strategic growth priorities that represent our greatest opportunities to drive results-serving our customers favorite food and drinks, creating memorable experiences, offering unparalleled convenience, and being a more trusted brand. We focus our System on execution across all of our strategies through a common, integrated approach to people, products, place, price and promotion. Whether we successfully execute these strategies depends mainly on our Systems ability to: ##TABLE_START  Continue to innovate and differentiate in all aspects of the McDonalds experience in a way that balances value with profitability; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Reinvest in our restaurants and identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our Systems plans for net growth of System-wide restaurants; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Provide clean and friendly environments that deliver a consistent McDonald's experience and demonstrate high service levels; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Drive restaurant improvements that achieve optimal capacity, particularly during peak mealtime hours; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Manage the complexity of our restaurant operations. ##TABLE_END If we are unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. We face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business. We compete primarily in the IEO segment, which is highly competitive. In some of our major markets, IEO segments have remained stagnant in recent periods, have experienced only modest growth or have declined. As a result, we are facing sustained, intense competition from both traditional and other competitors, which include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores and coffee shops. In addition, in recent periods we have experienced emerging and growing competition from the fast casual category of restaurants. We expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive and in any particular reporting period our results may be impacted by new actions of our competition, which may have a short- or long-term impact. We compete on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. In particular, we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, develop new products, price our products appropriately, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations and respond effectively to our competitors actions. Recognizing these dependencies, we have intensified our focus in recent periods on strategies to achieve these goals and we will likely continue to modify existing strategies and implement new strategies in the future. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics. If we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences, our business could suffer. Our continued success depends on our Systems ability to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics, trends in food sourcing, food preparation and consumer preferences in the IEO segment. We must continuously adapt to deliver a relevant experience for our customers amidst a highly competitive, value-driven operating environment. Over the last year, we have implemented initiatives to address these shifts at a more aggressive pace. There is no assurance that such initiatives will be successful and, if they are not, our financial results could be adversely impacted.  McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 3 If our pricing, promotional and marketing plans are not effective, our results may be negatively impacted. Our results depend on the impact of our pricing, promotional and marketing plans and our Systems ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly to economic and competitive conditions. Our existing or future pricing strategies and the value proposition they represent will continue to be important components of our overall plan, may not be successful and could negatively impact sales and margins. The promotion of our menu offerings may yield results below desired levels. Additionally, we operate in an increasingly complex and costly advertising environment. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful and we may fail to attract and retain customers. We have increased our emphasis on digital offerings and customer loyalty initiatives, and our success depends in part on whether we can effectively execute such offerings and initiatives in a way that will enhance customer engagement. If our pricing, promotional and marketing plans are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease. Failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have a negative impact on our financial results. To be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brand. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, our business practices and the manner in which we source the commodities we use. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons. For example, nutritional, health and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and often have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the IEO segment or perceptions of our brand and could be material to our business. Perceptions may also be affected by activist campaigns to promote adverse perceptions of the quick-service category of the IEO segment or our brand and/or our operations, or to promote or threaten specific economic action involving the industry, us, our suppliers or franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing such adverse perceptions, our brand and our financial results may suffer. Additionally, the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our sustainability initiatives to support our brand ambition of good food, good people and good neighbor, which will require System-wide coordination and alignment. If we are not effective in achieving our stated sustainability goals and addressing these and other matters of social responsibility in a way that inspires trust and confidence, trust in our brand could suffer. In particular, business incidents that erode consumer trust, particularly if such incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results. Unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions, which can vary significantly by market and can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits. Economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including hostilities, epidemics and actions taken by governments to manage national economic matters, whether through austerity or stimulus measures and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers. Many major economies, both advanced and developing, continue to face weak economies, high unemployment rates and other ongoing economic issues. Continued adverse economic conditions or adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could pressure our operating performance, and our business and financial results may suffer. Supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues. We depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient product supply, including on favorable terms. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world. Supply chain interruptions, including due to lack of supply or price increases, can adversely affect us or the suppliers and franchisees that are also part of our System and whose performance has a significant impact on our results. Such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers or us, including inclement weather, natural disasters, increased demand, problems in production or distribution, disruptions in third party logistics or transportation systems, the inability of our suppliers to obtain credit, or food safety warnings or advisories. If we experience interruptions in our supply chain, our costs could increase and it could limit the availability of products critical to our operations. Food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business. Our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our Systems ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonalds of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future. Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe food products. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. In 2014, food quality issues were discovered at a supplier to McDonalds and other food companies in China. As a consequence of this issue, results in China, Japan and certain other markets were negatively impacted due to lost sales and profitability, including expenses associated with rebuilding customer trust. Any future instances of food tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness could adversely affect our brand and reputation as well as our revenues and profits. Our franchise business model presents a number of risks. Our success relies in part on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, yet we have limited influence over their operations. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: Company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants. Our franchisees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. Our franchisees may not experience sales growth, and our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result. If sales trends worsen for franchisees, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, restaurant closures or delayed or reduced payments to us. Our success also depends on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of our franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general or by the individual franchisee's creditworthiness. Our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or 4 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report other operational problems or project a brand image inconsistent with our values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subject to litigation. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, the brands image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results. Our ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing. Our ability to achieve the benefits of our refranchising strategy, which involves a shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants, will depend on various factors, including our ability to identify franchisees that meet our rigorous standards, the performance of our existing franchisees and whether the resulting ownership mix supports our financial objectives. Changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations. The profitability of our Company-owned restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, including food, paper, supply, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs. Any volatility in certain commodity prices could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability. The commodity market for some of the ingredients we use, such as beef and chicken, is particularly volatile and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, international commodity markets, food safety concerns, product recalls, government regulation and other factors, all of which are beyond our control and, in many instances, unpredictable. We can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities, and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability. The global scope of our operations subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business. We face differing cultural, regulatory and economic environments that exist within and among the more than 100 countries where McDonalds restaurants operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on our success in these environments. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our Systems ability to leverage operating successes across markets. Our initiatives may not have broad appeal with our customer base and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts. Disruptions in our operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or import-export controls, increased tariffs, government-mandated closure of our or our suppliers operations and asset seizures. The cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or actions, whether or not they have merit, may impact our results. Our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brand-building initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental actions. Our results of operations and financial condition are also affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect reported earnings. Additionally, we face challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. For example, our results have been negatively impacted by the ongoing events in the Ukraine and Russia. Such challenges are exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our international operations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Challenges with respect to talent management could harm our business. Our success depends in part on our Systems ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel to manage our operations. For instance, the trend toward higher wages and social expenses could have a negative impact on the margins of our Company-owned restaurants. Additionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us or the franchisees and suppliers that are also part of the McDonalds System and whose performance has a material impact on our results. We are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and overseas regulations affecting our workforce, which includes our staff and employees working in our Company-owned restaurants. These regulations are increasingly focused on wage and hour, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and unlawful workplace discrimination. Our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers (or perceptions thereof) could have a negative impact on our business. Information technology system failures or interruptions or breaches of our network security may interrupt our operations. We are increasingly reliant on our technological systems (e.g., point-of-sale and other in-store systems or platforms) to conduct our business, and any failure of these systems could significantly impact our operations. Despite our implementation of security measures, our technology systems could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. If these systems were to fail, and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we could experience an interruption in our operations. We may also not fully realize the benefits of the significant investments we are making to enhance the customer experience through digital engagement and social media. Furthermore, security breaches involving our systems or those of third party providers may occur, such as unauthorized access, denial of service, computer viruses and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Our information technology systems contain personal, financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. An actual or alleged security breach could result in system disruptions, shutdowns, theft or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. The occurrence of any of these incidents could result in adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, and criminal penalties or civil liabilities. Increasing regulatory complexity may adversely affect restaurant operations and our financial results. Our regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and countries in Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. We are affected by the cost, compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face, including where inconsistent standards  McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 5 imposed by multiple governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings. Our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of new, potential or changing regulations that can affect our business plans. These regulations may relate to product packaging, marketing and the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices (particularly given varying requirements and practices for testing and disclosure), ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants, and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers. Additionally, we are keenly aware of and working to manage the risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, energy and water resources. The increased public focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters (e.g., packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use) and the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them, could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us. Increasing legal complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. We could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, employment and personal injury claims, landlord/tenant disputes, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former franchisees, and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another partys trademarks, copyrights, or patents). Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation. Litigation involving our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law purposes, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. We are also subject to the legal and compliance risks associated with privacy, data collection, protection and management, in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide technology-related services to franchisees. Our operating results could also be affected by the following: ##TABLE_START  The relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The cost and other effects of settlements, judgments or consent decrees, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The scope and terms of insurance or indemnification protections that we may have. ##TABLE_END A judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt our business. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the McDonalds brand and our business. The success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products. We also license our intellectual property to franchisees and we cannot assure you that they will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property. We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the United States in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. In particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, could result in costly litigation and could harm our business. Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world. In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations, particularly if corporate tax reform becomes a key component of budgetary initiatives in the United States and elsewhere. We are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the IRS or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. Any increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Changes in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment charges may adversely affect our future operations and results. New accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could affect our future results. We may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment charges that reduce our earnings. In assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, we may 6 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report be required to record impairment charges. If we experience any such changes, they could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. A decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability. We may be negatively affected by the impact of changes in our debt levels or our results of operations on our credit ratings, interest expense, availability of acceptable counterparties, ability to obtain funding on favorable terms or our operating or financial flexibility, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants. Our operations may also be impacted by regulations affecting capital flows, financial markets or financial institutions, which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs. If any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors. Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these, some of which are outside our control, are the following: ##TABLE_START  The continuing unpredictable global economic and market conditions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the United States which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can be affected by market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete); unauthorized disclosures about our performance, plans or expectations about our business; our actual performance and creditworthiness; investor confidence generally; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonalds may be included, such as the SP 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of our stock repurchase program or dividend rate; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact on our results of other corporate actions, such as those we may take from time to time as part of our continuous review of our corporate structure in light of business, legal and tax considerations. ##TABLE_END Our results and prospects can be adversely affected by events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others. Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels or other factors that affect our results and prospects, such as commodity costs. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

The Company identifies and develops sites that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential to the Company. To assess potential, the Company analyzes traffic and walking patterns, census data and other relevant data. The Companys experience and access to advanced technology aid in evaluating this information. The Company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for restaurant sites, which ensures long-term occupancy rights and helps control related costs. Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to control average development costs through construction and design efficiencies, standardization and by leveraging the Companys global sourcing network.

While the Company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, unfavorable rulings could occur. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on net income for the period in which the ruling occurs or for future periods.  ##TABLE_START  Franchising ##TABLE_END A substantial number of McDonalds restaurants are franchised to independent owner/operators under contractual arrangements with the Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company and its franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects including, but not limited to, quality, service and cleanliness issues, contentions regarding grants or terminations of franchises, delinquent payments of rents and fees, and franchisee claims for additional franchises or rewrites of franchises. Additionally, occasional disputes arise between the Company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a McDonalds franchise.  ##TABLE_START  Suppliers ##TABLE_END The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries generally do not supply food, paper or related items to any McDonalds restaurants. The Company relies upon numerous independent suppliers, including service providers, that are required to meet and maintain the Companys high standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company and its suppliers (or former suppliers) which include, by way of example, compliance with product specifications and the Companys business relationship with suppliers. In addition, disputes occasionally arise on a number of issues between the Company and individuals or entities  McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 7 who claim that they should be (or should have been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the Companys restaurants. ##TABLE_START  Employees ##TABLE_END Hundreds of thousands of people are employed by the Company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, thousands of people from time to time seek employment in such restaurants.

Franchised restaurants represent more than 80% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide. ##TABLE_END  McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 11 ##TABLE_START ", "7": " ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  ##TABLE_ENDOverview DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants. Of the 36,258 restaurants in 119 countries at year-end 2014 , 29,544 were franchised (including 20,774 franchised to conventional franchisees, 5,228 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,542 licensed to foreign affiliates (\"affiliates\")primarily Japan) and 6,714 were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and dcor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees enabling restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants in an effort to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market. We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is paramount to both delivering great, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. Franchising enables an individual to own a restaurant business and maintain control over personnel, purchasing, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the financial strength and global experience of McDonald's. However, directly operating restaurants is important to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In our Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. We continually review, and as appropriate adjust, our mix of Company-operated and franchised (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and foreign affiliated) restaurants to help optimize overall performance. The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (\"U.S.\"), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (\"APMEA\"). In addition, throughout this report we present Other Countries  Corporate that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 32% , 40% and 23% of total revenues, respectively. The United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), France, Russia and Germany, collectively, account for 68% of Europes revenues; and China, Australia and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for 52% of APMEAs revenues. These seven markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise 75% of total revenues. In analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, operating income growth and returns. ##TABLE_START  Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases most incentive compensation plans on these results because we believe this better represents the Companys underlying business trends. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the Companys initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Typically, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. The goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. ##TABLE_END McDonalds reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have a more pronounced effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal. ##TABLE_START  Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Companys financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Return on incremental invested capital (\"ROIIC\") is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. ##TABLE_END12 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the \"System\") has been key to McDonald's long-term success. By leveraging our System, we are able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. In addition, our business model enables McDonald's to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve. McDonald's customer-focused Plan to Win (\"Plan\") provides a common framework that aligns our global business and allows for local adaptation through an emphasis on the Plan's five pillars - People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion. In 2014, we evolved our Plan framework, refocusing our planning and actions on what matters most to our customers. The following four strategic growth priorities support our global Plan: ##TABLE_START  Optimizing our menu so that we offer our customers more of their favorite food and drinks; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Modernizing the customer experience so interactions with the Brand are more memorable; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Broadening accessibility to deliver unparalleled convenience; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Taking meaningful actions to become an even more trusted brand. ##TABLE_END We believe that our strategic growth priorities align with our customers' evolving needs and - combined with our competitive advantages of convenience, scale, geographic diversification and System alignment  - will enhance our customers experience and build shareholder value over the long-term. To measure our performance as we strive to build the business, we have the following long-term, average annual constant currency financial targets: ##TABLE_START  Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating income growth of 6% to 7%; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ROIIC in the high teens. ##TABLE_END In 2014, our results were disappointing as unforeseen events and weak operating performance pressured results in each of our geographic segments. Systemwide sales decreased 2% (increased 1% in constant currencies), operating income decreased 9% (8% in constant currencies), one-year ROIIC was negative 21.9% and three-year ROIIC was 1.4% (see reconciliation on page 27). Each metric fell below our long-term financial targets, reflecting the impact of soft comparable sales performance and cost pressures, negatively impacting all segments. Given our heavily franchised business model, growing comparable sales is vital to increasing the Company's operating income and returns. We experienced challenges growing sales and guest counts in 2014, as comparable sales decreased 1.0%, reflecting negative guest traffic in all segments. While some of the challenges were anticipated, others were not, such as the impact of a supplier issue in China, Japan and certain other markets (see explanation under APMEA) and the volatile operating environment in Russia and the Ukraine. Results were also impacted by under-performance in key opportunity markets that are significant contributors to consolidated results, most notably the U.S. We anticipate many of these challenges will persist in 2015, particularly in the first half of the year; however, we continue to believe that our long-term financial targets remain achievable over the long term, keeping us focused on making the best decisions for the benefit of our shareholders and our System. We are intensely focused on increasing customer relevance, driving customer visits, and positioning the Company for future growth. In 2014, we took a number of important steps to lay the foundation for our turnaround. The following is a summary of our sales performance and critical actions taken to advance our longer-term strategies by major segment. U.S. In the U.S., comparable sales declined 2.1% and comparable guest counts declined 4.1%. Guest visits were down as customer-focused initiatives did not resonate strongly amid the increasingly competitive marketplace and sluggish industry growth. To enhance customer relevance and loyalty, the U.S. is focused on addressing menu, service and value opportunities. In 2014, we brought in new leadership to provide innovative thinking and a fresh strategic perspective, and we announced actions to create a flatter, more nimble U.S. organization that places greater decision making and accountability closer to the customer. Menu strategies included a focus on continued growth at breakfast, which remains our strongest daypart, and an ongoing emphasis on core food and beverages. In addition, we executed initiatives to build brand trust through strengthened marketing efforts, including the launch of a national food quality campaign. The U.S. focused on improving the service experience through an increased emphasis on operations excellence and investments made in establishing our digital platform, including being the first in our industry to accept Apple Pay in the drive-thru. We continued to invest in new and existing restaurants by opening 222 new restaurants and reimaging approximately 260 locations, of which the majority added or enhanced drive-thru capacity. Currently, about half of our restaurant interiors and exteriors reflect our contemporary restaurant design. We evolved our value platform to reposition entry-level affordability for future growth by providing a means to transition products to a higher price point when appropriate. Europe In Europe, comparable sales declined 0.6%, while comparable guest counts declined 2.2%. Comparable sales reflected negative performance in Germany and Russia, mostly offset by positive performance in the UK. Low consumer confidence and other external issues related to the operating environment in Russia and Ukraine negatively impacted business performance. In 2014, we pursued customer-focused initiatives to deliver menu variety, a contemporary restaurant experience and value enhancements. We further optimized our menu through premium menu additions and expanded our McCaf platform with over 4,000 restaurants now serving blended ice beverages. We remain committed to reinvesting in existing restaurants through reimaging and technology initiatives to provide a relevant, contemporary customer experience. Europe completed about 260 restaurant reimages during the year. By the end of 2014, nearly 100% of restaurant interiors and 85% of exteriors were modernized. We continued to leverage technology, with over 2,000 self-order kiosks and mobile ordering and payment capability available in certain markets. We increased our accessibility and convenience through daypart expansion, including breakfast and overnight, opening approximately 320 new restaurants, and optimizing our drive-thrus. As value is paramount to European customers, we continued to evolve and emphasize value offerings at every price tier.  McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 13 APMEA In APMEA, comparable sales declined 3.3% and comparable guest counts declined 4.7% due to negative performance in Japan and China. This was slightly offset by positive results in Australia, the first of our priority markets to demonstrate signs of recovery due to strengthened marketing, re-emphasized value, menu improvements and stronger franchisee alignment . In mid-July, food quality issues were discovered at a supplier to McDonalds and other food companies in China, negatively impacting results in China, Japan and certain other markets. We moved quickly to source from alternative suppliers and initiated aggressive recovery plans to restore consumer trust and confidence. As a result of our efforts, sales trends in China are showing signs of improvement. McDonald's Japan is not recovering as quickly and has been working to overcome significant challenges. We continued to make progress in our reimaging program, completing about 340 restaurant reimages during the year. By the end of 2014, over 70% of restaurant interiors and over 60% of exteriors were modernized. We are committed to ongoing restaurant expansion, although the pace of new openings was slowed in China in response to local market dynamics. We opened 655 new restaurants, including 227 in China. Global Globally, we have been focused on strengthening the foundational elements of our business, namely value across the menu, marketing and operations excellence to deliver a better customer experience while actively pursuing comprehensive initiatives to capture the sizeable longer-term growth opportunities in our industry. Even in periods of softer performance, McDonalds unique business model and structure enable us to generate significant cash flows. Cash from operations benefits from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income we receive from franchisees provides a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs and enables us to return significant cash to shareholders. In addition, the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the Company-owned model.  We believe locally-owned and operated restaurants are important to McDonald's being not just a global brand, but also a locally-relevant one. In 2014, cash from operations totaled $6.7 billion. Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provided us flexibility to invest in critical growth initiatives while still returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures of approximately $2.6 billion were invested in our business, of which more than half was devoted to new restaurant openings and the remainder was reinvested in our existing restaurants. Across the System, 1,316 restaurants were opened and about 930 existing locations were reimaged. As part of our ongoing commitment to build long-term shareholder value, in May 2014, the Company announced a 3-year cash return target of $18 to $20 billion between 2014 and 2016 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, representing a 10% to 20% increase over the amount of cash returned between 2011 and 2013.  This target is based on several activities including the significant free cash flow generated from our operations, as well as the use of cash proceeds from our debt additions and refranchising at least 1,500 restaurants over the 2014-2016 period (over 400 restaurants were refranchised in 2014), primarily in APMEA and Europe. In 2014, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders consisting of $3.2 billion in dividends and $3.2 billion in share repurchases and remain on track to meet our 3-year target. RESULTS FOR THE YEAR: ##TABLE_START  Global comparable sales decreased 1.0%, reflecting a decrease in all segments with the exception of Other Countries  Corporate, while comparable guest counts declined 3.6%, reflecting negative guest traffic in all segments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consolidated revenues decreased 2% (flat in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consolidated operating income decreased 9% (8% in constant currencies), primarily due to the impact of the supplier issue in APMEA and weak operating performance in the U.S. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company's effective tax rate was 35.5%, including an increase in reserves related to certain foreign tax matters. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted earnings per share was $4.82, a decrease of 13% (11% in constant currencies). The following items, which total $0.54 per share, negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by 10% (10% in constant currencies) for the year: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * $0.31 per share due to an increase in reserves related to certain foreign tax matters; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * $0.23 per share due to the estimated impact of the supplier issue resulting from lost sales and profitability in APMEA. ##TABLE_END Excluding the impact of these items, earnings per share for the year would have been down 3% (1% in constant currencies) compared to the prior year. ##TABLE_START  Cash provided by operations was $6.7 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  One-year ROIIC was negative 21.9% and three-year ROIIC was 1.4% for the period ended December 31, 2014  (see reconciliation on page 27), reflecting the impact of lower operating income in 2014. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 5% to $0.85 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $3.40 per share. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company returned $6.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, in connection with our $18-$20 billion, 3-year cash return target for the years 2014-2016. ##TABLE_END OUTLOOK FOR 2015  McDonald's begins 2015 taking decisive action to drive foundational improvements in our major markets and executing our recovery efforts in markets affected by unforeseen events. While we expect pressures on operating performance to persist as we continue to face significant headwinds, particularly in the first half of the year, sizable growth opportunities exist in the $1.2 trillion global IEO segment. We are committed to pursuing these opportunities by relentlessly focusing on the customer and adapting to the changing marketplace through the following initiatives. We are redefining menu choice and personalization, exploring solutions that will provide our guests a customizable restaurant experience. We are also focused on enhancing the appeal of our core products and addressing food perceptions by improving and highlighting the quality of our ingredients and engaging with our customers in more transparent dialogue. Convenience continues to be a cornerstone of McDonald's business, and we will evolve our value platform, strategically evaluating pricing relationships across the entry level, core and premium tiers. Service elements focus on hospitality and 14 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report additional ways to serve customers, such as self-order kiosks and table service, and in-store pick up or in-car delivery in certain markets. Our digital strategy is built around improving the customer experience and customer engagement.  Collectively, these customer-focused initiatives represent the Restaurant Experience of the Future and build upon investments we have already made in reimaging and technology. The Company is investing in these significant initiatives in a disciplined manner, by partly redirecting GA dollars from the U.S. business and Corporate toward these long-term growth initiatives.   We will continue to invest in geographically diversified new restaurant development and reimaging of our existing restaurants interiors and exteriors. Our 2015 capital expenditure plan of approximately $2.0 billion - our lowest capital budget in more than 5 years - demonstrates financial discipline as we strategically target fewer openings in our most challenged markets. We believe this lower level of capital spending is prudent while we work to regain our business momentum. McDonalds remains committed to growing our business sustainably and making a positive difference in society by serving good food through good people, and being a good neighbor in the communities in which we operate. U.S. The U.S. begins 2015 with new leadership focused on a strategic roadmap including a revamped marketing approach, greater customization, localization and menu simplification. Our revamped marketing approach includes a new national brand campaign complemented by local advertising that is more responsive to individual market preferences. We plan to execute initiatives that are designed to address customer insights and the competitive dynamics that are unique to each market. We are focused on strengthening our menu pipeline by providing more choice and customization, with plans to begin expanding the Create Your Taste platform in 2015. Our menu initiatives also include plans to enhance core products, particularly in the chicken and beef categories. We are also refining our value proposition to offer the right balance of value and choice and to create more logical relationships across menu price tiers. We plan to open about 125 new restaurants and reimage approximately 100 existing restaurants in 2015. Europe The segment's prolonged economic slowdown is expected to continue to impact business performance in 2015. In addition, the IEO landscape remains sluggish and highly competitive. Despite these challenges, we are focusing on those areas within our control to grow sales and traffic. Menu plans include balancing a strong track record of successful promotions with an ongoing focus on our iconic core favorites. We are pursuing opportunities to grow the breakfast, overnight and family businesses. As value remains paramount to customers in the current environment , we are evolving value offerings and  messaging, particularly in key markets like Germany and France. We plan to leverage investments in reimaging, integrated kitchen  platforms and other technology-enabled solutions to support the Restaurant Experience of the Future. We are also pursuing refranchising opportunities, new restaurant growth and expanded drive-thru capabilities. We plan to open about 250 new restaurants and reimage approximately 350 existing restaurants in 2015. APMEA In APMEA, our 2015 initiatives focus on menu variety, value evolution and enhanced convenience. In addition, we are aggressively executing multi-faceted brand recovery efforts in China, Japan and certain other markets. Menu strategies include leveraging core favorites, introducing new flavors particularly in beverages and pursuing opportunities to accelerate the breakfast daypart. Further, customization and personalization is a priority as Australia will be a lead market to roll-out Create Your Taste across the majority of its restaurants in 2015. We will focus on providing customers unparalleled convenience by offering consistent and relevant value options across the menu and expansion of brand extensions, including kiosks, delivery and drive-thrus. Our efforts around reimaging will continue as we expect to modernize approximately 400 existing restaurants. Our plan is to open around 550 new restaurants, with over 200 expected in China. In addition, we will refranchise restaurants to both conventional franchisees and developmental licensees. Consolidated Outlook In making capital allocation decisions, our goal is to prioritize our spending on initiatives that elevate the McDonald's experience and drive sustainable long-term growth in sales and market share. We focus on markets that generate strong returns or have opportunities for long-term growth. While the Company does not provide specific guidance on diluted earnings per share, the following information is provided to assist in forecasting the Company's future results: ##TABLE_START  Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 2 percentage points to 2015 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 829 net restaurants (981 net traditional openings less 152 net satellite closings) added in 2014. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 4 cents. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  With about 75% of McDonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company's commodity costs. For the full year 2015, the total basket of goods cost is expected to increase 1.5-2.5% in the U.S. and Europe. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects full-year 2015 selling, general and administrative expenses to increase approximately 7%-8% in constant currencies, primarily due to higher incentive-based compensation reflecting the impact of below target performance in 2014. Excluding the incremental incentive-based compensation, selling, general and administrative expenses would increase approximately 1%-2%, due to costs associated with expansion of the Restaurant Experience of the Future global initiatives, including our digital strategy. Fluctuations between quarters may occur. ##TABLE_END  McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 15 ##TABLE_START  Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full-year 2015 to increase slightly compared with 2014. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  A significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 25 cents. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2015 to be 31% to 33%. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects capital expenditures for 2015 to be approximately $2.0 billion. About half of this amount will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open more than 1,000 restaurants including about 450 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of between 600-700 restaurants. The remaining capital will be used to reinvest in existing locations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company has established a 3-year cash return target of $18-$20 billion for 2014 to 2016. This target is based on several ongoing factors, including the significant free cash flow generated from our operations, as well as the use of cash proceeds from debt additions and refranchising of at least 1,500 restaurants. ##TABLE_END16 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report Consolidated Operating Results ##TABLE_START Operating results           Dollars and shares in millions, except per share data  Amount  Increase/ (decrease)   Amount  Increase/ (decrease)   Amount Revenues             Sales by Company-operated restaurants  $ 18,169  (4 %)   $ 18,875  %   $ 18,603 Revenues from franchised restaurants  9,272    9,231    8,964 Total revenues  27,441  (2 )   28,106    27,567 Operating costs and expenses             Company-operated restaurant expenses  15,288  (2 )   15,579    15,224 Franchised restaurants-occupancy expenses  1,697    1,624    1,527 Selling, general  administrative expenses  2,488    2,386  (3 )   2,455 Other operating (income) expense, net   n/m   (247 )  (2 )   (244 ) Total operating costs and expenses  19,492   19,342    18,962 Operating income  7,949  (9 )   8,764    8,605 Interest expense        Nonoperating (income) expense, net   (82 )    n/m   Income before provision for income taxes  7,372  (10 )   8,204    8,079 Provision for income taxes  2,614    2,618    2,614 Net income  $ 4,758  (15 %)   $ 5,586  %   $ 5,465 Earnings per common sharediluted  $ 4.82  (13 %)   $ 5.55  %   $ 5.36 Weighted-average common shares outstanding diluted  986.3  (2 %)   1,006.0  (1 %)   1,020.2 ##TABLE_ENDn/m Not meaningful IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonalds mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing goods and services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows. In 2014, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results due to the weaker Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar and certain other currencies, partly offset by the stronger British Pound. In 2013, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results due to the weaker Australian Dollar, Japanese Yen and many other foreign currencies, partly offset by the stronger Euro. In 2012, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results primarily due to the weaker Euro, along with most other currencies.

Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.12 on diluted earnings per share. The following items, which total $0.54 per share, negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by 10% (10% in constant currencies) in 2014: ##TABLE_START  $0.31 per share due to an increase in tax reserves for 2003-2010 resulting from an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction, as well as an increase in tax reserves related to audit progression in other foreign tax jurisdictions. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $0.23 per share due to the estimated impact of the previously-disclosed supplier issue in China. In mid-July, food quality issues were discovered at a supplier to McDonald's and other food companies in China. As a consequence, results in China, Japan and certain other markets were negatively impacted due to lost sales and profitability, including expenses associated with customer recovery efforts. ##TABLE_END Excluding the impact of these items, diluted earnings per share would have been down 3% (1% in constant currencies) compared to 2013. This supplemental information is provided to assist investors in understanding the impact of recent events on the Company's results.  McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 17 In 2013, net income increased 2% (3% in constant currencies) to $5.6 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 4% (4% in constant currencies) to $5.55. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.05 on diluted earnings per share. Net income and diluted earnings per share growth in constant currencies were positively impacted by higher franchised margin dollars, and to a lesser extent, lower selling, general and administrative expenses. This was partly offset by lower Company-operated margin dollars. The Company repurchased 33.1 million shares of its stock for $3.2 billion in 2014 and 18.7 million shares of its stock for $1.8 billion in 2013 , driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share. ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_ENDREVENUES The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. In 2014 , constant currency revenue was flat compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of negative comparable sales, partially offset by expansion. In 2013 , constant currency revenue growth was due to expansion. Weak comparable sales reflected a muted response to customer-facing initiatives amid a highly competitive and sluggish IEO segment across many markets. ##TABLE_START Revenues   Amount   Increase/(decrease)   Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation  Dollars in millions        Company-operated sales:               U.S.  $ 4,351  $ 4,512  $ 4,530  (4 %)  %  (4 %)  % Europe  7,808  8,138  7,850  (4 )    APMEA  5,270  5,425  5,350  (3 )   (2 )  Other Countries  Corporate     (7 )  (8 )  (1 )  (6 ) Total  $ 18,169  $ 18,875  $ 18,603  (4 %)  %  (1 %)  % Franchised revenues:               U.S.  $ 4,300  $ 4,339  $ 4,284  (1 %)  %  (1 %)  % Europe  3,270  3,162  2,977     APMEA  1,054  1,052  1,041     Other Countries  Corporate     (4 )    Total  $ 9,272  $ 9,231  $ 8,964  %  %  %  % Total revenues:               U.S.  $ 8,651  $ 8,851  $ 8,814  (2 %)  %  (2 %)  % Europe  11,078  11,300  10,827  (2 )    APMEA  6,324  6,477  6,391  (2 )   (1 )  Other Countries  Corporate  1,388  1,478  1,535  (6 )  (4 )   Total  $ 27,441  $ 28,106  $ 27,567  (2 %)  %  %  %                ##TABLE_ENDIn the U.S., revenues decreased in 2014 due to negative comparable sales, reflecting negative comparable guest counts amid ongoing broad-based challenges, including sustained competitive activity. Revenues were relatively flat in 2013 as the positive impact of expansion was offset by negative comparable sales. Europe's constant currency increase in 2014 reflected a benefit from expansion, primarily in Russia, and positive comparable sales in the U.K, mostly offset by negative comparable sales in Russia and Germany, and refranchising in Germany. The 2013 increase in revenues benefited from expansion, primarily in Russia, and positive comparable sales performance in the U.K. and Russia, the segment's two largest Company-operated restaurant markets, partly offset by negative results in Germany. In APMEA, the constant currency decrease in 2014 was driven by negative comparable sales primarily due to the impact of the supplier issue in China and Japan. Results benefited from expansion, partly offset by refranchising in Australia. The constant currency increase in revenues in 2013 was driven by expansion in China and other markets, partly offset by negative comparable sales, primarily in China. 18 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report The following tables present comparable sales, comparable guest counts and Systemwide sales increases/(decreases) : ##TABLE_START Comparable sales and guest count increases/(decreases)                  Sales  Guest Counts  Sales  Guest Counts  Sales  Guest Counts U.S.  (2.1 %)  (4.1 %)  (0.2 %)  (1.6 %)  3.3 %  1.9 % Europe  (0.6 )  (2.2 )  0.0  (1.5 )  2.4  (0.5 ) APMEA  (3.3 )  (4.7 )  (1.9 )  (3.8 )  1.4  2.2 Other Countries  Corporate  6.6  (1.5 )  7.0  0.4  7.7  3.0 Total  (1.0 %)  (3.6 %)  0.2 %  (1.9 %)  3.1 %  1.6 % ##TABLE_ENDIn 2014, comparable guest count performance declined 3.6%.

Franchised margin dollars decreased  $32 million or 0% (increased 1% in constant currencies) in 2014 , reflecting a benefit from expansion and refranchising, offset by negative comparable sales performance.

The decrease in 2013 was due to higher depreciation related to reimaging and weak comparable sales.  McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 19 In Europe, the franchised margin percent decreased in 2014 primarily due to the impact of refranchising and negative comparable sales.  The decrease in 2013 was due to higher rent expense in many markets and weak comparable sales primarily due to Germany. In APMEA, the franchised margin percent decreased in 2014 partly due to the negative impact of the supplier issue in Japan, which reduced Japan's favorable contribution to the segment's margin percent. In addition, higher occupancy costs and refranchising negatively impacted the margin percent. The decrease in 2013 was partly due to Japan's negative sales performance and the impact of the weaker Yen. In addition, the segment was negatively impacted by a decline in Australia's results. In connection with our 2014-2016 cash return target, we plan to refranchise at least 1,500 restaurants by selling company-operated restaurants to conventional franchisees and developmental licensees. While this refranchising activity may have a dilutive effect on the franchised margin percent, it results in higher franchised margin dollars. In addition, the franchised margin percent in APMEA and Other Countries  Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. ##TABLE_START  Company-operated margins ##TABLE_END Company-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants.  Company-operated margin dollars decreased $ 415 million or 13% ( 11% in constant currencies) in 2014 , reflecting weak results across all segments. In 2013 , Company-operated margin dollars decreased $83 million or 2% ( 2% in constant currencies), reflecting weak comparable sales in many markets, which impacted our ability to overcome cost pressures.

The margin percent decreased in 2013 primarily due to higher labor, commodity costs and other operating costs. Europes Company-operated margin percent decreased in 2014 reflecting weaker results in Russia and Ukraine, as a challenging operating environment negatively impacted comparable sales performance and weaker currencies impacted imported commodity costs. The margin percent increased in 2013 due to the positive impact of sales performance in Russia, the U.K. and France, mostly offset by higher commodity and occupancy costs. In APMEA, the Company-operated margin percent decreased in 2014 primarily due to the negative impact of the supplier issue in China and certain other markets .

The increase in 2014 was primarily due to higher employee and other costs, the 2014 Winter Olympics and the Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention, partly offset by a reduction in incentive-based compensation. The decrease in 2013 was due to lower incentive-based compensation, partly offset by higher employee costs.

Resulting gains or losses on sales of restaurant businesses are recorded in operating income because these transactions are a recurring part of our business. Gains on sales of restaurant businesses decreased in 2014 primarily in Australia, China and the U.S. The increase in 2013 was due primarily to more stores sold in Australia compared to 2012. ##TABLE_START  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates ##TABLE_END Unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates, but does not control.

McDonalds share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets is reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased in 2014 and 2013 due to weaker operating results, primarily in Japan. In 2014, Japan's performance was negatively impacted by the supplier issue. ##TABLE_START  Asset dispositions and other expense ##TABLE_END Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for restaurant closings and uncollectible receivables, asset write-offs due to restaurant reinvestment, and other miscellaneous income and expenses. Asset dispositions and other expense increased in 2014 primarily due to higher asset write-offs and lower other income items in the U.S., and charges related to the supplier issue in China. The decrease in 2013 was due to the favorable resolution of certain liabilities and lower asset retirements, partly offset by lower gains on property sales and unconsolidated partnership dissolutions. ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_ENDOPERATING INCOME Operating income ##TABLE_START  Amount   Increase/(decrease)   Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation  Dollars in millions       U.S. $ 3,523  $ 3,779  $ 3,751  (7 %)  %  (7 %)  % Europe 3,280  3,371  3,196  (3 )   (2 )  APMEA 1,066  1,480  1,566  (28 )  (6 )  (25 )  Other Countries  Corporate    (40 )    Total $ 7,949  $ 8,764  $ 8,605  (9 %)  %  (8 %)  % ##TABLE_ENDIn the U.S., results for 2014 decreased due to lower restaurant margin dollars, lower other operating income and higher selling, general and administrative expenses.

In Europe, results for 2014 decreased primarily due to lower Company-operated margin dollars in Russia and Ukraine, partly offset by higher franchised margin dollars. The year was also negatively impacted by selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the 2014 Winter Olympics. Results for 2013 were driven by higher franchised and Company-operated margin dollars . In APMEA, results for 2014 decreased primarily due to the supplier issue impacting results in China, Japan and certain other markets by an estimated $290 million.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES In 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , the reported effective income tax rates were 35.5% , 31.9% and 32.4%, respectively. In 2014, the higher effective income tax rate was primarily due to a change in tax reserves for 2003-2010 resulting from an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction, as well as the impact of changes in tax reserves related to audit progression in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions. Excluding these items, the effective income tax rate would have been 31.4%. In 2013, the effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of nearly $50 million, reflecting the retroactive impact of certain tax benefits as a result of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. In 2012, the effective income tax rate reflected the negative impact of certain tax benefits in the U.S. that had expired at December 31, 2011 and were reinstated retroactively in 2013 as noted above. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.6 billion in 2014 and $1.5 billion in 2013 . Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance codified in Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, \"Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" which amends the guidance in ASC 605, \"Revenue Recognition,\" and becomes effective beginning January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASC 606. ##TABLE_START Cash Flows  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $6.7 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.1 billion in 2014, while cash provided by operations totaled $7.1 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.3 billion in 2013. In 2014, cash provided by operations decreased $390 million or 5% compared with 2013 primarily due to lower operating results, partly offset by lower income tax payments. In 2013, cash provided by operations increased $155 million or 2% compared with 2012 primarily due to increased operating results. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.3 billion in 2014, a decrease of $369 million compared with 2013. The decrease primarily reflected lower capital expenditures, a decrease in other investing activities related to short-term time deposits and higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.7 billion in 2013, a decrease of $493 million compared with 2012. The decrease primarily reflected lower capital expenditures and a decrease in other investing activities related to short-term time deposits. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.6 billion in 2014, an increase of $575 million compared with 2013, primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases, partly offset by an increase in net borrowings. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.0 billion in 2013, an increase of $193 million compared with 2012, primarily due to lower net debt issuances and higher dividend payments, partly offset by lower treasury stock purchases. The Companys cash and equivalents balance was $2.1 billion and $2.8 billion at year end 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In 2014, the Company opened 1,298 traditional restaurants and 18 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 317 traditional restaurants and 170 satellite restaurants. In 2013, the Company opened 1,393 traditional restaurants and 45 satellite restaurants and closed 295 traditional restaurants and 194 satellite restaurants. The majority of restaurant openings and closings occurred in the major markets in both years. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.

Over 80% of the restaurants at year-end 2014 were franchised. 22 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report Capital expenditures decreased $242 million or 9% in 2014, primarily due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants. Capital expenditures decreased $224 million or 7% in 2013, primarily due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants, partly offset by higher investment in new restaurants. In both years, the lower reinvestment primarily reflected fewer planned reimages. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented over 70% of the total in 2014, 2013 and 2012.

Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $3.2 million in 2014. The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2014 and 2013. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS For 2014 through 2016, the Company expects to return $18 to $20 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, subject to business and market conditions. In 2014, the Company returned approximately $6.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends paid and shares repurchased.

In May 2014, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the 2012 program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program, effective July 1, 2014, that authorizes the purchase of up to $10 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. In 2014, approximately 33.1 million shares were repurchased for $3.2 billion, of which approximately 20.5 million shares or $1.9 billion were repurchased under the new program. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 39 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2014 full year dividend of $ 3.28 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.81 per share, with an increase to $0.85 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 5% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $3.40 per share annual dividend and reflects the Companys confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors. ##TABLE_START Financial Position and Capital Resources  ##TABLE_ENDTOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS Total assets decreased $2.3 billion or 6% in 2014.

Net property and equipment decreased $1.2 billion in 2014, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation and depreciation, partly offset by capital expenditures, and represented about 70% of total assets at year end. Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity.

McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 23 FINANCING AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2014 totaled $15.0 billion, compared with $14.1 billion at December 31, 2013. The net increase in 2014 was primarily due to net issuances of $1.5 billion partly offset by changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt of $663 million.

Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Under existing authorization from the Companys Board of Directors, at December 31, 2014, the Company had $4.5 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $2.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2015 is approximately $1.1 billion of long-term corporate debt. In 2015, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. As of December 31, 2014, the Company's subsidiaries also had $863 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $5.9 billion and $5.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Companys restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2014, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position. The Companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures ##TABLE_START In millions of U.S. Dollars  Euro $ 4,949  $ 7,302 Australian Dollars 2,038  1,933 British Pounds Sterling 1,460  1,479 Canadian Dollars 1,231  1,412 Japanese Yen  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2014 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2014 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. LIQUIDITY The Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where we earn over 60% of our operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, 24 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. Accordingly, no U.S. federal or state income taxes have been provided on these undistributed foreign earnings. The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2014 . We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds. Consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities. In the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future. While the likelihood is remote, to the extent foreign cash is available, the Company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits), which could result in a use of cash. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. Refer to the Income Taxes note to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Companys borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2014 . See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details. ##TABLE_START  Contractual cash outflows   Contractual cash inflows  In millions Operating leases   Debt obligations (1)   Minimum rent under franchise arrangements   $ 1,382      $ 2,652  1,289   $   2,568  1,163   1,069   2,461  1,044   1,005   2,353    2,979   2,254 Thereafter  7,335   9,101   18,114 Total  $ 13,160   $ 14,985   $ 30,402 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The maturities include reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $2.2 billion , as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in December 2019. Debt obligations do not include $5 million of noncash fair value hedging adjustments or $234 million of accrued interest. ##TABLE_ENDIn the U.S., the Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") limitations. At December 31, 2014 , total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $534 million . In addition, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $988 million at December 31, 2014 . There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. The amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the Companys financial position. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows. ##TABLE_START Other Matters  ##TABLE_ENDCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: ##TABLE_START  Property and equipment ##TABLE_END Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. ##TABLE_START  Share-based compensation ##TABLE_END The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Companys stock over the expected  McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 25 life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. ##TABLE_START  Long-lived assets impairment review ##TABLE_END Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Companys experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Companys estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual country) with risk of material goodwill impairment. ##TABLE_START  Litigation accruals ##TABLE_END In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. ##TABLE_START  Income taxes ##TABLE_END The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. In 2014, the Company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior years by $505 million, most of which came from foreign-related tax matters. After considering the impact of deferred tax offsets, interest and penalties, these foreign-related tax matters impacted the effective tax rate by 4.1%. See the Income Taxes footnote in the  Consolidated Financial Statements for the related tax reconciliations. The most significant new developments in 2014 are described below. In 2014, the Company received an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction related to exempt income matters. As a result of this new information, the Company changed its judgment on the sustainability of this tax position for 2003-2010 and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $188 million. The Company intends to pursue all available remedies to defend this tax position. In addition, the Company received new information from tax authorities during the progression of tax audits in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions, including the receipt of proposed tax assessments primarily related to transfer pricing matters. As a result of this new information, the Company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $207 million. The Company settled certain of these tax audits in 2014 and plans to defend its position with the tax authorities on the remaining audits. Also in 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its field examination of the Companys U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. In connection with this examination, the Company agreed to certain adjustments proposed by the IRS. The liabilities previously recorded related to these adjustments were adequate. In connection with this examination, the Company also received notices of proposed adjustments (\"NOPAs\") related to certain transfer pricing matters and engaged in audit defense discussions with the IRS. As a result of this new information, the Company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $38 million. The Company disagrees with these proposed adjustments and will file a protest with the IRS Appeals Office in 2015. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with Topic 740 - Income Taxes of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). In 2012, the IRS completed its examination of the Company's U.S. federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. The Company and the IRS reached an agreement on adjustments that had been previously proposed by the IRS. The agreement did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows, results of operations or financial position. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $15.4 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management's intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICESINFLATION The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. 26 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report RECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL ROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of our markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Companys incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period. The denominator is the weighted-average cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. The weighted-average cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarters investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2014 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2014 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2013 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full-year impact on 2014 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2013 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Cash used for investing activities can vary significantly by quarter, resulting in a weighted-average that may be higher or lower than the simple average of the periods presented. Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows: One-year ROIIC calculation (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Increase/ (decrease)  NUMERATOR:       Operating income $ 7,949.2  $ 8,764.3   $ (815.1 ) Depreciation and amortization 1,644.5  1,585.1   59.4 Currency translation (1)      152.0 Change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ (603.7 ) DENOMINATOR:       Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (2)      $ 2,769.2 Currency translation (1)      (12.2 ) Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 2,757.0 One-year ROIIC      (21.9 )% ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Represents one-year weighted-average cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the cash used for investing activities for each quarter in the two-year period ended December 31, 2014 . ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,     Cash used for investing activities  $ 2,304.9  $ 2,673.8 AS A PERCENT     Quarters ended:     March 31  87.5 %  12.5 % June 30  62.5  37.5 September 30  37.5  62.5 December 31  12.5  87.5 ##TABLE_ENDThree-year ROIIC calculation (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Increase/ (decrease)  NUMERATOR:       Operating income $ 7,949.2  $ 8,529.7   $ (580.5 ) Depreciation and amortization 1,644.5  1,415.0   229.5 Currency translation (3)      473.6 Change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 122.6 DENOMINATOR:       Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (4)      $ 8,547.2 Currency translation (3)      6.3 Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 8,553.5 Three-year ROIIC      1.4 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Represents three-year weighted-average cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the cash used for investing activities for each quarter in the four-year period ended December 31, 2014 . ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,   2013 2011 Cash used for investing activities $ 2,304.9 $ 2,673.8 $ 3,167.3 $ 2,570.9 AS A PERCENT     Quarters ended:     March 31 87.5 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 12.5 % June 30 62.5 100.0 100.0 37.5 September 30 37.5 100.0 100.0 62.5 December 31 12.5 100.0 100.0 87.5 ##TABLE_END McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 27 RISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook for 2015 .

McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 33 ##TABLE_START Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  ##TABLE_ENDSummary of Significant Accounting Policies NATURE OF BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants in the global restaurant industry. All restaurants are operated either by the Company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchise arrangements, and foreign affiliates and developmental licensees under license agreements. The following table presents restaurant information by ownership type: ##TABLE_START Restaurants at December 31,   Conventional franchised 20,774  20,355  19,869 Developmental licensed 5,228  4,747  4,350 Foreign affiliated 3,542  3,589  3,663 Franchised 29,544  28,691  27,882 Company-operated 6,714  6,738  6,598 Systemwide restaurants 36,258  35,429  34,480 ##TABLE_ENDThe results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees were not material either individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale. CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily McDonalds Japan) are accounted for by the equity method. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers, and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the variable interest entity consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented. ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and foreign affiliates. Sales by Company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis. The Company presents sales net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and may include initial fees. Continuing rent and royalties are recognized in the period earned. Initial fees are recognized upon opening of a restaurant or granting of a new franchise term, which is when the Company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise arrangement. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance codified in Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, \"Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" which amends the guidance in ASC 605, \"Revenue Recognition,\" and becomes effective beginning January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASC 606. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Generally, the functional currency of operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency. ADVERTISING COSTS Advertising costs included in operating expenses of Company-operated restaurants primarily consist of contributions to advertising cooperatives and were (in millions): 2014  $808.2 ; 2013  $808.4 ; 2012  $787.5 . Production costs for radio and television advertising are expensed when the commercials are initially aired. These production costs, primarily in the U.S., as well as other marketing-related expenses included in Selling, general  administrative expenses were (in millions): 2014  $98.7 ; 2013  $75.4 ; 2012  $113.5 . Costs related to the Olympics sponsorship are included in these expenses for 2014 and 2012. In addition, significant advertising costs are incurred by franchisees through contributions to advertising cooperatives in individual markets. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Share-based compensation includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value. Share-based compensation expense and the effect on diluted earnings per common share were as follows: ##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data   Share-based compensation expense $ 112.8  $ 89.1  $ 93.4 After tax $ 72.8  $ 60.6  $ 63.2 Earnings per common share-diluted $ 0.08  $ 0.06  $ 0.06 ##TABLE_ENDCompensation expense related to share-based awards is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in Selling, general  administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2014 , there was $97.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for the 2014 , 2013 and 2012 stock option grants. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical trends. Expected stock price volatility is generally based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock for a period approximating the expected life. The expected dividend yield is based on the Companys most recent annual dividend rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life. Weighted-average assumptions ##TABLE_START  2013 Expected dividend yield 3.3 % 3.5 % 2.8 % Expected stock price volatility 20.0 % 20.6 % 20.8 % Risk-free interest rate 2.0 % 1.2 % 1.1 % Expected life of options (in years) 6.1 6.1 6.1 Fair value per option granted $ 12.23 $ 11.09 $ 13.65 ##TABLE_END34 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildingsup to 40 years; leasehold improvements the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms , which generally include certain option periods; and equipment three to 12 years. GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurant businesses. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of McDonald's restaurants from franchisees and ownership increases in subsidiaries or affiliates, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit (defined as each individual country). The Company conducts goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever an indicator of impairment exists. If an indicator of impairment exists (e.g., estimated earnings multiple value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value), the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit, generally based on discounted future cash flows, with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the carrying amount of goodwill. Historically, goodwill impairment has not significantly impacted the consolidated financial statements. The following table presents the 2014 activity in goodwill by segment: ##TABLE_START In millions U.S.  Europe APMEA (1)  Other Countries  Corporate (2)  Consolidated  Balance at December 31, 2013 $ 1,293.6  $ 958.1  $ 428.7  $ 192.3  $ 2,872.7 Net restaurant purchases (sales) 2.2  16.8  (0.2 )  15.1  33.9 Currency translation   (126.2 )  (27.8 )  (17.3 )  (171.3 ) Balance at December 31, 2014 $ 1,295.8  $ 848.7  $ 400.7  $ 190.1  $ 2,735.3 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) APMEA represents Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Other Countries  Corporate represents Canada, Latin America and Corporate. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDLONG-LIVED ASSETS Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing McDonalds restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together in the U.S. at a television market level, and internationally, at a country level. The Company manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurants cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment (e.g., negative operating cash flows for the most recent trailing 24 -month period) exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows. Losses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal, the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses relate to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered available for sale. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, and certain non-financial assets and liabilities on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value disclosures are reflected in a three-level hierarchy, maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: ##TABLE_START  Level 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for an identical asset or liability in an active market. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for a similar asset or liability in an active market or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END Certain of the Companys derivatives are valued using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate observable market parameters, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates, classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. Derivative valuations incorporate credit risk adjustments that are necessary to reflect the probability of default by the counterparty or the Company.

For the year ended December 31, 2014 , no material fair value adjustments or fair value measurements were required for non-financial assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_START  Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2014 , the fair value of the Companys debt obligations was estimated at $16.7 billion , compared to a carrying amount of $15.0 billion . The fair value was based on quoted market prices, Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. The carrying amount for both cash equivalents and notes receivable approximate fair value. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt and derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of these changes. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. The Company documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions, as well as all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items. The Companys derivatives that are designated for hedge accounting consist mainly of interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, foreign currency options, and cross-currency swaps, further explained in the \"Fair Value,\" \"Cash Flow\" and \"Net Investment\" hedge sections. The Company also enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded primarily in Selling, general  administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Since these derivatives are not designated for hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in Nonoperating (income) expense together with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. A portion of the Companys foreign currency options (more fully described in the \"Cash Flow Hedges\" section) are undesignated as hedging instruments as the underlying foreign currency royalties are earned. All derivative instruments designated for hedge accounting are classified as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. All derivatives (including those not designated for hedge accounting) are recognized on the Consolidated balance sheet at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity dates. Changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments are reflected as adjustments to other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") and/or current earnings.  36 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report The following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included on the Consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 : ##TABLE_START  Derivative Assets  Derivative Liabilities In millions Balance Sheet Classification    Balance Sheet Classification   Derivatives designated as hedging instruments         Foreign currency Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $ 80.5  $ 28.3  Accrued payroll and other liabilities  $ (0.2 )  $ (28.8 ) Interest rate Prepaid expenses and other current assets  2.6         Foreign currency Miscellaneous other assets  15.5  2.5  Other long-term liabilities  (34.6 )  (114.7 ) Interest rate Miscellaneous other assets  9.6  24.8  Other long-term liabilities  (7.5 )  (12.0 ) Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments  $ 108.2  $ 55.6    $ (42.3 )  $ (155.5 ) Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments         Equity Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $ 120.6  $ 6.7       Foreign currency Prepaid expenses and other current assets  17.3  9.3  Accrued payroll and other liabilities  $ (7.9 )  $ (23.8 ) Equity Miscellaneous other assets    128.2       Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments  $ 137.9  $ 144.2    $ (7.9 )  $ (23.8 ) Total derivatives  $ 246.1  $ 199.8    $ (50.2 )  $ (179.3 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe following table presents the pretax amounts affecting income and OCI for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively: ##TABLE_START In millions                   Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships  Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivative  Hedged Items in Fair Value Hedging Relationships  Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income on Related Hedged Items                         Interest rate   $ (8.1 )  $ (29.5 )  Fixed-rate debt   $ 8.1     $ 29.5                       Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships  Gain (Loss) Recognized in Accumulated OCI on Derivative (Effective Portion)  Gain (Loss) Reclassified into Income from Accumulated OCI (Effective Portion)  Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivative (Amount Excluded from Effectiveness Testing and Ineffective Portion)                       Commodity   $   $ (34.1 )              Foreign currency   62.0  (65.5 )   $ 11.0  $ (50.3 )   $ 9.5     $ (6.1 ) Interest rate (1)        (0.5 )  (0.4 )         Total   $ 62.0  $ (99.6 )   $ 10.5  $ (50.7 )   $ 9.5    $ (6.1 )                            Gain (Loss) Recognized in Accumulated OCI (Effective Portion)    Derivatives Not Designated for Hedge Accounting  Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivative Net Investment Hedging Relationships                           Foreign currency denominated debt   $ 954.6  $ (382.8 )       Foreign currency   $ 10.4  $ (30.2 ) Foreign currency derivatives   126.6  (18.4 )       Equity (2)    23.5  21.8 Total   $ 1,081.2  $ (401.2 )       Total   $ 33.9  $ (8.4 ) ##TABLE_ENDGains (losses) recognized in income on derivatives are recorded in Nonoperating (income) expense, net unless otherwise noted. ##TABLE_START (1) The amount of gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated OCI into income is recorded in Interest expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) The amount of gain (loss) recognized in income on the derivatives used to hedge the supplemental benefit plan liabilities is primarily recorded in Selling, general  administrative expenses. ##TABLE_END  McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 37 ##TABLE_START  Fair Value Hedges ##TABLE_END The Company enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure to changes in the fair values of certain liabilities. The Company's fair value hedges convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt by use of interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2014 , $2.6 billion of the Company's outstanding fixed-rate debt was effectively converted. All of the Companys interest rate swaps meet the shortcut method requirements. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying debt. No ineffectiveness has been recorded to net income related to interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the year ended December 31, 2014. ##TABLE_START  Cash Flow Hedges ##TABLE_END The Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. The types of cash flow hedges the Company enters into include interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, foreign currency options and cross currency swaps. The Company periodically uses interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of floating-rate debt, including forecasted debt issuances, into fixed-rate debt. The agreements are intended to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies), the Company uses foreign currency forwards and foreign currency options to hedge a portion of anticipated exposures. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the decline in value of future foreign denominated royalties is offset by gains in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards and/or foreign currency options. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in the value of future foreign denominated royalties is offset by losses in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards and/or foreign currency options. Although the fair value changes in the foreign currency options may fluctuate over the period of the contract, the Companys total loss on a foreign currency option is limited to the upfront premium paid for the contract; however, the potential gains on a foreign currency option are unlimited. In some situations, the Company uses foreign currency collars, which limit the potential gains and lower the upfront premium paid, to protect against currency movements. The hedges cover the next 18 months for certain exposures and are denominated in various currencies. As of December 31, 2014 , the Company had derivatives outstanding with an equivalent notional amount of $391.1 million that were used to hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency denominated royalties. The Company excludes the time value of foreign currency options from its effectiveness assessment on its cash flow hedges. As a result, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to this component, as well as the ineffectiveness of the hedges, are recognized in earnings currently. The effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is reported in the cash flow hedging component of OCI in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the risk of cash flows associated with certain foreign currency denominated debt, including forecasted interest payments, and has elected cash flow hedge accounting. The hedges cover periods up to 27 months and have an equivalent notional amount of $145.1 million . The Company recorded after tax adjustments to the cash flow hedging component of accumulated OCI in shareholders equity. The Company recorded a net increase of $33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and a net decrease of $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . Based on interest rates and foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2014 , the $31.0 million in cumulative cash flow hedging gains , after tax, at December 31, 2014 , is not expected to have a significant effect on earnings over the next 12 months. ##TABLE_START  Net Investment Hedges ##TABLE_END The Company primarily uses foreign currency denominated debt (third party and intercompany) to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders equity in the foreign currency translation component of OCI and offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in OCI. As of December 31, 2014 , $4.6 billion of the Companys third party foreign currency denominated debt, $3.8 billion of intercompany foreign currency denominated debt, and $835.7 million of derivatives were designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. ##TABLE_START  Credit Risk ##TABLE_END The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its hedging instruments. The counterparties to these agreements consist of a diverse group of financial institutions and market participants. The Company continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and adjusts positions as appropriate. The Company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2014 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. For financial reporting purposes, the Company presents gross derivative balances in the financial statements and supplementary data, even for counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2014 , neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where its counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions. INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES The Company, like other multi-national companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. Accordingly, tax liabilities are recorded when, in managements judgment, a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may still be recorded depending on managements assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled. The Company records interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. 38 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION Diluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of shares): 2014  5.8 ; 2013  7.6 ; 2012  10.1 . Stock options that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutive were (in millions of shares): 2014  5.3 ; 2013  4.7 ; 2012  4.7 . The Company has elected to exclude the pro forma deferred tax asset associated with share-based compensation in earnings per share. STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS The Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").

The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonalds share of results. For foreign affiliated marketsprimarily Japanresults are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonalds share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets are reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. ##TABLE_START  Asset dispositions and other expense ##TABLE_END Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for restaurant closings and uncollectible receivables, asset write-offs due to restaurant reinvestment, and other miscellaneous income and expenses. ##TABLE_START Contingencies  ##TABLE_ENDIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.  McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 39 ##TABLE_START Franchise Arrangements  ##TABLE_ENDConventional franchise arrangements generally include a lease and a license and provide for payment of initial fees, as well as continuing rent and royalties to the Company based upon a percent of sales with minimum rent payments that parallel the Companys underlying leases and escalations (on properties that are leased). Under this arrangement, franchisees are granted the right to operate a restaurant using the McDonalds System and, in most cases, the use of a restaurant facility, generally for a period of 20 years . These franchisees pay related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. Affiliates and developmental licensees operating under license agreements pay a royalty to the Company based upon a percent of sales, and may pay initial fees.

Lease terms for most restaurants, where market conditions allow, are generally for 20 years and, in many cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options, with certain leases providing purchase options. Escalation terms vary by market with examples including fixed-rent escalations, escalations based on an inflation index, and fair-value market adjustments. The timing of these escalations generally ranges from annually to every five years. For most locations, the Company is obligated for the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance; however, for franchised sites, the Company requires the franchisees to pay these costs. In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-cancelable leases covering certain offices and vehicles.

The remainder will expire at various dates from 2015 to 2031. The Company's effective income tax rate is typically lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because non-U.S. income is generally subject to local statutory country tax rates that are below the 35% U.S. statutory tax rate and reflect the impact of global transfer pricing. For 2014, the effective income tax rate is higher than in 2013 primarily due to changes in tax reserves related to certain foreign tax matters. The statutory U.S. federal income tax rate reconciles to the effective income tax rates as follows: ##TABLE_START    Statutory U.S. federal income tax rate 35.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % State income taxes, net of related federal income tax benefit 1.6  1.3  1.6 Foreign income taxed at different rates (4.8 )  (5.1 )  (4.9 ) Taxes related to unfavorable lower tax court ruling and audit progression in foreign tax jurisdictions 4.1     Other, net (0.4 )  0.7  0.7 Effective income tax rates 35.5 %  31.9 %  32.4 % ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Companys gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $988.1 million and $512.7 million , respectively. After considering the deferred tax accounting impact, it is expected that about $580 million of the total as of December 31, 2014 would favorably affect the effective tax rate if resolved in the Companys favor. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START In millions  Balance at January 1 $ 512.7  $ 482.4 Decreases for positions taken in prior years (19.5 )  (38.3 ) Increases for positions taken in prior years 504.7  29.4 Increases for positions related to the current year 80.7  53.8 Settlements with taxing authorities (78.0 )  (2.4 ) Lapsing of statutes of limitations (12.5 )  (12.2 ) Balance at December 31 (1) $ 988.1  $ 512.7 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Of this amount, $909.0 million and $495.1 million are included in Other long-term liabilities for 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and $19.5 million and $16.8 million are included in Current liabilities - income taxes for 2014 and 2013, respectively, on the Consolidated balance sheet. The remainder is included in Deferred income taxes on the Consolidated balance sheet. ##TABLE_END In 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") concluded its field examination of the Company's 2009 and 2010 U.S. federal income tax returns. In connection with this examination, the Company agreed to certain adjustments that have been proposed by the IRS and appropriately accounted for these adjustments in accordance with ASC 740. Also in connection with this examination, the Company received notices of proposed adjustments (\"NOPAs\") related to certain transfer pricing matters. The Company disagrees with the IRS' proposed adjustments and will file a protest with the IRS Appeals Office in 2015. The Company is also under audit in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions for matters primarily related to transfer pricing and exempt income. In addition, the Company is under audit in multiple state tax jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next 12 months by $120 million to $390 million , of which $10 million to $60 million could favorably affect the effective tax rate. This would be due to the expected settlement of the 2009 and 2010 IRS agreed-upon adjustments, the possible settlement of the 2009 and 2010 IRS protest, completion of the aforementioned foreign and state tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions. In addition, it is reasonably possible that, as a result of audit progression in both the U.S. and foreign tax audits within the next 12 months, there may be new information that causes the Company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax  McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 41 benefits recorded. While the Company cannot estimate the impact that new information may have on our unrecognized tax benefit balance, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined under ASC 740. The Company operates within multiple tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. For U.S. federal and major state tax jurisdictions, the Company is generally no longer subject to income tax examinations for years prior to 2009. With respect to major foreign tax jurisdictions, with limited exceptions, the Company and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years prior to 2007. The Company had $119.0 million and $55.4 million accrued for interest and penalties at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalties related to tax matters of $87.9 million in 2014 , $14.4 million in 2013 , and $11.2 million in 2012 , which are included in the provision for income taxes. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. These temporary differences were approximately $15.4 billion at December 31, 2014 and consisted primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. Determination of the deferred income tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.  ##TABLE_START Employee Benefit Plans  ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys Profit Sharing and Savings Plan for U.S.-based employees includes a 401(k) feature, a regular employer match, and a discretionary employer match. The 401(k) feature allows participants to make pretax contributions that are matched each pay period from shares released under the ESOP. The Profit Sharing and Savings Plan also provides for a discretionary employer match after the end of the year for those participants eligible to share in the match. All current account balances, future contributions and related earnings can be invested in several investment alternatives as well as McDonalds common stock in accordance with each participants elections. Participants future contributions to the 401(k) feature are limited to 20% investment in McDonalds common stock. Participants may choose to make separate investment choices for current account balances and for future contributions. The Company also maintains certain nonqualified supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan because of IRS limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities were $534.0 million at December 31, 2014 , and $531.1 million at December 31, 2013 , and were primarily included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheet. The Company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of the liabilities. At December 31, 2014 , derivatives with a fair value of $115.9 million indexed to the Company's stock and a total return swap with a notional amount of $206.3 million indexed to certain market indices were included at their fair value in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated balance sheet. Changes in liabilities for these nonqualified plans and in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded primarily in Selling, general  administrative expenses. Changes in fair value of the derivatives indexed to the Companys stock are recorded in the income statement because the contracts provide the counterparty with a choice to settle in cash or shares.

Fees and interest rates on this line are based on the Companys long-term credit rating assigned by Moodys and Standard  Poors . In addition, the Company's subsidiaries had unused lines of credit that were primarily uncommitted, short-term and denominated in various currencies at local market rates of interest . The weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings was 4.1% at December 31, 2014 (based on $862.9 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings and $200.0 million of commercial paper) and 5.1% at December 31, 2013 (based on $609.7 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings). DEBT OBLIGATIONS The Company has incurred debt obligations principally through public and private offerings and bank loans. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions, and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. Under certain agreements, the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at par or at a premium over par. The Company has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt prior to maturity. ESOP LOANS Borrowings related to the leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") at December 31, 2014 , which include $16.0 million of loans from the Company to the ESOP, are reflected as debt with a corresponding reduction of shareholders equity (additional paid-in capital included a balance of $13.7 million and $19.9 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively). The ESOP is repaying the loans and interest through 2018 using Company contributions and dividends from its McDonalds common stock holdings . As the principal amount of the borrowings is repaid, the debt and the unearned ESOP compensation (additional paid-in capital) are reduced.

The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plans was 67.6 million at December 31, 2014 , including 42.0 million available for future grants. STOCK OPTIONS Stock options to purchase common stock are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Companys stock on the date of grant. Substantially all of the options become exercisable in four equal installments, beginning a year from the date of the grant, and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. Intrinsic value for stock options is defined as the difference between the current market value of the Companys stock and the exercise price. During 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $258.9 million , $325.2 million and $469.8 million , respectively. Cash received from stock options exercised during 2014 was $235.4 million and the tax benefit realized from stock options exercised totaled $80.8 million . The Company uses treasury shares purchased under the Companys share repurchase program to satisfy share-based exercises. A summary of the status of the Companys stock option grants as of December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , and changes during the years then ended, is presented in the following table: ##TABLE_START       Options Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price   Weighted- average remaining contractual life in years  Aggregate intrinsic value in millions   Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price   Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price  Outstanding at beginning of year 25.1   $ 69.15       27.4   $ 59.86  31.7   $ 47.77 Granted 3.9   95.13       3.7   94.36  4.9   99.63 Exercised (5.1 )   46.09       (5.7 )   40.12  (8.6 )   38.51 Forfeited/expired (0.5 )   94.56       (0.3 )   79.15  (0.6 )   55.28 Outstanding at end of year 23.4   $ 77.99  6.1   $ 403.6  25.1   $ 69.15  27.4   $ 59.86 Exercisable at end of year 14.4   $ 67.76  4.8   $ 389.9  15.6     17.1    ##TABLE_ENDRSUs RSUs generally vest 100% on the third anniversary of the grant and are payable in either shares of McDonalds common stock or cash, at the Companys discretion.

The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: ##TABLE_START I. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START II. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START III. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ##TABLE_END There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may vary over time. Management assessed the design and effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on managements assessment using those criteria, as of December 31, 2014 , management believes that the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. Ernst  Young, LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 and the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 . Their reports are presented on the following pages. The independent registered public accountants and internal auditors advise management of the results of their audits, and make recommendations to improve the system of internal controls. Management evaluates the audit recommendations and takes appropriate action. McDONALDS CORPORATION February 24, 2015 46 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report ##TABLE_START Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  ##TABLE_ENDThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonalds Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McDonalds Corporation as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of McDonalds Corporation at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), McDonalds Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 24, 2015 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

McDonalds Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report on Managements Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, McDonalds Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of McDonalds Corporation as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 , and our report dated February 24, 2015 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Business  ##TABLE_ENDMcDonalds Corporation, the registrant, together with its sub-sidiaries, is referred to herein as the Company. a. General Through June 30, 2015, the Company was managed as distinct geographic segments, comprised of the U.S., Europe, Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (\"APMEA\") and Other Countries  Corporate, which included Canada and Latin America. Beginning July 1, 2015, McDonalds started operating under a new organizational structure that combines markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth. Information about the Company's new segments is provided in the Overview section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7, page 13 of this Form 10-K. b. Financial information about segments Segment data for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 are included in Part II, Item 8, page 44 of this Form 10-K. c. Narrative description of business ##TABLE_START  General ##TABLE_END The Company operates and franchises McDonalds restaurants, which serve a locally-relevant menu of quality food and drinks sold at various price points in more than 100 countries. McDonalds global system is comprised of both Company-owned and franchised restaurants. McDonalds franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures - conventional franchise, developmental license or affiliate. The optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant, trading area or market (country) is based on a variety of factors, including the availability of individuals with the entrepreneurial experience and financial resources, as well as the local legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property ownership and franchising. We continually review our mix of Company-owned and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be 95% franchised over the long term. The business relationship between McDonalds and its independent franchisees is of fundamental importance to overall performance and to the McDonalds Brand. This business relationship is supported by an agreement that requires adherence to standards and policies essential to protecting our brand. The Company is primarily a franchisor, with more than 80% of McDonald's restaurants owned and operated by independent franchisees. Franchising enables an individual to own a restaurant business and maintain control over staffing, purchasing, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of McDonalds global brand, operating system and financial resources. One of the strengths of this model is that the expertise gained from operating Company-owned restaurants allows McDonalds to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and, when viable, efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants. Directly operating McDonalds restaurants contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor. Having Company-owned restaurants provides Company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience. In addition, in our Company-owned and operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we are able to further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit relevant McDonalds restaurants. Under a conventional franchise arrangement, the Company owns the land and building or secures a long-term lease for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment, signs, seating and dcor. The Company believes that ownership of real estate, combined with the co-investment by franchisees, enables us to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. Franchisees are also responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time. In addition, to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives, the Company frequently co-invests with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or their operating systems. These investments, developed with input from McDonalds with the aim of improving local business performance, increase the value of our Brand through the development of modernized, more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants. The Companys typical franchise term is 20 years. The Company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors. The business relationship with franchisees is designed to assure consistency and high quality at all McDonalds restaurants. Conventional franchisees contribute to the Companys revenue through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees paid upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new franchise. This structure enables McDonalds to generate significant levels of cash flow. Under a developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest. The Company does not invest any capital under a developmental license arrangement. The Company receives a royalty based upon a percent of sales as well as initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license. We use the developmental license ownership structure in over 70 countries with a total of approximately 5,500 restaurants. The largest developmental licensee operates approximately 2,100 restaurants in 19 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Finally, the Company also has an equity investment in a limited number of foreign affiliated markets, referred to as affiliates. In these markets, the Company receives a royalty based on a percent of sales and records its share of net results in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. The largest of these affiliates is Japan, where there are nearly 3,000 restaurants. ##TABLE_START  Supply Chain and Quality Assurance ##TABLE_END The Company and its franchisees purchase food, packaging, equipment and other goods from numerous independent suppliers. The Company has established and enforces high quality standards and product specifications. The Company has quality centers around the world designed to ensure that its high standards are consistently met. The quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews, but also on-site supplier visits. A Food Safety Advisory Council, composed of the Companys technical, safety and supply chain specialists, as well as suppliers and outside academia, provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food safety. In addition, the Company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation, assure best practices and drive continuous improvement. Leveraging scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies, the Company also collaborates with suppliers toward a goal of achieving competitive, predictable food and paper costs over the long term. Independently owned and operated distribution centers, approved by the Company, distribute products and supplies to McDonalds restaurants. In addition, restaurant personnel are trained in the proper storage, handling and preparation of products.  McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 1 ##TABLE_START  Products ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu, although there are geographic variations to suit local consumer preferences and tastes. In addition, McDonalds tests new products on an ongoing basis. McDonalds menu includes hamburgers and cheeseburgers, Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Filet-O-Fish, several chicken sandwiches, Chicken McNuggets, wraps, french fries, salads, oatmeal, shakes, McFlurry desserts, sundaes, soft serve cones, pies, soft drinks, coffee, McCaf beverages and other beverages. In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of other products during limited-time promotions. McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. and many international markets offer a full or limited breakfast menu. Breakfast offerings may include Egg McMuffin, Sausage McMuffin with Egg, McGriddles, biscuit and bagel sandwiches and hotcakes. Quality, choice and nutrition are increasingly important to our customers and we are continuously evolving our menu to meet our customers' needs. ##TABLE_START  Marketing ##TABLE_END McDonalds global brand is well known. Marketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed to promote McDonalds brand and differentiate the Company from competitors. Marketing and promotional efforts focus on value, quality, food taste, menu choice, nutrition, convenience and the customer experience. ##TABLE_START  Intellectual property ##TABLE_END The Company owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information. The Company considers the trademarks McDonalds and The Golden Arches Logo to be of material importance to its business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. Patents, copyrights and licenses are of varying durations. ##TABLE_START  Seasonal operations ##TABLE_END The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree. ##TABLE_START  Working capital practices ##TABLE_END Information about the Companys working capital practices is incorporated herein by reference to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 in Part II, Item 7, pages 13 through 28, and the Consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 in Part II, Item 8, page 33 of this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START  Customers ##TABLE_END The Companys business is not dependent upon either a single customer or small group of customers. ##TABLE_START  Backlog ##TABLE_END Company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders. ##TABLE_START  Government contracts ##TABLE_END No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at government election. ##TABLE_START  Competition ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of food products. The Company competes on the basis of price, convenience, service, menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry. In measuring the Companys competitive position, management reviews data compiled by Euromonitor International, a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry. The Companys primary competition, which is referred to as the informal eating out (\"IEO\") segment, includes the following restaurant categories defined by Euromonitor International: quick-service eating establishments, casual dining full-service restaurants, street stalls or kiosks, cafs,100% home delivery/takeaway providers, specialist coffee shops, self-service cafeterias and juice/smoothie bars. The IEO segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and full-service restaurants other than casual dining. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the global IEO segment was composed of approximately 8 million outlets and generated $1.2 trillion in annual sales in 2014 , the most recent year for which data is available. McDonalds Systemwide 2014 restaurant business accounted for 0.5% of those outlets and 7.2% of the sales. Management also on occasion benchmarks McDonalds against the entire restaurant industry, including the IEO segment defined above and all other full-service restaurants. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 17 million outlets and generated $2.4 trillion in annual sales in 2014 . McDonalds Systemwide restaurant business accounted for 0.2% of those outlets and 3.6% of the sales. ##TABLE_START  Research and development ##TABLE_END The Company operates research and development facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. While research and development activities are important to the Companys business, these expenditures are not material. Independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the \"System\"). ##TABLE_START  Environmental matters ##TABLE_END The Company continuously endeavors to improve its social responsibility and environmental practices to achieve long-term sustainability, which benefits McDonalds and the communities it serves. Increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives, particularly in the area of climate change. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. Although the impact would likely vary by world region and/or market, we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs for the Company. Also, there is a possibility that governmental initiatives, or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns, climate, or water resources could have a direct impact on the operations of the System in ways which we cannot predict at this time. The Company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner. At this time, the Company has already begun to undertake its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment, including the implementation of more energy efficient equipment and management of energy use and more sustainable sourcing practices in many of its markets. 2 McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report ##TABLE_START  Number of employees ##TABLE_END The Companys number of employees worldwide, including Company-operated restaurant employees, was approximately 420,000 as of year-end 2015 . d.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  ##TABLE_END The information in this report includes forward-looking statements about future events and circumstances and their effects upon revenues, expenses and business opportunities. Generally speaking, any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by the use of forward-looking words, such as may, will, expect, believe and plan or similar expressions. In particular, statements regarding our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry are forward-looking statements. They reflect our expectations, are not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the date of this report. Except as required by law, we do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements. Our business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are reflected in the following considerations and factors, as well as elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. If any of these considerations or risks materialize, our expectations may change and our performance may be adversely affected. If we do not successfully design and execute our business strategies, we may not be able to increase revenues or market share. To drive future results, our business strategies must be effective in achieving market share gains while at the same time delivering operating income growth. Whether we successfully execute these strategies depends mainly on our Systems ability to: ##TABLE_START  Continue to innovate and differentiate in all aspects of the McDonalds experience in a way that balances value to our customers with profitability; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Reinvest in our restaurants and identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our Systems plans for net growth of System-wide restaurants; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Provide clean and friendly environments that deliver a consistent McDonald's experience and demonstrate high service levels; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Drive restaurant improvements that achieve optimal capacity, particularly during peak mealtime hours; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Manage the complexity of our restaurant operations. ##TABLE_END If we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. The implementation of our turnaround plan may intensify the risks we face and may not be successful in driving improved performance. Our turnaround plan includes restructuring market segments, optimizing restaurant ownership mix through accelerated refranchising, delivering cost savings and enhancing financial value through increased leverage. Implementing those actions will intensify the existing risks we face in our business, including risks associated with franchising and risks associated with our credit ratings. Further, if those actions are not successful, take longer to complete than initially projected, or are not executed effectively, our business operations, financial results and results of operations could be adversely affected. We face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business. We compete primarily in the informal eating out (IEO) segment, which is highly competitive. We are facing sustained, intense competition from both traditional and other competitors, which include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores and coffee shops. In addition, in recent periods we have experienced emerging and growing competition from the fast casual category of restaurants. We expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive and in any particular reporting period our results may be impacted by new actions of our competitors, which may have a short- or long-term impact on our results. We compete on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. In particular, we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, develop new products, price our products appropriately, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations and respond effectively to our  McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 3 competitors actions. Recognizing these dependencies, we have intensified our focus in recent periods on strategies to achieve these goals, including the turnaround plan described above, and we will likely continue to modify our strategies and implement new strategies in the future. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics. If we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences, our business could suffer. Our continued success depends on our Systems ability to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics, trends in food sourcing, food preparation and consumer preferences in the IEO segment. We must continuously adapt to deliver a relevant experience for our customers amidst a highly competitive, value-driven operating environment. We continue to implement initiatives to address these shifts at an aggressive pace. There is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful and, if they are not, our financial results could be adversely impacted. If our pricing, promotional and marketing plans are not effective, our results may be negatively impacted. Our results depend on the impact of our pricing, promotional and marketing plans and our Systems ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly to economic and competitive conditions. Our existing or future pricing strategies and the value proposition they represent will continue to be important components of our overall plan, may not be successful and could negatively impact sales and margins. The promotion of our menu offerings may yield results below desired levels. Additionally, we operate in an increasingly complex and costly advertising environment. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful and we may fail to attract and retain customers. We have increased our emphasis on digital offerings and customer loyalty initiatives, and our success depends in part on whether we can effectively execute such offerings and initiatives in a way that will enhance customer engagement. If our pricing, promotional and marketing plans are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease. Failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have a negative impact on our financial results. To be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brand. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, our business practices and the manner in which we source the commodities we use. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons. For example, nutritional, health and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and often have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the IEO segment or perceptions of our brand and could be material to our business. Perceptions may also be affected by third parties presenting or promoting adverse commentary or perceptions of the quick-service category of the IEO segment, our brand and/or our operations, our suppliers or our franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing such adverse commentary or perceptions, our brand and our financial results may suffer. Additionally, the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our sustainability initiatives to support our brand ambition of good food, good people and good neighbor, which will require System-wide coordination and alignment. If we are not effective in achieving our stated sustainability goals and addressing these and other matters of social responsibility in a way that inspires trust and confidence, trust in our brand could suffer. In particular, business incidents that erode consumer trust, particularly if such incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results. Unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions, which can vary significantly by market and can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits. Economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including hostilities, epidemics and actions taken by governments to manage national economic matters, whether through austerity or stimulus measures and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers. Many major economies, both advanced and developing, continue to face weak economies, high unemployment rates and other ongoing economic issues. Continued adverse economic conditions or adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could pressure our operating performance, and our business and financial results may suffer. Supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues. We depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient product supply, including on favorable terms. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world. Supply chain interruptions, including due to lack of supply or price increases, can adversely affect us or the suppliers and franchisees that are also part of our System and whose performance has a significant impact on our results. Such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers or us, including inclement weather, natural disasters, increased demand, problems in production or distribution, disruptions in third party logistics or transportation systems, the inability of our suppliers to obtain credit, or food safety warnings or advisories. If we experience interruptions in our supply chain, our costs could increase and it could limit the availability of products critical to our operations. Food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business. Our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our Systems ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonalds of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future. Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe food products. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. In 2014, food quality issues were discovered at a supplier to McDonalds and other food companies in China. As a consequence of this issue, results in China, Japan and certain other markets were negatively impacted due to lost sales and profitability, including expenses associated with rebuilding customer trust. Any future instances of food tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our brand and reputation as well as our revenues and profits. Our franchise business model presents a number of risks. Our success relies in part on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, yet we have limited influence over their operations. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: 4 McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants. Our franchisees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. Our franchisees may not experience sales growth, and our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result. If sales trends worsen for franchisees, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, restaurant closures or delayed or reduced payments to us. Our refranchising effort will increase that dependence and the effect of those factors. Our success also depends on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of our franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general or by the creditworthiness of our franchisees or the Company. Our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project a brand image inconsistent with our values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subject to litigation. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, the brands image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results. Our ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing. Our ability to achieve the benefits of our refranchising strategy, which involves a shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants, in a timely manner or at all, will depend on various factors, including our ability to timely and effectively identify franchisees that meet our rigorous standards, the performance of our existing franchisees, whether the resulting ownership mix supports our financial objectives and our ability to manage risks associated with our refranchising strategy. Changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations. The profitability of our company-operated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, including food, paper, supply, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs. Any volatility in certain commodity prices could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability. The commodity market for some of the ingredients we use, such as beef and chicken, is particularly volatile and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, international commodity markets, food safety concerns, product recalls, government regulation and other factors, all of which are beyond our control and, in many instances, unpredictable. We can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities, and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability. The global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business. We face differing cultural, regulatory and economic environments that exist within and among the more than 100 countries where McDonalds restaurants operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on our success in these environments. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our Systems ability to leverage operating successes across markets. Our initiatives may not have broad appeal with our customer base and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts. Disruptions in our operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or import-export controls, increased tariffs, government-mandated closure of our or our suppliers operations and asset seizures. The cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or actions, whether or not they have merit, may impact our results. Our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brand-building initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental actions. Our results of operations and financial condition are also affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect reported earnings. Additionally, we face challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. Such challenges are exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our international operations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Challenges with respect to talent management could harm our business. Our success depends in part on our Systems ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel to work in our restaurants. Increased costs associated with recruiting and retaining such qualified personnel, whether because of the trend toward higher statutory minimum wages and social expenses or because of voluntary increases in wages necessitated by labor market conditions, could have a negative impact on the margins of our company-operated restaurants. Additionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect (including the ability to recruit and retain talent) us or the franchisees and suppliers that are also part of the McDonalds System and whose performance may have a material impact on our results. We are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and international regulations affecting our workforce, which includes our staff and employees working in our company-operated restaurants. These regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues including wage and hour, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and unlawful workplace discrimination. Our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers (or perceptions thereof) could have a negative impact on our business. Information technology system failures or interruptions or breaches of network security may interrupt our operations. We are increasingly reliant on technological systems (e.g., point-of-sale and other in-store systems or platforms) to conduct our business, including technology-enabled solutions provided to us by third parties; and any failure of these systems could significantly impact our operations and customer perceptions. Despite the implementation of security measures, those technology systems and solutions could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. The third  McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 5 party solutions also present the risks faced by the third partys business. If those systems or solutions were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we could experience an interruption in our operations. We may also not fully realize the benefits of the significant investments we are making to enhance the customer experience through digital engagement and social media. Furthermore, security breaches involving our systems or those of third party providers may occur, such as unauthorized access, denial of service, computer viruses and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Our information technology systems contain personal, financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. An actual or alleged security breach could result in system disruptions, shutdowns, theft or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. The occurrence of any of these incidents could result in adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, and criminal penalties or civil liabilities. Increasing regulatory complexity may adversely affect restaurant operations and our financial results. Our regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and countries in Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. We are affected by the cost, compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face, including where inconsistent standards imposed by multiple governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings. Our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of new, potential or changing regulations that can affect our business plans. These regulations may relate to, among others, product packaging, marketing and the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices, ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants, and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers (particularly given varying requirements and practices for testing and disclosure). Additionally, we are keenly aware of and working to manage the risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, energy and water resources. The increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters (e.g., packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use) and the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them, could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us. Increasing legal complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. We could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, employment and personal injury claims, landlord/tenant disputes, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former franchisees, and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another partys trademarks, copyrights, or patents). Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation. Litigation involving our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law purposes, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. Similarly, although our commercial relationships with our suppliers remain independent, there may be attempts to challenge that independence, which, if determined adversely, could also increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our suppliers, and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. We are also subject to the legal and compliance risks associated with privacy, data collection, protection and management, in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide optional technology-related services to franchisees. Our operating results could also be affected by the following: ##TABLE_START  The relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The cost and other effects of settlements, judgments or consent decrees, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The scope and terms of insurance or indemnification protections that we may have. ##TABLE_END A judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt our business. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the McDonalds brand and our business. The success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products. We also license our intellectual property to franchisees and other third parties and we cannot assure you that they will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property. We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the United States in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. In particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be 6 McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report time-consuming, could result in costly litigation and could harm our business. Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world. In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations, particularly if corporate tax reform becomes a key component of budgetary initiatives in the United States and elsewhere. We are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the IRS or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. Any increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Changes in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future operations and results. New accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results. We may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings. In assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. If we experience any such changes, they could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods. A decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability. We may be negatively affected by the impact of changes in our debt levels or our results of operations on our credit ratings, interest expense, availability of acceptable counterparties, ability to obtain funding on favorable terms or our operating or financial flexibility, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants. In particular, our credit rating was lowered as a result of our decision to increase our leverage and the pace of the return of cash to our shareholders. Our operations may also be impacted by regulations affecting capital flows, financial markets or financial institutions, which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs. If any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Trading volatility and price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors. Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these factors, some of which are outside our control, are the following: ##TABLE_START  The continuing unpredictable global economic and market conditions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the United States which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can be affected by market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete); unauthorized disclosures about our performance, plans or expectations about our business; our actual performance and creditworthiness; investor confidence generally; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonalds may be included, such as the SP 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of our stock repurchase program or dividend rate; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact on our results of corporate actions and market and third-party perceptions and assessments of such actions, such as those we may take from time to time as we review our corporate structure and strategies in light of business, legal and tax considerations. ##TABLE_END Our results and prospects can be adversely affected by events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others. Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels or other factors that affect our results and prospects, such as commodity costs. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

The Company identifies and develops sites that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential to the Company. To assess potential, the Company analyzes traffic and walking patterns, census data and other relevant data. The Companys experience and access to advanced technology aid in evaluating this information. The Company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for conventional franchised and Company-operated restaurant sites, which ensures long-term occupancy rights and helps control related costs. Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to control average development costs through construction and design efficiencies, standardization and by leveraging the Companys global sourcing network.

In addition, the Company is subject to various national and local laws and regulations that impact various aspects of its business, as discussed below. While the Company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, unfavorable rulings could occur. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on net income for the period in which the ruling occurs or for future periods. ##TABLE_START  Franchising ##TABLE_END A substantial number of McDonalds restaurants are franchised to independent owner/operators under contractual arrangements with the Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company and its current or former franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects including, but not limited to, quality, service and cleanliness issues, contentions regarding grants or terminations of franchises, delinquent payments of rents and fees, and franchisee claims for additional franchises or rewrites of franchises. Additionally, occasional disputes arise between the Company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a McDonalds franchise or who challenge the legal distinction between the Company and its franchisees for employment law purposes. ##TABLE_START  Suppliers ##TABLE_END The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries generally do not supply food, paper or related items to any McDonalds restaurants. The Company relies upon numerous independent suppliers, including service providers, that are required to meet and maintain the Companys high standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company and its suppliers (or former suppliers) which include, for example, compliance with product specifications and the Companys business relationship with suppliers. In addition, disputes occasionally arise on a number of issues between the Company and individuals or entities who claim that they should be (or should have been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the Companys restaurants. ##TABLE_START  Employees ##TABLE_END Hundreds of thousands of people are employed by the Company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, thousands of people from time to time seek employment in such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes arise regarding hiring, termination, promotion and pay practices, including wage and hour disputes, alleged discrimination and compliance with labor and employment laws. ##TABLE_START  Customers ##TABLE_END Restaurants owned by subsidiaries of the Company regularly serve a broad segment of the public.

Given the Companys returns on equity, incremental invested capital and assets, management believes it is prudent to reinvest in the business in markets with acceptable returns and/or opportunity for long-term growth and use excess cash flow to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The Company has paid dividends on common stock for 40 consecutive years through 2015 and has increased the dividend amount at least once every year. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors.

McDonald's is included in published restaurant indices; however, unlike most other companies included in these indices, which have no or limited international operations, McDonald's does business in more than 100 countries and a substantial portion of our revenues and income is generated outside the U.S. In addition, because of our size, McDonald's inclusion in those indices tends to skew the results. Therefore, we believe that such a comparison is not meaningful. Our market capitalization, trading volume and importance in an industry that is vital to the U.S. economy have resulted in McDonald's inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) since 1985. Like McDonald's, many DJIA companies generate meaningful revenues and income outside the U.S. and some manage global brands. Thus, we believe that the use of the DJIA companies as the group for comparison purposes is appropriate. The following performance graph shows McDonald's cumulative total shareholder returns (i.e., price appreciation and reinvestment of dividends) relative to the Standard  Poor's 500 Stock Index (SP 500 Index) and to the DJIA companies for the five-year period ended December 31, 2015 . The graph assumes that the value of an investment in McDonald's common stock, the SP 500 Index and the DJIA companies (including McDonald's) was $100 at December 31, 2010 . For the DJIA companies, returns are weighted for market capitalization as of the beginning of each period indicated. These returns may vary from those of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, which is not weighted by market capitalization, and may be composed of different companies during the period under consideration. ##TABLE_START Company/Index Dec '10 Dec '11 Dec '12 Dec '13 Dec '14 Dec '15 McDonald's Corporation 135 139 181 SP 500 Index 102 157 181 Dow Jones Industrials 108 155 171 ##TABLE_ENDSource: SP Capital IQ  McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 11 ##TABLE_START ", "6": " ITEM 6.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  ##TABLE_ENDOverview DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants. Of the 36,525 restaurants in 119 countries at year-end 2015 , 30,081 were franchised (reflects 21,147 franchised to conventional franchisees, 5,529 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,405 licensed to foreign affiliates (\"affiliates\")primarily Japan) and 6,444 were operated by the Company. Under McDonald's conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and dcor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees enabling restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in the reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants in an effort to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives. Under McDonald's developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market. McDonald's is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. Franchising enables an individual to own a restaurant business and maintain control over staffing, purchasing, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the financial strength and global experience of McDonald's. However, directly operating restaurants is important to being a credible franchisor and provides Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, McDonald's further develops and refines operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that the Company believes are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. McDonald's continually reviews its mix of Company-operated and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be 95% franchised over the long term. The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. Through June 30, 2015, the Company was managed as distinct geographic segments, comprised of the U.S., Europe, Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa and Other Countries  Corporate, which included Canada and Latin America. Beginning July 1, 2015, McDonalds started operating under a new organizational structure with the following segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth: ##TABLE_START  U.S. - the Company's largest segment. This segment did not change as a result of the new reporting structure. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  International Lead Markets - established markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the U.K. and related markets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  High Growth Markets - markets believed to have relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential including China, Italy, Korea, Poland, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands and related markets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Foundational Markets  Corporate - the remaining markets in the McDonald's system, each of which is believed to have the potential to operate under a largely franchised model. Corporate activities are also reported within this segment. ##TABLE_END In September 2015, the Company issued segment summary financial information and segment historical data in accordance with its new reporting structure for the previously reported years ended 2010 through 2014 and quarters ended March 31, 2014 through June 30, 2015. The segment information included herein is presented in accordance with the change in reporting structure for all periods presented. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the U.S., International Lead Markets and High Growth Markets segments accounted for 34% , 30% and 24% of total revenues, respectively. In analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, operating income growth and returns. ##TABLE_START  Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases most incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents its underlying business trends. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the Companys initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Typically, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. The goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Companys financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. ##TABLE_END McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 13 ##TABLE_START  Return on incremental invested capital (\"ROIIC\") is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. ##TABLE_END STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the \"System\") has been key to McDonald's long-term success. By leveraging the System, McDonalds is able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. In addition, the Companys business model enables the System to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities it serves. In 2015, the Company and its Board of Directors took steps to reset its business and restore growth, which included the election of a new CEO in the first quarter. In May, management announced the initial steps of the Company's turnaround plan, beginning with a worldwide restructuring in July. This resulted in a reorganization from a geographically-focused structure to segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth. This new operating structure is designed to sharpen the Company's focus on the customer, drive greater accountability, and remove distractions and bureaucracy. Management expects the new structure to enable faster decision-making and an increased ability to move proven initiatives quickly across markets. The System is focused on the fundamentals of running great restaurants by providing customers with what matters most to them - hot and fresh food, fast and friendly service, and a contemporary restaurant experience at the value of McDonalds. In addition, McDonalds is building on its competitive advantages of convenience, scale, geographic diversification and System alignment that have been created over time. McDonalds aspires to be viewed by its customers as a modern and progressive burger company delivering a contemporary customer experience. The priorities of the turnaround plan are threefold: drive operational growth, create brand excitement and enhance financial value. To drive operational growth, the Company is working to enhance the quality, choice and variety of its menu. In addition, the Company is building upon investments it has already made in reimaging and technology to innovate the way customers can order and how they are served, which represent elements of the Experience of the Future. While execution and timing of these elements may be different in each market, Experience of the Future is designed to fundamentally enhance McDonald's relationship with customers and their experience with the brand. The Companys brand efforts aim to reach customers in ways that drive greater excitement and are meaningful to them, such as fun, engaging marketing campaigns and focused support of communities. Enhancements to the quality of McDonald's menu, more local sourcing of ingredients, and commitments around sustainability efforts are all designed to improve consumer confidence in the Brand. The modifications to McDonalds operating approach are accompanied by strategies to enhance financial value. In 2015, management announced plans to optimize the Companys restaurant ownership mix by refranchising about 4,000 restaurants through 2018, deliver net annual GA savings of about $500 million, the vast majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2017, and return about $30 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2016. McDonalds maintains a strong financial foundation supported by industry-leading unit volumes that enable the Company to pursue growth through business and economic cycles while returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders each year. Cash from operations benefits from a heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from franchisees provides a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs and enables co-investment, either through capital expenditures or rent incentives, with franchisees on key initiatives, such as reimaging. In addition, the franchise business model is less capital intensive as franchisees invest in the costs of going into business and most future reinvestment. The Companys substantial cash flow, strong investment grade credit rating and continued access to credit provides McDonalds flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders. After a thorough evaluation of financial opportunities, management announced plans to optimize the Companys capital structure and increased the cash return to shareholders target to about $30 billion for the three-year period ending 2016 - a $10 billion increase over the previous target with incremental debt funding the vast majority of the increase. This proactive move in the Companys leverage metrics and credit ratings still enables McDonalds to efficiently and cost effectively access capital globally, while allowing for continued investment in the business. These actions, together with the decision of the Board of Directors to raise the dividend in 2015, reflect the Board and managements confidence in McDonald's future. The Companys financial results for 2015 reflect two distinct performance periods. During the first half of the year, the Company took bold and urgent action to reset the business and refocus the System on its customers; however, operating performance was weak. The second half of the year was about execution, with results turning positive and providing tangible evidence that the turnaround plan is working. In McDonalds heavily franchised business model, growing comparable sales is important to increasing operating income and returns. Global comparable sales increased 1.5% in 2015, driven by positive performance across all segments in the third and fourth quarters. Consolidated guest counts were negative for the year. U.S. comparable sales increased 0.5% and comparable guest counts declined 3.0%, though performance improved sequentially throughout the year with positive comparable sales in the third and fourth quarters. Comparable sales in the International Lead markets grew 3.4% and comparable guest counts increased 1.0%. All major markets contributed to the positive comparable sales performance except France, which was impacted by macro-economic headwinds. In the High Growth markets, comparable sales increased 1.8% and comparable guest counts declined 2.2%. The increase in comparable sales was driven primarily by solid performance in China as the market successfully executed strong recovery plans following the prior year supplier issue.  Comparable sales in the Foundational markets increased 0.7% and comparable guest counts declined 3.7%. Solid performance in many markets across Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East were offset by negative comparable sales and guest counts in Japan. 14 McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report RESULTS FOR THE YEAR: ##TABLE_START  Global comparable sales increased 1.5%, reflecting an increase in all segments. Comparable guest counts declined 2.3%, as positive guest traffic in the International Lead markets was more than offset by negative guest traffic in all other segments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Systemwide sales, a non-GAAP measure that includes franchised sales, decreased 6% (increased 3% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consolidated revenues decreased 7% (increased 3% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consolidated operating income decreased 10% (flat in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted earnings per share was flat (increased 10% in constant currencies) at $4.80. Results and comparisons were impacted by the following current and prior year items outside normal operations: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Strategic charges, primarily related to goodwill impairment and other asset write-offs in conjunction with the Company's refranchising initiatives, restructuring activities and incremental restaurant closings primarily in China, Japan and the U.S., were partly offset by a gain on sale of property in the U.S. These items had a negative net impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.18 in 2015. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Charges related to certain foreign tax matters and the China supplier issue had a negative impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.54 in 2014. ##TABLE_END Excluding the impact of these current and prior year items, earnings per share in constant currencies would have reflected an increase of $0.12 or 2% in 2015. ##TABLE_START  Cash provided by operations was $6.5 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  One-year ROIIC was 1.5% and three-year ROIIC was negative 3.7% for the period ended December 31, 2015  (see reconciliation on page 28). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 5% to $0.89 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $3.56 per share. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company returned $9.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases for the year. This brings the cumulative return to shareholders to $15.8 billion for the two-year period ending 2015 versus the targeted return of about $30 billion for the three-year period ending 2016. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Capital expenditures of $1.8 billion were split fairly evenly between new restaurant openings and reinvestment in existing restaurants. Across the System, about 1,000 restaurants were opened and over 1,000 existing locations were reimaged. ##TABLE_END AREAS OF FOCUS BY SEGMENT U.S. As the Company's largest segment, the U.S. remains critical to the Company's turnaround given its significant contribution to consolidated results. While results in the first half of 2015 were weak, the steps taken to enhance menu quality, simplify restaurant operations and offer more convenience to customers led to a meaningful shift in momentum starting in the third quarter. Menu initiatives in the U.S. include enhancing the taste of core products through new cooking procedures and continuing to evolve its menu and ingredients, including the introduction of the Artisan Grilled Chicken and Premium Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Deluxe sandwiches. The October launch of All Day Breakfast built on the positive momentum experienced during the third quarter. McDonalds ability to move from one test market in April to a national launch in October in over 13,000 restaurants is a testament to the cultural changes the Company is making to become more relevant to customers. The U.S. is placing a renewed emphasis on running great restaurants. This includes simplifying the menu and operations and making it easier for guests to order and interact with the Brand. Customer feedback systems are showing improvements in many important aspects of the customer visit, including food quality, order accuracy, speed and friendliness. The recent launch of McDonalds mobile app in the U.S. is designed to capture additional demand and engage with customers in more fun, personal and relevant ways. Given the importance of value to its customers, the U.S. is working to establish a consistent national value offering. The goal is to provide customers more choice and flexibility, including the opportunity to bundle their own meals at compelling price points. International Lead Markets The International Lead markets remain relentlessly focused on customers and using data insights to better understand and respond to their changing needs and expectations. These markets are focused on food quality, which includes modernizing cooking and service platforms to serve hotter, fresher food. Local market initiatives include new recipes and quality ingredients, such as a range of new Signature Beef products in the U.K. The International Lead markets are working to improve the restaurant experience with a focus on customizing the menu for individual tastes, and offering customers different ways to order, pay for or receive their food. Markets continue to test solutions like self-order kiosks, table service and curbside delivery that help restaurant teams better connect with and serve customers because they simplify operations. These solutions also enable restaurants to accommodate more customers during busy peak times, thereby driving overall business performance. Markets are at different stages, but all are making steady progress towards enhancing the customer experience. France is the furthest along with digital, web ordering, self-order kiosks and table service in the majority of restaurants. Australia's platform focuses on personalization and customization of premium burgers, chicken sandwiches and salads ordered through self-order kiosks. Canada and the U.K. have a number of Experience of the Future restaurants in place today and have plans to deploy more broadly in 2016. The International Lead markets continue to focus on sustainability and social responsibility to become an even more relevant and trusted brand. High Growth Markets McDonald's High Growth markets are focused on creating customer excitement through menu, promotions and value, and implementing a digital strategy with specific mobile solutions and actions to build the business and brand trust. In addition to driving operational growth in existing restaurants, targeted new restaurant development and refranchising initiatives are top priorities. New restaurant openings totaled over 400 in 2015, while net additions were over 200. Between 400-500 total openings are planned for 2016, primarily in China, with a strong emphasis on freestanding restaurants with drive-thrus. The High Growth markets include about half of the Systems planned global openings for 2016.  McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 15 Foundational Markets The Foundational markets span over 80 countries across Asia, Europe, Latin America, Middle East and Africa. This diverse group of markets share common goals of enhancing the critical elements that differentiate McDonalds - the menu and the customer experience. Menu efforts include emphasizing core favorites and ensuring strong everyday value platforms are in place, complemented by exciting new menu news tailored to local tastes and flavor preferences. The markets are placing a renewed commitment on running great restaurants and increasing convenience to customers, including drive-thru and delivery. The segment is pursuing refranchising opportunities, including the sale of certain markets to developmental licensees. McDonald's is also exploring the sale of a portion of the Companys ownership in McDonalds Japan to a strategic investor who could help advance Japans turnaround efforts, unlock the markets growth potential, and enhance value for all stakeholders. OUTLOOK FOR 2016  As McDonald's continues to execute its turnaround plan in 2016, the Company is confident that these strategies will transform customer perceptions of McDonald's as a modern and progressive burger company delivering a contemporary experience. Although some larger markets face challenging headwinds as the Company enters 2016, McDonald's expects continued positive top-line momentum across all segments. McDonald's System is committed to elevating every aspect of the customer experience with the essential imperative of running great restaurants. While the Company does not provide specific guidance on earnings per share, the following global and certain segment-specific information is provided to assist in forecasting the Companys future results. ##TABLE_START  Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1 percentage point to 2016 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the U.S. or the International Lead Markets segment would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 4 cents. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  With about 75% of McDonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company's commodity costs. For the full-year 2016, costs for the total basket of goods are expected to decrease about 1-2% in the U.S. and remain relatively flat in the International Lead Markets segment. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects full-year 2016 selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease about 1-2% in constant currencies, with fluctuations expected between the quarters. This includes expenses associated with our Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention in second quarter 2016 and sponsorship of the Summer Olympic games in third quarter 2016. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full-year 2016 to increase about 40-45% compared with 2015 due to higher average debt balances. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  A significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 30% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by up to 25 cents. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2016 to be in the 31%-33% range. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate outside of the annual range. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects capital expenditures for 2016 to be approximately $2.0 billion, about half of which will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open about 1,000 restaurants, including about 400 restaurants in affiliated and developmental-licensee markets where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of about 500 restaurants. The remaining capital will be used to reinvest in existing locations, including about 400 to 500 reimages in the U.S. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company plans to optimize its capital structure and expects to return about $30 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2016. The cumulative return for the two years ended 2015 was nearly $16 billion, leaving about $14 billion to be completed in 2016. Some of this remaining amount will be funded by issuing additional debt, of which approximately $6 billion was issued in the fourth quarter 2015. ##TABLE_END Long-term ##TABLE_START  The Company expects to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants in the four-year period ending 2018 with a long-term goal to become 95% franchised. The majority of the refranchising will take place in the High Growth and Foundational markets. During 2015, we refranchised about 470 restaurants. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects to realize net annual GA savings of about $500 million from our GA base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015, the vast majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2017. These savings will be realized through our refranchising efforts, streamlining resources across corporate, segment and market organizations, primarily in non-customer facing functions, and realizing greater efficiencies in the Company's Global Business Services platform. This target excludes the impact of foreign currency changes. We expect to realize a cumulative total of about $150 million in savings by the end of 2016, with about half of these savings already achieved in 2015. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In connection with executing against our refranchising and GA targets, we may incur incremental strategic charges associated with asset dispositions and restructuring. ##TABLE_END 16 McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report Consolidated Operating Results ##TABLE_START Operating results           Dollars and shares in millions, except per share data  Amount  Increase/ (decrease)   Amount  Increase/ (decrease)   Amount Revenues             Sales by Company-operated restaurants  $ 16,488  (9 %)   $ 18,169  (4 %)   $ 18,875 Revenues from franchised restaurants  8,925  (4 )   9,272    9,231 Total revenues  25,413  (7 )   27,441  (2 )   28,106 Operating costs and expenses             Company-operated restaurant expenses  13,977  (9 )   15,288  (2 )   15,579 Franchised restaurants-occupancy expenses  1,647  (3 )   1,697    1,624 Selling, general  administrative expenses  2,434  (2 )   2,488    2,386 Other operating (income) expense, net   n/m    n/m   (247 ) Total operating costs and expenses  18,267 (6 )   19,492    19,342 Operating income  7,146  (10 )   7,949  (9 )   8,764 Interest expense        Nonoperating (income) expense, net  (48 )  n/m    n/m   Income before provision for income taxes  6,556  (11 )   7,372  (10 )   8,204 Provision for income taxes  2,027  (22 )   2,614    2,618 Net income  $ 4,529  (5 %)   $ 4,758  (15 %)   $ 5,586 Earnings per common sharediluted  $ 4.80  %   $ 4.82  (13 %)   $ 5.55 Weighted-average common shares outstanding diluted  944.6  (4 %)   986.3  (2 %)   1,006.0 ##TABLE_ENDn/m Not meaningful IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonalds mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing goods and services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results in each of the last three years. In 2015, results were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, Australian Dollar, Russian Ruble and most other currencies.  In 2014, results were negatively impacted by the weaker Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar and certain other currencies, partly offset by the stronger British Pound. In 2013, results were negatively impacted by the weaker Australian Dollar, Japanese Yen and many other foreign currencies, partly offset by the stronger Euro.

Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.50 on diluted earnings per share. In 2014, net income decreased 15% (13% in constant currencies) to $4.8 billion and diluted earnings per common share decreased 13% (11% in constant currencies) to $4.82. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.12 on diluted earnings per share. Results in 2015 benefited from higher franchised margins and a gain on sale of property in the U.S., partly offset by strategic charges, primarily related to goodwill impairment and other asset write-offs in conjunction with the Company's refranchising initiatives, restructuring and incremental restaurant closings. The strategic charges and gain on sale of property in the U.S. had a negative net impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.18 in 2015. Results in 2014 were negatively impacted by the following items that had a negative impact of $0.54 on diluted earnings per share: ##TABLE_START  $0.31 per share due to an increase in tax reserves for 2003-2010 resulting from an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction, as well as an increase in tax reserves related to audit progression in other foreign tax jurisdictions. ##TABLE_END McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 17 ##TABLE_START  $0.23 per share due to the estimated impact of a supplier issue in China. As a consequence, results in China, Japan and certain other markets were negatively impacted due to lost sales and profitability, including expenses associated with customer recovery efforts. ##TABLE_END Excluding the impact of these current and prior year items, in 2015 earnings per share in constant currencies would have reflected an increase of $0.12 or 2%. In 2014, diluted earnings per share would have reflected a decrease of 3% (1% in constant currencies) excluding the 2014 charges related to certain foreign tax matters and the China supplier issue. This supplemental information is provided to assist investors in understanding the impact of significant items outside of normal operations. The Company repurchased 61.8 million shares of its stock for $6.2 billion in 2015 and 33.1 million shares of its stock for $3.2 billion in 2014 , driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share. ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_ENDREVENUES The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company is accelerating the pace of refranchising to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams, and operate with a less resource-intensive structure. The shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales are replaced by franchised sales, where the Company receives rent and/or royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales. In 2015 , constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales and the benefit from expansion. In 2014, constant currency revenue was flat compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of negative comparable sales, partially offset by expansion. ##TABLE_START Revenues   Amount   Increase/(decrease)   Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation  Dollars in millions        Company-operated sales:               U.S.  $ 4,198  $ 4,351  $ 4,512  (4 %)  (4 %)  (4 %)  (4 %) International Lead Markets  4,798  5,443  5,513  (12 )  (1 )   (1 ) High Growth Markets  5,442  6,071  6,322  (10 )  (4 )   Foundational Markets  Corporate  2,050  2,304  2,528  (11 )  (9 )   (3 ) Total  $ 16,488  $ 18,169  $ 18,875  (9 %)  (4 %)  %  (1 %) Franchised revenues:               U.S.  $ 4,361  $ 4,300  $ 4,339  %  (1 %)  %  (1 %) International Lead Markets  2,817  3,101  3,023  (9 )    High Growth Markets     (5 )    Foundational Markets  Corporate  1,016  1,097  1,148  (7 )  (4 )   Total  $ 8,925  $ 9,272  $ 9,231  (4 %)  %  %  % Total revenues:               U.S.  $ 8,559  $ 8,651  $ 8,851  (1 %)  (2 %)  (1 %)  (2 %) International Lead Markets  7,615  8,544  8,536  (11 )    High Growth Markets  6,173  6,845  7,043  (10 )  (3 )   Foundational Markets  Corporate  3,066  3,401  3,676  (10 )  (7 )   (1 ) Total  $ 25,413  $ 27,441  $ 28,106  (7 %)  (2 %)  %  %                ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  US: In 2015, the decrease in revenues reflected the impact from refranchising.

Franchised margin dollars represented about 70% of the combined restaurant margins in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . In 2015, franchised margin dollars decreased  $297 million or 4% (increased 4% in constant currencies). The constant currency increase was due to positive comparable sales performance, expansion and refranchising. In 2014, franchised margin dollars decreased $32 million or 0% (increased 1% in constant currencies), reflecting a benefit from expansion and refranchising, offset by negative comparable sales performance. In connection with the Company's long-term financial targets, the Company plans to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants for the four-year period ending 2018. While this refranchising activity may have a dilutive effect on the franchised margin percent, it typically results in higher franchised margin dollars.

COMPANY-OPERATED MARGINS Company-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. In 2 015,  Company-operated margin dollars decreased $ 370 million or 13% ( 1% in constant currencies).

This was partly offset by the benefit from recovery in China from the 2014 supplier issue. In 2014, the decrease was primarily due to the negative impact of the supplier issue in China and weaker results in Russia. ##TABLE_END20 McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report SELLING, GENERAL  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses decreased  2% (increased 4% in constant currencies) in 2015 and increased 4% (5% in constant currencies) in 2014. The constant currency increase in 2015 was due to higher incentive-based compensation costs reflecting improved performance, partly offset by lower employee-related costs resulting from the Company's recent restructuring initiatives. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to higher employee and other costs, the 2014 Winter Olympics and the Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention, partly offset by a reduction in incentive-based compensation.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales was 2.9% in 2015 , 2.8% in 2014 and 2.7% in 2013 . Management believes that analyzing selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales, as well as revenues, is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall McDonald's business. As a result of the re-categorization of all markets from the prior geographic segments into the new segments, historical market support expenses outside the U.S. were reallocated from the prior geographic segments into the new international segments for all periods presented. Beginning July 1, 2015, the Company centralized certain market support expenses previously incurred by the geographic segments into Corporate. As a result, these expenses were included in the segment results prior to July 1, 2015 and in Corporate results subsequent to that date.

In addition, 2015 results were negatively impacted by restructuring and restaurant closing charges. In 2014, the decrease in results was due to lower restaurant margin dollars, lower other operating income and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  International Lead Markets: In 2015, the constant currency operating income increase was due primarily to higher franchised margin dollars, benefiting from positive comparable sales performance. In 2014, the constant currency increase was due primarily to higher franchised margin dollars, partly offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  High Growth Markets: In 2015, the constant currency operating income increase reflected recovery from the 2014 supplier issue in China and higher franchised margin dollars, partly offset by restaurant closing charges. In 2014, the decrease reflected the negative impact of the supplier issue and lower Company-operated margin dollars in Russia. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Foundational Markets and Corporate: In 2015, the constant currency operating income decrease was due to strategic charges across the segment and weaker results in Japan, as well as higher Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses, including the centralization of certain costs.

INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased  11% (16% in constant currencies) and increased 9% (9% in constant currencies) in 2015 and 2014 , respectively, primarily due to higher average debt balances.

In 2014, the higher effective income tax rate was primarily due to a change in tax reserves for 2003-2010 resulting from an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction, as well as the impact of changes in tax reserves related to audit progression in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions. These items had a negative impact of 4.1% on the effective tax rate. In 2013, the effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of nearly $50 million, reflecting the retroactive impact of certain tax benefits as a result of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.8 billion in 2015 and $1.6 billion in 2014 . Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued guidance codified in Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, \"Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" which amends the guidance in ASC 605, \"Revenue Recognition.\" In July 2015, the FASB made a decision to defer by one year the effective date of its new standard to January 1, 2018, although early adoption is permitted as of January 1, 2017. The new standard allows for either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition approach. The Company does not believe that the standard will impact its recognition of revenue from company-operated restaurants or its recognition of royalties from restaurants operated by franchisees or licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees, which are based on a percent of sales. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this standard will have on the recognition of other less significant revenue transactions, such as initial fees from franchisees for new restaurant openings or new franchise terms. ##TABLE_START Cash Flows  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $6.5 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.7 billion in 2015, while cash provided by operations totaled $6.7 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.1 billion in 2014. In 2015, cash provided by operations decreased $191 million or 3% compared with 2014, primarily due to lower operating results, including the impact from weaker foreign currencies, and other operating activity. This was partly offset by changes in working capital. In 2014, cash provided by operations decreased $390 million or 5% compared with 2013 primarily due to lower operating results, partly offset by lower income tax payments. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.4 billion in 2015, a decrease of $885 million compared with 2014. The decrease primarily reflected lower capital expenditures. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.3 billion in 2014, a decrease of $369 million compared with 2013. The decrease primarily reflected lower capital expenditures, a decrease in other investing activities related to short-term time deposits and higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $735 million in 2015, an increase of $5.4 billion compared with 2014, primarily due to an increase in net borrowings, partly offset by higher treasury stock purchases. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.6 billion in 2014, an increase of $575 million compared with 2013, primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases, partly offset by an increase in net borrowings. The Companys cash and equivalents balance was $7.7 billion and $2.1 billion at year end 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in 2015 was due to higher net borrowings to be used primarily for share repurchases in 2016. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In 2015, the Company opened 989 restaurants and closed 722 restaurants. In 2014, the Company opened 1,316 restaurants and closed 487 restaurants. The increase in restaurant closings in 2015 reflected a strategic review that resulted in additional closures of under-performing restaurants. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.

Capital expenditures decreased $769 million or 30% in 2015, primarily due to fewer new restaurant openings and lower reinvestment at existing restaurants. Capital expenditures decreased $242 million or 9% in 2014, primarily due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants. In both years, the lower reinvestment primarily reflected fewer reimages. Capital expenditures invested in the U.S., International Lead markets and High Growth markets represented about 90% of the total in 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment)  McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 23 for new traditional McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $3.3 million in 2015. The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2015 and 2014. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS In 2015, the Company returned approximately $9.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid. This brings the cumulative two-year return to shareholders to $15.8 billion versus our targeted return of about $30 billion for the three-year period ending 2016.

In 2015, approximately 61.8 million shares were repurchased for $6.2 billion, bringing total purchases under the program to $8.1 billion. In December 2015, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the 2014 program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program, effective January 1, 2016, that authorizes the purchase of up to $15 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. On February 12, 2016, the Company paid $2.7 billion under an Accelerated Share Repurchase agreement and received an initial delivery of 18.5 million shares, which represents 80% of the total shares the Company expects to receive based on the market price at the time of initial delivery. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement, between April 1, 2016 and May 13, 2016, will be determined with reference to the volume weighted average price per share of the Companys common stock over the term of the agreement, less a negotiated discount. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 40 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2015 full year dividend of $ 3.44 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.85 per share, with an increase to $0.89 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 5% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $3.56 per share annual dividend and reflects the Companys confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors. ##TABLE_START Financial Position and Capital Resources  ##TABLE_ENDTOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS Total assets increased $3.7 billion or 11% in 2015. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $5.8 billion in 2015 primarily due to higher cash and equivalents. Nearly 75% of total assets were in the U.S., International Lead markets and High Growth markets at year-end 2015. Net property and equipment decreased $1.4 billion in 2015, primarily due to the impact of depreciation and foreign currency translation, partly offset by capital expenditures, and represented about 60% of total assets at year end. Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Returns on assets and equity ##TABLE_START    Return on average assets 20.9 %  21.8 %  24.8 % Return on average common equity 45.1  31.3  35.8 ##TABLE_ENDIn 2015, return on average assets decreased primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation on operating income, partly offset by lower average assets, while return on average common equity increased primarily due to lower average common equity as a result of higher treasury stock purchases. In 2014, return on average assets and return on average common equity decreased, reflecting lower operating results. Operating income does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about two percentage points for all years presented. FINANCING AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2015 totaled $24.1 billion, compared with $15.0 billion at December 31, 2014. The net increase in 2015 was primarily due to net long-term issuances of $9.7 billion in connection with the Company's plans to optimize its capital structure.

To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Under existing authorization from the Companys Board of Directors, at December 31, 2015, the Company had $4.0 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $2.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2016 is $787 million of long-term corporate debt. The Company plans to issue long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. As of December 31, 2015, the Company's subsidiaries also had $732 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $7.0 billion and $5.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Companys restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2015, the Company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to certain derivatives having negative positions. The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions. The Companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures ##TABLE_START In millions of U.S. Dollars  Euro $ 3,974  $ 4,949 British Pounds Sterling 1,333  1,460 Australian Dollars 1,316  2,038 Canadian Dollars 1,096  1,231 Russian Ruble  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2015 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2015 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. LIQUIDITY The Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where we earn about 60% of our operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. Accordingly, no U.S. federal or state income taxes have been provided on these undistributed foreign earnings. The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2015 . We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds. Consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities. In the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future. While the likelihood is remote, to the extent foreign cash is available, the Company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign  McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 25 tax credits), which could result in a use of cash. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. Refer to the Income Taxes note to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Companys borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2015 . See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details. ##TABLE_START  Contractual cash outflows   Contractual cash inflows  In millions Operating leases   Debt obligations (1)   Minimum rent under franchise arrangements   $ 1,350      $ 2,628  1,235   $ 1,065   2,534  1,113   1,755   2,449  1,001   3,844   2,355    2,464   2,240 Thereafter  6,921   15,098   18,133 Total  $ 12,515   $ 24,226   $ 30,339 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The maturities include reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $2.4 billion , as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in December 2019. Debt obligations do not include the impact of noncash fair value hedging adjustments, deferred debt costs, and accrued interest. ##TABLE_END In the U.S., the Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") limitations. At December 31, 2015 , total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $488 million . In addition, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $781 million at December 31, 2015 . There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. The amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the Companys financial position. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows. ##TABLE_START Other Matters  ##TABLE_ENDCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: ##TABLE_START  Property and equipment ##TABLE_END Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. ##TABLE_START  Share-based compensation ##TABLE_END The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Companys stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. ##TABLE_START  Long-lived assets impairment review ##TABLE_END Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Companys experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Companys estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, approximately 5-10% of goodwill may be at risk of future impairment as the fair values of certain reporting units were not substantially in excess of their carrying amounts. 26 McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report ##TABLE_START  Litigation accruals ##TABLE_END In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. ##TABLE_START  Income taxes ##TABLE_END The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. In 2015, the Company decreased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to settlements with taxing authorities by $258 million. In 2014, the Company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior years by $505 million, most of which came from foreign-related tax matters. After considering the impact of deferred tax offsets, interest and penalties, these foreign-related tax matters negatively impacted the effective tax rate by 4.1%. See the Income Taxes footnote in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the related tax reconciliations. The most significant new developments in 2014 and 2015 are described below. In 2014, the Company received an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction related to exempt income matters. As a result of this new information, the Company changed its judgment on the sustainability of this tax position for 2003-2010 and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $188 million. In 2015, the Company received an unfavorable decision related to its procedural efforts to appeal the 2014 unfavorable lower tax court ruling. As a result of this new information, the Company agreed to settle the issue for 2003-2008 with the tax authorities and the unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by $143 million. No cash payment was made related to this settlement in 2015 as the Company had previously made a payment to the taxing authority. The settlement did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows, results of operations or financial position. In 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its field examination of the Companys U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. In connection with this examination, the Company agreed to certain adjustments proposed by the IRS. The liabilities previously recorded related to these adjustments were adequate. In early 2015, the IRS issued a Revenue Agent Report for these agreed adjustments and the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was reduced by $102 million. Also in 2014 in connection with the IRS examination of 2009-2010, the Company received notices of proposed adjustments related to certain transfer pricing matters and engaged in audit defense discussions with the IRS. As a result of this new information in 2014, the Company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $38 million. The Company disagrees with these proposed adjustments and filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office in 2015. The Company expects resolution on these issues in either 2016 or 2017. In 2014, the Company received new information from tax authorities during the progression of tax audits in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions, including the receipt of proposed tax assessments primarily related to transfer pricing matters. As a result of this new information, the Company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $207 million. The Company settled certain of these tax audits in 2014 and plans to defend its position with the tax authorities on the remaining audits. In 2015, there was no significant progression on these audits. In December 2015, the European Commission opened a formal investigation directly with the Luxembourg government to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If this matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and the Company may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with Topic 740 - Income Taxes of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $14.9 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management's intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICESINFLATION The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.  McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 27 RECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL ROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of our markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Companys incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period. The denominator is the weighted-average cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. The weighted-average cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarters investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2015 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2015 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2014 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full-year impact on 2015 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2014 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Cash used for investing activities can vary significantly by quarter, resulting in a weighted-average that may be higher or lower than the simple average of the periods presented. Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows: One-year ROIIC calculation (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Increase/ (decrease)  NUMERATOR:       Operating income $ 7,145.5  $ 7,949.2   $ (803.7 ) Depreciation and amortization 1,555.7  1,644.5   (88.8 ) Currency translation (1)      919.9 Change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 27.4 DENOMINATOR:       Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (2)      $ 1,774.7 Currency translation (1)      4.1 Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 1,778.8 One-year ROIIC      1.5 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Represents one-year weighted-average cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the cash used for investing activities for each quarter in the two-year period ended December 31, 2015 . ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,   2014 Cash used for investing activities $ 1,420.0 $ 2,304.9 AS A PERCENT   Quarters ended:   March 31 87.5 % 12.5 % June 30 62.5 37.5 September 30 37.5 62.5 December 31 12.5 87.5 ##TABLE_ENDThree-year ROIIC calculation (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,   Increase/ (decrease) NUMERATOR:       Operating income $ 7,145.5  $ 8,604.6   $ (1,459.1 ) Depreciation and amortization 1,555.7  1,488.5   67.2 Currency translation (3)      1,114.4 Change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ (277.5 ) DENOMINATOR:       Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (4)      $ 7,495.6 Currency translation (3)      (66.8 ) Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates)   $ 7,428.8 Three-year ROIIC      (3.7 )% ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Represents three-year weighted-average cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the cash used for investing activities for each quarter in the four-year period ended December 31, 2015 . ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,   2014 2012 Cash used for investing activities $ 1,420.0 $ 2,304.9 $ 2,673.8 $ 3,167.3 AS A PERCENT     Quarters ended:     March 31 87.5 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 12.5 % June 30 62.5 100.0 100.0 37.5 September 30 37.5 100.0 100.0 62.5 December 31 12.5 100.0 100.0 87.5 ##TABLE_END28 McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report RISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook for 2016 .

All restaurants are operated either by the Company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchise arrangements, and foreign affiliates and developmental licensees under license agreements. The following table presents restaurant information by ownership type: ##TABLE_START Restaurants at December 31,   Conventional franchised 21,147  20,774  20,355 Developmental licensed 5,529  5,228  4,747 Foreign affiliated 3,405  3,542  3,589 Franchised 30,081  29,544  28,691 Company-operated 6,444  6,714  6,738 Systemwide restaurants 36,525  36,258  35,429 ##TABLE_ENDThe results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees were not material either individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale. CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily McDonalds Japan) are accounted for by the equity method. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers, and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the variable interest entity consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented. ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs For the annual reporting period ended December 31, 2015, the Company early adopted the Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2015-03, \"Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.\" This update requires that debt issuance costs be recorded in the balance sheet as a direct reduction of the debt liability rather than as an asset, and the amortization of debt issuance costs be recorded as interest expense. As a result of adopting this update, we have reclassified $54.0 million of debt issuance costs from \"Miscellaneous other assets\" to \"Long-term debt\" for December 31, 2014. In addition, we have reclassified $5.9 million from \"Nonoperating (income) expense, net\" to \"Interest expense, net\" for the years ending December 31, 2014 and 2013. Balance Sheet Reclassification of Deferred Taxes For the annual reporting period ended December 31, 2015, the Company early adopted ASU 2015-17, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.\" This update requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities be presented as non-current on the Balance Sheet. The Company has not retrospectively adjusted prior periods as amounts were immaterial. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and foreign affiliates. Sales by Company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis. The Company presents sales net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and may include initial fees. Continuing rent and royalties are recognized in the period earned. Initial fees are recognized upon opening of a restaurant or granting of a new franchise term, which is when the Company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise arrangement. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued guidance codified in Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, \"Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" which amends the guidance in ASC 605, \"Revenue Recognition.\" In July 2015, the FASB made a decision to defer by one year the effective date of its new standard to January 1, 2018, although early adoption is permitted as of January 1, 2017. The new standard allows for either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition approach. The Company does not believe that the standard will impact its recognition of revenue from company-operated restaurants or its recognition of royalties from restaurants operated by franchisees or licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees, which are based on a percent of sales. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this standard will have on the recognition of other less significant revenue transactions, such as initial fees from franchisees for new restaurant openings or new franchise terms. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Generally, the functional currency of operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency. ADVERTISING COSTS Advertising costs included in operating expenses of Company-operated restaurants primarily consist of contributions to advertising cooperatives and were (in millions): 2015  $718.7 ; 2014  $808.2 ; 2013  $808.4 . Production costs for radio and television advertising are expensed when the commercials are initially aired. These production costs, primarily in the U.S., as well as other marketing-related expenses included in Selling, general  administrative expenses were (in millions): 2015  $113.8 ; 2014  $98.7 ; 2013  $75.4 . Costs related to the Olympics sponsorship are included in these expenses for 2014. In addition, significant advertising costs are incurred by franchisees through contributions to advertising cooperatives in individual markets.  McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 35 SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Share-based compensation includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value. Share-based compensation expense and the effect on diluted earnings per common share were as follows: ##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data   Share-based compensation expense $ 110.0  $ 112.8  $ 89.1 After tax $ 76.0  $ 72.8  $ 60.6 Earnings per common share-diluted $ 0.08  $ 0.08  $ 0.06 ##TABLE_ENDCompensation expense related to share-based awards is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in Selling, general  administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2015 , there was $98.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for the 2015 , 2014 and 2013 stock option grants. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical trends. Expected stock price volatility is generally based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock for a period approximating the expected life. The expected dividend yield is based on the Companys most recent annual dividend rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life. Weighted-average assumptions ##TABLE_START  2014 Expected dividend yield 3.6 % 3.3 % 3.5 % Expected stock price volatility 18.8 % 20.0 % 20.6 % Risk-free interest rate 1.7 % 2.0 % 1.2 % Expected life of options (in years) 6.0 6.1 6.1 Fair value per option granted $ 10.43 $ 12.23 $ 11.09 ##TABLE_ENDPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildingsup to 40 years; leasehold improvements the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms , which generally include certain option periods; and equipment three to 12 years. LONG-LIVED ASSETS Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing McDonalds restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together in the U.S. at a television market level, and internationally, at a country level. The Company manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurants cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows. Losses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal and the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses related to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered available for sale.\" GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurant businesses. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of McDonald's restaurants from franchisees and ownership increases in subsidiaries or affiliates, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit (defined as each individual country) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit. The following table presents the 2015 activity in goodwill by segment: ##TABLE_START In millions U.S. International Lead Markets  High Growth Markets  Foundational Markets  Corporate  Consolidated  Balance at December 31, 2014 $ 1,295.8  $ 777.3  $ 352.2  $ 310.0  $ 2,735.3 Net restaurant purchases (sales) (2.4 )  9.4  0.8  3.8  11.6 Impairment losses 0.0  0.0  0.0  (80.4 )  (80.4 ) Currency translation   (88.6 )  (30.6 )  (31.0 )  (150.2 ) Balance at December 31, 2015 $ 1,293.4  $ 698.1  $ 322.4  $ 202.4  $ 2,516.3 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company conducts goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever an indicator of impairment exists. If an indicator of impairment exists (e.g., estimated earnings multiple value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value), the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit, generally based on discounted future cash flows, with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the carrying amount of goodwill. Historically, goodwill impairment has not significantly impacted the consolidated financial statements. Accumulated impairment losses at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $94.1 million and $13.7 million , respectively. In connection with the Company's global restructuring, the Company evaluated the change to its new reporting segments and determined that it is still appropriate for reporting units to be defined as each individual country when testing goodwill for impairment. 36 McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, and certain non-financial assets and liabilities on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value disclosures are reflected in a three-level hierarchy, maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: ##TABLE_START  Level 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for an identical asset or liability in an active market. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for a similar asset or liability in an active market or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END Certain of the Companys derivatives are valued using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate observable market parameters, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates, classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. Derivative valuations incorporate credit risk adjustments that are necessary to reflect the probability of default by the counterparty or the Company.  ##TABLE_START  Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value ##TABLE_END The following tables present financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the valuation hierarchy as defined in the fair value guidance:  ##TABLE_START December 31, 2015       In millions Level 1*  Level 2  Carrying Value  Derivative assets $ 139.9  $ 65.4   $ 205.3 Derivative liabilities   $ (44.4 )   $ (44.4 )         December 31, 2014       In millions Level 1*  Level 2  Carrying Value  Derivative assets $ 115.9  $ 130.2   $ 246.1 Derivative liabilities   $ (50.2 )   $ (50.2 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Level 1 is comprised of derivatives that hedge market driven changes in liabilities associated with the Companys supplemental benefit plans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis ##TABLE_END Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company recorded fair value adjustments to its long-lived assets, primarily to goodwill, based on Level 3 inputs which includes the use of a discounted cash flow valuation approach. ##TABLE_START  Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2015 , the fair value of the Companys debt obligations was estimated at $24.9 billion , compared to a carrying amount of $24.1 billion . The fair value was based on quoted market prices, Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. The carrying amount for both cash equivalents and notes receivable approximate fair value. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt and derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of these changes. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. The Company documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions, as well as all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items. The Companys derivatives that are designated for hedge accounting consist mainly of interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, foreign currency options, and cross-currency swaps, and are classified as either fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. Further details are explained in the \"Fair Value,\" \"Cash Flow\" and \"Net Investment\" hedge sections. The Company also enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Further details are explained in the Undesignated Derivatives section. All derivatives (including those not designated for hedge accounting) are recognized on the Consolidated balance sheet at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity dates. Changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments are reflected as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") and/or current earnings.  McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 37 The following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included on the Consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 : ##TABLE_START  Derivative Assets  Derivative Liabilities In millions Balance Sheet Classification    Balance Sheet Classification   Derivatives designated as hedging instruments         Foreign currency Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $ 55.0  $ 80.5  Accrued payroll and other liabilities  $ (22.5 )  $ (0.2 ) Interest rate Prepaid expenses and other current assets  0.0  2.6       Foreign currency Miscellaneous other assets  0.6  15.5  Other long-term liabilities  (13.0 )  (34.6 ) Interest rate Miscellaneous other assets  5.3  9.6  Other long-term liabilities  (3.4 )  (7.5 ) Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments  $ 60.9  $ 108.2    $ (38.9 )  $ (42.3 ) Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments         Equity Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $ 0.3  $ 120.6       Foreign currency Prepaid expenses and other current assets  4.2  17.3  Accrued payroll and other liabilities  $ (5.5 )  $ (7.9 ) Equity Miscellaneous other assets  139.9  0.0       Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments  $ 144.4  $ 137.9    $ (5.5 )  $ (7.9 ) Total derivatives  $ 205.3  $ 246.1    $ (44.4 )  $ (50.2 ) ##TABLE_ENDFair Value Hedges The Company enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure to changes in the fair values of certain liabilities. The Company's fair value hedges convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt by use of interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2015 , $2.2 billion of the Company's outstanding fixed-rate debt was effectively converted. All of the Companys interest rate swaps meet the shortcut method requirements. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying debt. No ineffectiveness has been recorded to net income related to interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the year ended December 31, 2015. ##TABLE_START Derivatives in Hedging Relationships  Gain (Loss) Recognized In Earnings on Hedging Derivative  Gain (Loss) Recognized In Earnings on Hedged Items   In millions       Interest rate   $ (3.4 )  $ (8.1 )   $ 3.4  $ 8.1 ##TABLE_ENDCash Flow Hedges The Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. The types of cash flow hedges the Company enters into include interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, foreign currency options and cross currency swaps. The effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives are reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company excludes the time value of foreign currency options from its effectiveness assessment. As a result, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to this component, as well as the ineffectiveness of the hedges, are recognized immediately in earnings. ##TABLE_START   Gain (Loss) Recognized in AOCI (Effective Portion)  Gain (Loss) Reclassified From AOCI Into Earnings (Effective Portion)  Gain (Loss) Recognized in Earnings (Amount Excluded from Effectiveness Testing and Ineffective Portion) Derivatives in Hedging Relationships       In millions          Foreign currency   $ 35.3  $ 62.0   $ 53.0  $ 11.0   $ 22.9  $ 9.5 Interest rate (1)   0.0  0.0   (0.5 )  (0.5 )   0.0  0.0    $ 35.3  $ 62.0   $ 52.5  $ 10.5   $ 22.9  $ 9.5 ##TABLE_END(1) The amount of gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI into earnings is recorded in interest expense . 38 McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report The Company periodically uses interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of floating-rate debt, including forecasted debt issuances, into fixed-rate debt. The agreements are intended to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies), the Company uses foreign currency forwards and foreign currency options to hedge a portion of anticipated exposures. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the decline in value of future foreign denominated royalties is offset by gains in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards and/or foreign currency options. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in the value of future foreign denominated royalties is offset by losses in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards and/or foreign currency options. Although the fair value changes in the foreign currency options may fluctuate over the period of the contract, the Companys total loss on a foreign currency option is limited to the upfront premium paid for the contract; however, the potential gains on a foreign currency option are unlimited. The hedges cover the next 16 months for certain exposures and are denominated in various currencies. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had derivatives outstanding with an equivalent notional amount of $373.6 million that were used to hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency denominated royalties. The Company uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the risk of cash flows associated with certain foreign currency denominated debt, including forecasted interest payments. The hedges cover periods up to 15 months and have an equivalent notional amount of $134.7 million . The Company recorded after tax adjustments to the cash flow hedging component of AOCI in shareholders equity. The Company recorded a decrease of $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and a net increase of $33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 . Based on interest rates and foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2015 , there is $20.0 million in after-tax cumulative cash flow hedging gains which is not expected to have a significant effect on earnings over the next 12 months. Net Investment Hedges The Company primarily uses foreign currency denominated debt (third party and intercompany) to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in the foreign currency translation component of AOCI, as well as the offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are liquidated or sold. As of December 31, 2015 , $6.2 billion of third party foreign currency denominated debt, $3.4 billion of intercompany foreign currency denominated debt, and $287.8 million of derivatives were designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. ##TABLE_START Derivatives in Hedging Relationships  Gain (Loss) Recognized in AOCI (Effective Portion)  In millions    Foreign currency denominated debt   $ 668.1  $ 954.6 Foreign currency derivatives   79.1  126.6   $ 747.2  $ 1,081.2 ##TABLE_ENDUndesignated Derivatives The Company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting, therefore the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings together with the gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. As an example, the Company enters into equity derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Selling, general  administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in Nonoperating (income) expense, net, along with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position.  ##TABLE_START Derivatives Not Designated for Hedge Accounting  Gain (Loss) Recognized in Earnings  In millions    Foreign currency   $ 14.6  $ 10.4 Equity   38.9  23.5    $ 53.5  $ 33.9 ##TABLE_ENDCredit Risk The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its hedging instruments. The counterparties to these agreements consist of a diverse group of financial institutions and market participants. The Company continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and adjusts positions as appropriate. The Company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2015 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. For financial reporting purposes, the Company presents gross derivative balances in the financial statements and supplementary data, even for counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2015 , the Company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to certain derivatives having negative positions. The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions. INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES The Company, like other multi-national companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. Accordingly, tax liabilities are recorded when, in managements judgment, a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may still be recorded depending on managements assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled. The Company records interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.  McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 39 PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION Diluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of shares): 2015  5.2 ; 2014  5.8 ; 2013  7.6 . Stock options that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutive were (in millions of shares): 2015  1.0 ; 2014  5.3 ; 2013  4.7 . In the first quarter of 2016, the Company paid $2.7 billion under an Accelerated Share Repurchase agreement and received an initial delivery of 18.5 million shares, which represents 80% of the total shares the Company expects to receive based on the market price at the time of initial delivery. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement, between April 1, 2016 and May 13, 2016, will be determined with reference to the volume weighted average price per share of the Company's common stock over the term of the agreement, less a negotiated discount. The transaction is accounted for as an equity transaction and is included in Treasury stock when the shares are received, at which time there is an immediate reduction in the weighted average common shares calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share. CASH AND EQUIVALENTS The Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). There were no subsequent events that required recognition or disclosure. ##TABLE_START Property and Equipment  ##TABLE_ENDNet property and equipment consisted of: ##TABLE_START In millions December 31, 2015   Land  $ 5,582.5  $ 5,788.4 Buildings and improvements on owned land  14,011.7  14,322.4 Buildings and improvements on leased land  12,892.9  13,284.0 Equipment, signs and seating  4,658.5  5,113.8 Other  546.8  617.5   37,692.4  39,126.1 Accumulated depreciation and amortization  (14,574.8 )  (14,568.6 ) Net property and equipment  $ 23,117.6  $ 24,557.5 ##TABLE_ENDDepreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment was (in millions): 2015  $1,438.0 ; 2014  $1,539.3 ; 2013  $1,498.8 . ##TABLE_START Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START In millions   Gains on sales of restaurant businesses $ (145.9 )  $ (137.4 )  $ (199.4 ) Equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates 146.8  8.9  (78.2 ) Asset dispositions and other (income) expense, net (26.6 )  108.2  30.4 Impairment and other charges 235.1  38.9  0.0 Total $ 209.4  $ 18.6  $ (247.2 ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Gains on sales of restaurant businesses ##TABLE_END The Companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market.

In addition, these charges include costs associated with strategic initiatives, such as refranchising and restructuring activities. ##TABLE_START Contingencies  ##TABLE_ENDIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 40 McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report ##TABLE_START Franchise Arrangements  ##TABLE_ENDConventional franchise arrangements generally include a lease and a license and provide for payment of initial fees, as well as continuing rent and royalties to the Company based upon a percent of sales with minimum rent payments that parallel the Companys underlying leases and escalations (on properties that are leased). Under this arrangement, franchisees are granted the right to operate a restaurant using the McDonalds System and, in most cases, the use of a restaurant facility, generally for a period of 20 years . These franchisees pay related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. Affiliates and developmental licensees operating under license agreements pay a royalty to the Company based upon a percent of sales, and may pay initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants consisted of: ##TABLE_START In millions   Rents $ 5,860.6  $ 6,106.7  $ 6,054.4 Royalties 2,980.7  3,085.1  3,100.4 Initial fees 83.4  80.2  76.7 Revenues from franchised restaurants $ 8,924.7  $ 9,272.0  $ 9,231.5 ##TABLE_ENDFuture gross minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements are: ##TABLE_START In millions Owned sites   Leased sites   Total  $ 1,293.0   $ 1,334.9  $ 2,627.9  1,245.2   1,288.4  2,533.6  1,211.7   1,237.2  2,448.9  1,176.8   1,178.5  2,355.3  1,136.0   1,104.4  2,240.4 Thereafter  9,714.9   8,418.3  18,133.2 Total minimum payments  $ 15,777.6   $ 14,561.7  $ 30,339.3 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2015 , net property and equipment under franchise arrangements totaled $14.9 billion (including land of $4.4 billion ) after deducting accumulated depreciation and amortization of $8.4 billion . ##TABLE_START Leasing Arrangements  ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2015 , the Company was the lessee at 15,115 restaurant locations through ground leases (the Company leases the land and the Company or franchisee owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases land and buildings). Lease terms for most restaurants, where market conditions allow, are generally for 20 years and, in many cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options, with certain leases providing purchase options. Escalation terms vary by market with examples including fixed-rent escalations, escalations based on an inflation index, and fair-value market adjustments. The timing of these escalations generally ranges from annually to every five years. For most locations, the Company is obligated for the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance; however, for franchised sites, the Company requires the franchisees to pay these costs. In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-cancelable leases covering certain offices and vehicles.

The remainder will expire at various dates from 2016 to 2031. The Company's effective income tax rate is typically lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because non-U.S. income is generally subject to local statutory country tax rates that are below the 35% U.S. statutory tax rate and reflect the impact of global transfer pricing. The statutory U.S. federal income tax rate reconciles to the effective income tax rates as follows: ##TABLE_START    Statutory U.S. federal income tax rate 35.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % State income taxes, net of related federal income tax benefit 1.6  1.6  1.3 Foreign income taxed at different rates (4.9 )  (4.8 )  (5.1 ) Taxes related to unfavorable lower tax court ruling and audit progression in foreign tax jurisdictions 0.0  4.1  0.0 Cash repatriation (2.3 )  (1.2 )  (0.5 ) Other, net 1.5  0.8  1.2 Effective income tax rates 30.9 %  35.5 %  31.9 % ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Companys gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $781.2 million and $988.1 million , respectively. After considering the deferred tax accounting impact, it is expected that about $470 million of the total as of December 31, 2015 would favorably affect the effective tax rate if resolved in the Companys favor. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START In millions  Balance at January 1 $ 988.1  $ 512.7 Decreases for positions taken in prior years (49.9 )  (19.5 ) Increases for positions taken in prior years 30.5  504.7 Increases for positions related to the current year 83.7  80.7 Settlements with taxing authorities (258.0 )  (78.0 ) Lapsing of statutes of limitations (13.2 )  (12.5 ) Balance at December 31 (1) $ 781.2  $ 988.1 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Of this amount, $704.0 million and $909.0 million are included in Other long-term liabilities for 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and $21.9 million and $19.5 million are included in Current liabilities - income taxes for 2015 and 2014, respectively, on the Consolidated balance sheet. The remainder is included in Deferred income taxes on the Consolidated balance sheet. ##TABLE_END In 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") concluded its field examination of the Company's 2009 and 2010 U.S. federal income tax returns. In connection with this examination, the Company agreed to certain adjustments that had been proposed by the IRS and appropriately accounted for these adjustments in accordance with ASC 740. In early 2015, the IRS issued a Revenue Agent Report for these agreed adjustments,and the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was reduced accordingly. Also in connection with this examination, in 2014 the Company received notices of proposed adjustments (\"NOPAs\") related to certain transfer pricing matters. The Company disagrees with the IRS' proposed adjustments and filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office in 2015. The Company is also under audit in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions for matters primarily related to transfer pricing. In addition, the Company is under audit in multiple state tax jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease up to $250 million within the next 12 months, of which up to $50 million could favorably affect the effective tax rate. This would be due to the possible settlement of the 2009 and 2010 IRS protest, completion of the aforementioned foreign and state tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions. In addition, it is reasonably possible that, as a result of audit progression in both the U.S. and foreign tax audits within the next 12 months, there may be new information that causes the 42 McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report Company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded. While the Company cannot estimate the impact that new information may have on our unrecognized tax benefit balance, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined under ASC 740. The Company operates within multiple tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2009. The Company had $83.6 million and $119.0 million accrued for interest and penalties at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalties related to tax matters of $21.1 million in 2015 , $87.9 million in 2014 , and $14.4 million in 2013 , which are included in the provision for income taxes. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. These temporary differences were approximately $14.9 billion at December 31, 2015 and consisted primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. Determination of the deferred income tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.  ##TABLE_START Employee Benefit Plans  ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys Profit Sharing and Savings Plan for U.S.-based employees includes a 401(k) feature, a regular employer match, and a discretionary employer match. The 401(k) feature allows participants to make pre-tax contributions that are matched each pay period from shares released under the leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") and employer cash contributions. The Profit Sharing and Savings Plan also provides for a discretionary employer match after the end of the year for match-eligible participants. All current account balances, future contributions and related earnings can be invested in eleven investment alternatives as well as McDonalds stock in accordance with each participants investment elections. Future participant contributions are limited to 20% investment in McDonalds stock. Participants may choose to make separate investment choices for current account balances and future contributions. The Company also maintains certain nonqualified supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan because of IRS limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities were $487.6 million at December 31, 2015 , and $534.0 million at December 31, 2014 , and were primarily included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheet. The Company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of the liabilities. At December 31, 2015 , derivatives with a fair value of $139.9 million indexed to the Company's stock and a total return swap with a notional amount of $180.6 million indexed to certain market indices were included at their fair value in Miscellaneous other assets and Prepaid expenses and other current assets, respectively, on the Consolidated balance sheet. Changes in liabilities for these nonqualified plans and in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded primarily in Selling, general  administrative expenses. Changes in fair value of the derivatives indexed to the Companys stock are recorded in the income statement because the contracts provide the counterparty with a choice to settle in cash or shares.  Total U.S. costs for the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan, including nonqualified benefits and related hedging activities, were (in millions): 2015  $24.0 ; 2014  $29.1 ; 2013  $21.9 . Certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. also offer profit sharing, stock purchase or other similar benefit plans. Total plan costs outside the U.S. were (in millions): 2015  $53.4 ; 2014  $54.4 ; 2013  $51.2 . The total combined liabilities for international retirement plans were $76.0 million and $74.7 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Other post-retirement benefits and post- employment benefits were immaterial.

Corporate assets include corporate cash and equivalents, asset portions of financial instruments and home office facilities. ##TABLE_START In millions    U.S. $ 8,558.9  $ 8,651.0  $ 8,851.3  International Lead Markets 7,614.9  8,544.5  8,535.3  High Growth Markets 6,172.8  6,845.2  7,043.2  Foundational Markets  Corporate 3,066.4  3,400.6  3,675.9  Total revenues $ 25,413.0  $ 27,441.3  $ 28,105.7  U.S. $ 3,612.0  $ 3,522.5  $ 3,779.3  International Lead Markets 2,712.6  3,034.5  3,028.8  High Growth Markets 841.1  933.9  1,250.0  Foundational Markets  Corporate (20.2 )  458.3  706.2  Total operating income $ 7,145.5  $ 7,949.2  $ 8,764.3  U.S. $ 11,806.1  $ 11,872.1  $ 11,711.8  International Lead Markets 11,136.3  12,538.4  14,815.5  High Growth Markets 5,248.6  5,866.0  6,335.5  Foundational Markets  Corporate 9,747.7  3,950.9  3,763.5  Total assets $ 37,938.7  $ 34,227.4  $ 36,626.3  U.S. $ 533.2  $ 736.1  $ 875.5  International Lead Markets 596.1  792.1  793.3  High Growth Markets 540.5  804.8  831.1  Foundational Markets  Corporate 144.1  250.4  324.8  Total capital expenditures $ 1,813.9  $ 2,583.4  $ 2,824.7  U.S. $ 515.2  $ 512.2  $ 503.6  International Lead Markets 460.9  521.2  507.4  High Growth Markets 363.9  387.8  357.3  Foundational Markets  Corporate 215.7  223.3  216.8  Total depreciation and amortization $ 1,555.7  $ 1,644.5  $ 1,585.1  ##TABLE_ENDTotal long-lived assets, primarily property and equipment, were (in millions)Consolidated: 2015  $27,607.8 ; 2014  $29,264.7 ; 2013  $30,679.8 ; U.S. based: 2015  $11,940.4 ; 2014  $11,883.1 ; 2013  $11,632.2 . 44 McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report ##TABLE_START Debt Financing  ##TABLE_ENDLINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS At December 31, 2015 , the Company had a $2.5 billion line of credit agreement expiring in December 2019 with fees of 0.070% per annum on the total commitment, which remained unused. Fees and interest rates on this line are based on the Companys long-term credit rating assigned by Moodys and Standard  Poors . In addition, the Company's subsidiaries had unused lines of credit that were primarily uncommitted, short-term and denominated in various currencies at local market rates of interest . The weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings was 2.0% at December 31, 2015 (based on $731.6 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings and $869.6 million of commercial paper) and 4.1% at December 31, 2014 (based on $862.9 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings and $200.0 million of commercial paper). DEBT OBLIGATIONS The Company has incurred debt obligations principally through public and private offerings and bank loans. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions, and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. Under certain agreements, the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at par or at a premium over par. The Company has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt prior to maturity. The following table summarizes the Companys debt obligations (interest rates and debt amounts reflected in the table include the effects of interest rate swaps). ##TABLE_START    Interest rates (1) December 31    Amounts outstanding December 31  In millions of U.S. Dollars Maturity dates      Fixed   4.0 %  4.5 %   $ 14,190.6  $ 6,604.7 Floating   3.3  3.2   3,019.6  2,450.0 Total U.S. Dollars 2016-2045       17,210.2  9,054.7 Fixed   2.4  3.2   3,951.9  3,014.7 Floating   0.3  2.9   665.9  320.3 Total Euro 2016-2029       4,617.8  3,335.0 Total British Pounds Sterling - Fixed 2020-2054  5.3  5.3   1,100.1  1,163.3 Total Chinese Renminbi - Floating  4.3  5.6   491.8  630.1 Fixed   2.9  2.9   104.0  104.3 Floating   0.3  0.3   208.0  208.6 Total Japanese Yen 2016-2030       312.0  312.9 Fixed   2.1  2.1   264.7  268.3 Floating   3.1  4.0   229.7  220.7 Total other currencies (2) 2016-2056       494.4  489.0 Debt obligations before fair value adjustments and deferred debt costs (3)        24,226.3  14,985.0 Fair value adjustments (4)        1.8  4.7 Deferred debt costs (5)        (106.0 )  (54.0 ) Total debt obligations (6)        $ 24,122.1  $ 14,935.7 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Weighted-average effective rate, computed on a semi-annual basis. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Primarily consists of Swiss Francs and Korean Won. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Aggregate maturities for 2015 debt balances, before fair value adjustments and deferred debt costs, were as follows (in millions): 2016  $0.0 ; 2017  $1,065.1 ; 2018  $1,755.3 ; 2019  $3,844.2 ; 2020  $2,463.9 ; Thereafter $15,097.8 .

The Company early adopted this Update and reclassified the prior year amount. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6) The net increase in 2015 was primarily due to net issuances of $9.7 billion in connection with the Company's plan to optimize its capital structure. ##TABLE_END  McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 45 ##TABLE_START Share-based Compensation  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company maintains a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plans was 62.1 million at December 31, 2015 , including 37.8 million available for future grants. STOCK OPTIONS Stock options to purchase common stock are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Companys stock on the date of grant. Substantially all of the options become exercisable in four equal installments, beginning a year from the date of the grant, and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. Intrinsic value for stock options is defined as the difference between the current market value of the Companys stock and the exercise price. During 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $202.9 million , $258.9 million and $325.2 million , respectively. Cash received from stock options exercised during 2015 was $317.2 million and the tax benefit realized from stock options exercised totaled $63.0 million . The Company uses treasury shares purchased under the Companys share repurchase program to satisfy share-based exercises. A summary of the status of the Companys stock option grants as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , and changes during the years then ended, is presented in the following table: ##TABLE_START       Options Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price   Weighted- average remaining contractual life in years  Aggregate intrinsic value in millions   Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price   Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price  Outstanding at beginning of year 23.4   $ 77.99       25.1   $ 69.15  27.4   $ 59.86 Granted 4.3   97.33       3.9   95.13  3.7   94.36 Exercised (5.1 )   62.59       (5.1 )   46.09  (5.7 )   40.12 Forfeited/expired (0.7 )   96.76       (0.5 )   94.56  (0.3 )   79.15 Outstanding at end of year 21.9   $ 84.76  6.2   $ 730.7  23.4   $ 77.99  25.1   $ 69.15 Exercisable at end of year 13.4   $ 77.31  4.9   $ 546.5  14.4     15.6    ##TABLE_ENDRSUs RSUs generally vest 100% on the third anniversary of the grant and are payable in either shares of McDonalds common stock or cash, at the Companys discretion.

The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: ##TABLE_START I. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START II. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START III. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ##TABLE_END There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may vary over time. Management assessed the design and effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on managements assessment using those criteria, as of December 31, 2015 , management believes that the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. Ernst  Young, LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 and the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 . Their reports are presented on the following pages. The independent registered public accountants and internal auditors advise management of the results of their audits, and make recommendations to improve the system of internal controls. Management evaluates the audit recommendations and takes appropriate action. McDONALDS CORPORATION February 25, 2016 48 McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report ##TABLE_START Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  ##TABLE_ENDThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonalds Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McDonalds Corporation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of McDonalds Corporation at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), McDonalds Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 25, 2016 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. ERNST  YOUNG LLP Chicago, Illinois February 25, 2016  McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 49 ##TABLE_START Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  ##TABLE_ENDThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonalds Corporation We have audited McDonald's Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). McDonalds Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report on Managements Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, McDonalds Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of McDonalds Corporation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 , and our report dated February 25, 2016 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Controls and Procedures  ##TABLE_ENDDISCLOSURE CONTROLS An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2015 .

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Companys management, including the CEO and CFO, confirm that there was no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

Business  ##TABLE_ENDMcDonalds Corporation, the registrant, together with its sub-sidiaries, is referred to herein as the Company. a. General During 2016, there were no material changes to the Company's corporate structure or in its method of conducting business. The business is structured with segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth. Significant reportable segments include the United States (\"U.S.\"), International Lead Markets and High Growth Markets. In addition, throughout this report we present the Foundational Markets  Corporate segment, which includes markets in over 80 countries, as well as Corporate activities. b. Financial information about segments Segment data for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 are included in Part II, Item 8, page 44 of this Form 10-K. c. Narrative description of business ##TABLE_START  General ##TABLE_END The Company operates and franchises McDonalds restaurants, which serve a locally-relevant menu of quality food and beverages sold at various price points in more than 100 countries. McDonalds global system is comprised of both Company-owned and franchised restaurants. McDonalds franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures - conventional franchise, developmental license or affiliate. The optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant, trading area or market (country) is based on a variety of factors, including the availability of individuals with the entrepreneurial experience and financial resources, as well as the local legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property ownership and franchising. We continually review our mix of Company-owned and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be approximately 95% franchised over the long term. The business relationship between McDonalds and its independent franchisees is of fundamental importance to overall performance and to the McDonalds brand. This business relationship is supported by an agreement that requires adherence to standards and policies essential to protecting our brand. The Company is primarily a franchisor, with approximately 85% of McDonald's restaurants currently owned and operated by independent franchisees. Franchising enables an individual to be their own employer and maintain control over all employment related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of McDonalds global brand, operating system and financial resources. One of the strengths of this model is that the expertise gained from operating Company-owned restaurants allows McDonalds to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and, when viable, efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants. Directly operating McDonalds restaurants contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor. Having Company-owned restaurants provides Company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience. In addition, in our Company-owned and operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we are able to further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit relevant McDonalds restaurants. Under a conventional franchise arrangement, the Company generally owns the land and building or secures a long-term lease for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment, signs, seating and dcor. The Company believes that ownership of real estate, combined with the co-investment by franchisees, enables us to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. Franchisees are also responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time. In addition, to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives, the Company frequently co-invests with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or their operating systems. These investments, developed with input from McDonalds with the aim of improving local business performance, increase the value of our brand through the development of modernized, more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants. The Companys typical franchise term is 20 years. The Company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors. The business relationship with franchisees is designed to assure consistency and high quality at all McDonalds restaurants. Conventional franchisees contribute to the Companys revenue through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees paid upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new franchise. This structure enables McDonalds to generate significant levels of cash flow. Under a developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest. The Company does not invest any capital under a developmental license arrangement. The Company receives a royalty based upon a percent of sales as well as initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license. We use the developmental license ownership structure in over 80 countries with a total of approximately 6,300 restaurants. The largest developmental licensee operates approximately 2,200 restaurants in 19 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. In early 2017, the Company announced the sale of its businesses in China and Hong Kong, including more than 1,750 company-operated restaurants, to a developmental licensee. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will retain a 20% ownership in the business.The Company expects to complete the sale and licensing transaction mid-year 2017. Finally, the Company also has an equity investment in a limited number of foreign affiliated markets, referred to as affiliates. In these markets, the Company receives a royalty based on a percent of sales and records its share of net results in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. The largest of these affiliates is Japan, where there are nearly 3,000 restaurants. ##TABLE_START  Supply Chain and Quality Assurance ##TABLE_END The Company and its franchisees purchase food, packaging, equipment and other goods from numerous independent suppliers. The Company has established and enforces high quality standards and product specifications. The Company has quality centers around the world designed to ensure that its high standards are consistently met. The quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews, but also on-site supplier visits. A Food Safety Advisory Council, composed of the Companys technical, safety and supply chain specialists, as well as suppliers and outside academia, provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food safety. In addition, the Company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation, assure best practices and drive continuous improvement. Leveraging scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies, the Company also collaborates with suppliers toward a goal of  McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 1 achieving competitive, predictable food and paper costs over the long term. Independently owned and operated distribution centers, approved by the Company, distribute products and supplies to McDonalds restaurants. In addition, restaurant personnel are trained in the proper storage, handling and preparation of products. ##TABLE_START  Products ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu, although there are geographic variations to suit local consumer preferences and tastes. In addition, McDonalds tests new products on an ongoing basis. McDonalds menu includes hamburgers and cheeseburgers, Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Filet-O-Fish, several chicken sandwiches, Chicken McNuggets, wraps, french fries, salads, oatmeal, shakes, McFlurry desserts, sundaes, soft serve cones, pies, soft drinks, coffee, McCaf beverages and other beverages. In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of other products during limited-time promotions. McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. and many international markets offer a full or limited breakfast menu. Breakfast offerings may include Egg McMuffin, Sausage McMuffin with Egg, McGriddles, biscuit and bagel sandwiches and hotcakes. Quality, choice and nutrition are increasingly important to our customers and we are continuously evolving our menu to meet our customers' needs. ##TABLE_START  Marketing ##TABLE_END McDonalds global brand is well known. Marketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed to promote McDonalds brand and differentiate the Company from competitors. Marketing and promotional efforts focus on value, quality, food taste, menu choice, nutrition, convenience and the customer experience. ##TABLE_START  Intellectual property ##TABLE_END The Company owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information. The Company considers the trademarks McDonalds and The Golden Arches Logo to be of material importance to its business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. Patents, copyrights and licenses are of varying durations. ##TABLE_START  Seasonal operations ##TABLE_END The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree. ##TABLE_START  Working capital practices ##TABLE_END Information about the Companys working capital practices is incorporated herein by reference to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 in Part II, Item 7, pages 13 through 27, and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 in Part II, Item 8, page 32 of this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START  Customers ##TABLE_END The Companys business is not dependent upon either a single customer or small group of customers. ##TABLE_START  Backlog ##TABLE_END Company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders. ##TABLE_START  Government contracts ##TABLE_END No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at government election. ##TABLE_START  Competition ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of food products. The Company competes on the basis of price, convenience, service, menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry. In measuring the Companys competitive position, management reviews data compiled by Euromonitor International, a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry. The Companys primary competition, which is referred to as the informal eating out (\"IEO\") segment, includes the following restaurant categories defined by Euromonitor International: quick-service eating establishments, casual dining full-service restaurants, street stalls or kiosks, cafs,100% home delivery/takeaway providers, specialist coffee shops, self-service cafeterias and juice/smoothie bars. The IEO segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and full-service restaurants other than casual dining. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the global IEO segment was composed of approximately 8 million outlets and generated $1.2 trillion in annual sales in 2015 , the most recent year for which data is available. McDonalds Systemwide 2015 restaurant business accounted for 0.4% of those outlets and 7.0% of the sales. Management also on occasion benchmarks McDonalds against the entire restaurant industry, including the IEO segment defined above and all other full-service restaurants. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 18 million outlets and generated $2.3 trillion in annual sales in 2015 . McDonalds Systemwide restaurant business accounted for 0.2% of those outlets and 3.5% of the sales. ##TABLE_START  Research and development ##TABLE_END The Company operates research and development facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. While research and development activities are important to the Companys business, these expenditures are not material. Independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the \"System\"). ##TABLE_START  Environmental matters ##TABLE_END The Company continuously endeavors to improve its social responsibility and environmental practices to achieve long-term sustainability, which benefits McDonalds and the communities it serves. Increased focus by certain governmental authorities on environmental matters may lead to new governmental initiatives. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. Although the impact would likely vary by world region and/or market, we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs for the Company. Also, there is a possibility that governmental initiatives, or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns, climate, or water resources could have a direct impact on the operations of the System in ways which we cannot predict at this time. The Company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner. At this time, the Company has already begun to undertake its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment, including the implementation of more energy efficient equipment and management of energy use and more sustainable sourcing practices in many of its markets. 2 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report ##TABLE_START  Number of employees ##TABLE_END The Companys number of employees worldwide, including its corporate office employees and company-owned restaurant employees, was approximately 375,000 as of year-end 2016 . d. Financial information about geographic areas Financial information about geographic areas is incorporated herein by reference to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7, pages 13  through 27 and Segment and geographic information in Part II, Item 8, page 44 of this Form 10-K. e.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  ##TABLE_END The information in this report includes forward-looking statements about future events and circumstances and their effects upon revenues, expenses and business opportunities. Generally speaking, any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by the use of forward-looking words, such as may, will, expect, believe and plan or similar expressions. In particular, statements regarding our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry are forward-looking statements. They reflect our expectations, are not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the date of this report. Except as required by law, we do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements. Our business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are reflected in the following considerations and factors, as well as elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. If any of these considerations or risks materialize, our expectations may change and our performance may be adversely affected.  If we do not successfully design and execute against our new business strategies within our new organization structure, we may not be able to increase operating income or market share.  To drive future results, we must design business strategies that are effective in delivering operating income growth. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our Systems ability to:  ##TABLE_START  Continue to innovate and differentiate the McDonalds experience in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability;  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Reinvest in our restaurants and identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants;  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Provide clean and friendly environments that deliver a consistent McDonald's experience and demonstrate high service levels;  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Drive restaurant improvements that achieve optimal capacity, particularly during peak mealtime hours; and  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Manage the complexity of our restaurant operations.  ##TABLE_END If we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.  The implementation of our turnaround plan may intensify the risks we face and may not be successful in achieving improved performance.  Our turnaround plan includes an accelerated pace of refranchising, cost savings initiatives and global restructuring. As we continue to implement our plans, the existing risks we face in our business may be intensified. Our efforts to reduce costs and capital expenditures depend, in part, upon our refranchising efforts, which, in turn, depend upon our ability to select qualified and capable franchisees and licensees. Our cost savings initiatives also depend upon our ability to achieve efficiencies through the consolidation of global, back-office functions. Therefore, if our turnaround-related initiatives are not successful, take longer to complete than initially projected, or are not well executed, or if our cost reduction efforts adversely impact our effectiveness, our business operations, financial results and results of operations could be adversely affected.  Our investments to enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected returns.  We will continue to build upon our investments in Experience of the Future (EOTF), which focus on restaurant modernization and technology and digital engagement in order to transform the restaurant experience. As we accelerate our pace of converting restaurants to EOTF, we are placing renewed emphasis on our improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives. We may not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments and therefore our business results may suffer.   McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 3 We face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business.  We compete primarily in the informal eating out (IEO) segment, which is highly competitive. We are facing sluggish restaurant industry trends in several key markets, including the U.S. We also face sustained, intense competition from traditional, fast casual and other competitors, which may include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores, grocery stores and coffee shops. We expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive, and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by new or continuing actions of our competitors, which may have a short- or long-term impact on our results.  We compete on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. In particular, we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, develop new products, price our products appropriately, deliver a relevant customer experience, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations and respond effectively to our competitors actions. Recognizing these dependencies, we have intensified our focus in recent periods on strategies to achieve these goals, including the turnaround plan described above, and we will likely continue to modify our strategies and implement new strategies in the future. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics.  If we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences, our business could suffer.  Our continued success depends on our Systems ability to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics, and trends in food sourcing, food preparation and consumer preferences in the IEO segment. In order to deliver a relevant experience for our customers amidst a highly competitive, value-driven operating environment, we must implement initiatives to adapt at an aggressive pace. There is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful and, if they are not, our financial results could be adversely impacted.  If pricing, promotional and marketing plans are not effective, our results may be negatively impacted.  Our results depend on the impact of pricing, promotional and marketing plans across the System, and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer preferences, as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions. Existing or future pricing strategies, and the value proposition they represent, are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy; however, they may not be successful and could negatively impact sales and margins. Further, the promotion of menu offerings may yield results below the desired levels.  Additionally, we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful, and we may fail to attract and retain customers. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels allows us to reach our customers effectively. If the advertising and marketing programs are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease.  Failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have a negative impact on our financial results.  To be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brand. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions. Those perceptions are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, our business practices and the manner in which we source the commodities we use. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the IEO segment or perceptions of our brand generally or relative to available alternatives. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by third parties presenting or promoting adverse commentary or portrayals of the quick-service category of the IEO segment, our brand and/or our operations, our suppliers or our franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing such adverse commentary or portrayals, our brand and our financial results may suffer.  Additionally, the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our sustainability initiatives, which require System-wide coordination and alignment. If we are not effective in addressing social responsibility matters or achieving relevant sustainability goals, consumer trust in our brand may suffer. In particular, business incidents that erode consumer trust or confidence, particularly if such incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results.  Unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results.  Our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions, which can vary significantly by market and can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits. Economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including hostilities, epidemics and actions taken by governments to manage national and international economic matters, whether through austerity or stimulus measures or trade measures, and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers. Continued adverse economic conditions or adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could pressure our operating performance, and our business and financial results may suffer.  Our results of operations are also affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect reported earnings.  Supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.  We depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient product supply, including on favorable terms. Although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain products have limited suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers. Supply chain interruptions, including shortages and transportation issues, and price increases can adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. Such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers, franchisees or us. If we experience interruptions in our Systems supply chain, our costs could increase and it could limit the availability of products critical to our Systems operations.  4 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report Food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.  Our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our Systems ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonalds of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future. Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe food products, including as our menu evolves. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. Instances of food tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our brand and reputation as well as our revenues and profits.  Our franchise business model presents a number of risks.  Our success increasingly relies on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, yet we have limited influence over their operations. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from Company-operated restaurants. Our franchisees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. If our franchisees do not experience sales growth, our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result. Also, if sales trends worsen for franchisees, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, restaurant closures or delayed or reduced payments to us. Our refranchising effort will increase that dependence and the effect of those factors.  Our success also increasingly depends on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. Franchisees ability to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general or by the creditworthiness of our franchisees or the Company. Our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, the brands image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.  Our ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing. Our ability to achieve the benefits of our refranchising strategy, which involves a shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants, in a timely manner or at all, will depend on various factors, including our ability to timely and effectively select franchisees and/or licensees that meet our rigorous standards and/or to complete transactions on favorable terms and to manage associated risks. It will also depend on the performance of our franchisees, and whether the resulting ownership mix supports our financial objectives.  Challenges with respect to talent management could harm our business.  Effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Failure effectively to identify, develop and retain key personnel, recruit high-quality candidates and ensure smooth management and personnel transitions could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results.  Our success depends in part on our Systems ability to recruit, motivate and retain a qualified workforce to work in our restaurants in an intensely competitive environment. Increased costs associated with recruiting, motivating and retaining qualified employees to work in our Company-operated restaurants could have a negative impact on our Company-operated margins. Similar concerns apply to our franchisees.  We are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and international regulations affecting our workforce, which includes our staff and employees working in our Company-operated restaurants. These regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues, including wage and hour, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. Our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers (or perceptions thereof) could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business. Additionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to recruit and retain talent) or the franchisees and suppliers that are also part of the McDonald's System and whose performance may have a material impact on our results.  Changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.  The profitability of our Company-operated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, including food, paper, supply, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs. Any volatility in certain commodity prices could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability. The commodity markets for some of the ingredients we use, such as beef and chicken, are particularly volatile due to factors such as seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, international commodity markets, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulation, all of which are beyond our control and, in many instances, unpredictable. We can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities, and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability.  The global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business.  We encounter differing cultural, regulatory and economic environments within and among the more than 100 countries where McDonalds restaurants operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on the System's success in these environments. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our Systems ability to leverage operating successes across markets. Planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with McDonald's customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts.  Disruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price,  McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 5 foreign exchange or changes in trade-related tariffs or controls, government-mandated closure of our, our franchisees' or our suppliers operations, and asset seizures. The cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or inquiries, whether or not they have merit, may impact our results and could cause reputational or other harm. Our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brand-building initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental investigations or inquiries.  Additionally, challenges and uncertainties are associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. Such challenges may be exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. An inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  We may also face challenges and uncertainties in developed markets. For example, as a result of the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union through a negotiated exit over a period of time, it is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities, as well as potential referenda in the U.K. and/or other European countries, that could cause uncertainty in European or worldwide economic conditions. In the short term, the decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates, and the resulting depression in those exchange rates may continue. Any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability.  We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world. In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or policy or related authoritative interpretations, including to the extent that corporate tax reform becomes a key component of budgetary initiatives in the United States or elsewhere. We are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by taxing authorities outside of the U.S. or the IRS in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. Any increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.  Information technology system failures or interruptions or breaches of network security may interrupt our operations.  We are increasingly reliant on technological systems, such as point-of-sale and other in-store systems or platforms, as well as technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration internally, with affiliated entities, or with independent third parties to conduct our business, including technology-enabled solutions provided to us by third parties. Any failure of these systems could significantly impact our operations and customer perceptions.  Despite the implementation of security measures, those technology systems and solutions could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. The third party solutions also present the risks faced by the third partys business. If those systems or solutions were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we could experience an interruption in our operations.  Furthermore, security breaches involving our systems, the systems of the parties we communicate or collaborate with, or those of third party providers may occur, such as unauthorized access, denial of service, computer viruses and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Our information technology systems contain personal, financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. An actual or alleged security breach could result in system disruptions, shutdowns, theft or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. The occurrence of any of these incidents could result in adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, and criminal penalties or civil liabilities.  Increasing regulatory complexity may adversely affect restaurant operations and our financial results.  Our regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. We are affected by the cost, compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face, including where inconsistent standards imposed by multiple governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.  Our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of new, potential or changing regulations that can affect our business plans and operations. These regulations include product packaging, marketing, the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices; and compliance efforts may be affected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers (particularly given varying requirements and practices for testing and disclosure).  Additionally, we are working to manage the risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources. These risks include the increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, such as packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. These risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them. These risks could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  We are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us.  Increasing legal complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. We could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, employment and personal injury claims, landlord/tenant disputes, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former franchisees and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another partys trademarks, copyrights or patents).  6 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to regulatory proceedings or litigation.  Litigation involving our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law purposes, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. Similarly, although our commercial relationships with our suppliers remain independent, there may be attempts to challenge that independence, which, if determined adversely, could also increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our suppliers, and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. We are also subject to legal and compliance risks and associated liability, such as in the areas of privacy and data collection, protection and management, as it relates to information we collect and share when we provide optional technology-related services and platforms to third parties.  Our operating results could also be affected by the following:  ##TABLE_START  The relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings;  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The cost and other effects of settlements, judgments or consent decrees, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products;  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices; and  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The scope and terms of insurance or indemnification protections that we may have.  ##TABLE_END A judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage or third party indemnity could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt our business.  We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the McDonalds brand and our business.  The success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products.  We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the United States in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. In particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business.  We cannot ensure that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property.  Changes in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future operations and results.  New accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results. We may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings. In assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, consumer and demographic trends, and our restructuring activities. If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. If we experience any such changes, they could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods.  A decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability.  Our credit ratings may be negatively affected by our results of operations or changes in our debt levels. As a result, our interest expense, the availability of acceptable counterparties, our ability to obtain funding on favorable terms, collateral requirements and our operating or financial flexibility could all be negatively affected, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants.  Our operations may also be impacted by regulations affecting capital flows, financial markets or financial institutions, which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs. If any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  Trading volatility and price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors.  Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these factors, some of which are outside our control, are the following:  ##TABLE_START  The continuing unpredictable global economic and market conditions;  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the United States, which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business;  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can be affected by market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete); unauthorized disclosures about our performance, plans or expectations about our business; our actual performance and creditworthiness; investor confidence, driven in part by expectations about our ##TABLE_END McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 7 performance; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonalds may be included, such as the SP 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average;  ##TABLE_START  The impact of our stock repurchase program or dividend rate; and  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact on our results of corporate actions and market and third-party perceptions and assessments of such actions, such as those we may take from time to time as we implement our strategies in light of changing business, legal and tax considerations and evolve our corporate structure.  ##TABLE_END Our results and prospects can be adversely affected by events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others.  Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels and supply availability and costs, as well as the local operations in impacted markets, all of which can affect our results and prospects. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses fully.  ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments  ##TABLE_ENDNone. ##TABLE_START ", "2": " ITEM 2. Properties  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company owns and leases real estate primarily in connection with its restaurant business. The Company identifies and develops sites that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential to the Company. To assess potential, the Company analyzes traffic and walking patterns, census data and other relevant data. The Companys experience and access to advanced technology aid in evaluating this information. The Company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for conventional franchised and Company-operated restaurant sites, which ensures long-term occupancy rights and helps control related costs. Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to control average development costs through construction and design efficiencies, standardization and by leveraging the Companys global sourcing network. Additional information about the Companys properties is included in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7, pages 13 through 27  and in Financial statements and supplementary data in Part II, Item 8, pages 28 through 47 of this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START ", "3": " ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company has pending a number of lawsuits that have been filed in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover a broad variety of allegations spanning the Companys entire business. The following is a brief description of the more significant types of claims and lawsuits. In addition, the Company is subject to various national and local laws and regulations that impact various aspects of its business, as discussed below. While the Company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, unfavorable rulings could occur. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on net income for the period in which the ruling occurs or for future periods. ##TABLE_START  Franchising ##TABLE_END A substantial number of McDonalds restaurants are franchised to independent owner/operators under contractual arrangements with the Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company and its current or former franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects including, but not limited to, quality, service and cleanliness issues, menu pricing, contentions regarding grants or terminations of franchises, delinquent payments of rents and fees, and franchisee claims for additional franchises or rewrites of franchises. Additionally, occasional disputes arise between the Company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a McDonalds franchise or who challenge the legal distinction between the Company and its franchisees for employment law purposes. ##TABLE_START  Suppliers ##TABLE_END The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries generally do not supply food, paper or related items to any McDonalds restaurants. The Company relies upon numerous independent suppliers, including service providers, that are required to meet and maintain the Companys high standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company and its suppliers (or former suppliers) which include, for example, compliance with product specifications and the Companys business relationship with suppliers. In addition, disputes occasionally arise on a number of issues between the Company and individuals or entities who claim that they should be (or should have been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the Companys restaurants. ##TABLE_START  Employees ##TABLE_END Hundreds of thousands of people are employed by the Company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, thousands of people from time to time seek employment in such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes arise regarding hiring, termination, promotion and pay practices, including wage and hour disputes, alleged discrimination and compliance with labor and employment laws. ##TABLE_START  Customers ##TABLE_END Restaurants owned by subsidiaries of the Company regularly serve a broad segment of the public. In so doing, disputes arise as to products, service, incidents, advertising, nutritional and other disclosures, as well as other matters common to an extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company. ##TABLE_START  Intellectual Property ##TABLE_END The Company has registered trademarks and service marks, patents and copyrights, some of which are of material importance to the Companys business. From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation to protect its intellectual property and defend against the alleged use of third party intellectual property.  ##TABLE_START  Government Regulations ##TABLE_END Local and national governments have adopted laws and regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business including, but not limited to, advertising, franchising, health, safety, environment, zoning, employment and taxation.

Given the Companys returns on incremental invested capital and assets, management believes it is prudent to reinvest in the business in markets with acceptable returns and/or opportunity for long-term growth and use excess cash flow to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The Company has paid dividends on common stock for 41 consecutive years through 2016 and has increased the dividend amount at least once every year. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors.

McDonald's is included in published restaurant indices; however, unlike most other companies included in these indices, which have no or limited international operations, McDonald's does business in more than 100 countries and a substantial portion of our revenues and income is generated outside the U.S. In addition, because of our size, McDonald's inclusion in those indices tends to skew the results. Therefore, we believe that such a comparison is not meaningful. Our market capitalization, trading volume and importance in an industry that is vital to the U.S. economy have resulted in McDonald's inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) since 1985. Like McDonald's, many DJIA companies generate meaningful revenues and income outside the U.S. and some manage global brands. Thus, we believe that the use of the DJIA companies as the group for comparison purposes is appropriate. The following performance graph shows McDonald's cumulative total shareholder returns (i.e., price appreciation and reinvestment of dividends) relative to the Standard  Poor's 500 Stock Index (SP 500 Index) and to the DJIA companies for the five-year period ended December 31, 2016 . The graph assumes that the value of an investment in McDonald's common stock, the SP 500 Index and the DJIA companies (including McDonald's) was $100 at December 31, 2011 .

Franchised restaurants represent approximately 85% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide at December 31, 2016. ##TABLE_END12 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report ##TABLE_START ", "7": " ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  ##TABLE_ENDOverview DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants. Of the 36,899 restaurants in 120 countries at year-end 2016 , 31,230 were franchised (reflects 21,559 franchised to conventional franchisees, 6,300 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,371 licensed to foreign affiliates (\"affiliates\")primarily Japan) and 5,669 were operated by the Company. Under McDonald's conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and dcor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees enabling restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in the reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants in an effort to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives. Under McDonald's developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company generally has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market. McDonald's is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. Franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment-related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the financial strength and global experience of McDonald's. However, directly operating restaurants is important to being a credible franchisor and provides Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, McDonald's further develops and refines operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that the Company believes are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. McDonald's continually reviews its mix of Company-operated and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be approximately 95% franchised over the long term. The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The business is structured into the following segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth, and reflect how management reviews and evaluates operating performance: ##TABLE_START  U.S. - the Company's largest segment. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  International Lead Markets - established markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the U.K. and related markets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  High Growth Markets - markets that the Company believes have relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential including China, Italy, Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, Switzerland and related markets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Foundational Markets  Corporate - the remaining markets in the McDonald's system, each of which the Company believes have the potential to operate under a largely franchised model. Corporate activities are also reported within this segment. ##TABLE_END For the year ended December 31, 2016 , the U.S., International Lead Markets and High Growth Markets accounted for 34% , 29% and 25% of total revenues, respectively. In analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures which are considered to be non-GAAP, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, return on incremental invested capital (\"ROIIC\"), free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below. ##TABLE_START  Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases most incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents its underlying business trends. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the Companys initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Typically, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. The goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Companys financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average ##TABLE_END McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 13 foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. ##TABLE_START  Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Companys ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. ##TABLE_END STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE  The strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the \"System\") is key to McDonald's long-term success. By leveraging the System, McDonalds is able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. McDonald's continually builds on its competitive advantages of System alignment and geographic diversification to deliver consistent, yet locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers as an integral part of their communities. PROGRESS ON THE COMPANY'S TURNAROUND The turnaround plan, introduced in 2015, represented a significant step change in how McDonald's operates and a recommitment to putting customers first. With an aspiration of being recognized by customers as a modern and progressive burger company, the Company prioritized fewer, more strategic initiatives that focused on running better restaurants, driving operational growth, returning excitement to the brand and enhancing financial value.  Building on these initial steps, the Company made purposeful changes in 2016. The Company continued to right-size the organization and put the appropriate talent in place by blending executives with deep McDonalds experience with new executives to generate fresh energy and innovative ideas, while successfully executing against the key elements of its turnaround plan. As reflected by improved customer satisfaction measures across most of the major markets, customers have taken notice. In addition to the customer-relevant changes in the restaurants, the Company has enhanced financial value through its refranchising efforts, cost savings initiatives and cash return to shareholders, as follows: ##TABLE_START  Refranchising - the Company expects to achieve its refranchising target of 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2017, a full year ahead of the original target date, with a long-term goal to become approximately 95% franchised. Since 2015, the Company has pursued its refranchising goal through the expansion of its conventional franchisee base and the addition of new developmental licensees that bring strong strategic capabilities and financial resources that will enable accelerated expansion and innovation. ##TABLE_END Moving to a more heavily franchised business model will benefit the Companys performance over the long term, as the rent and royalty income received from franchisees will provide a more predictable and stable revenue stream with significantly lower operating costs and risks. This model is less capital intensive as franchisees are responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses. ##TABLE_START  Cost Savings - the Company made meaningful progress towards its goal of reducing net GA levels by $500 million by the end of 2018 from the Companys GA base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. Actions taken in 2015 and 2016, including the redesign of the organization to eliminate layers and increase spans of control, more centralization of non-customer facing business processes and execution ##TABLE_ENDagainst its refranchising targets, have resulted in savings of more than $200 million. ##TABLE_START  Cash Return to Shareholders - The strength and reliability of the Company's significant and growing free cash flow, strong investment grade credit rating and continued access to credit provide the flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders. By the end of 2016, the Company achieved its three-year target of $30 billion cash return to shareholders. Optimization of the Company's capital structure by adding a meaningful amount of additional debt was instrumental in meeting this target. ##TABLE_END 2016 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The Company's progress in executing the turnaround plan is evident by its stronger business results, including the highest comparable sales growth since 2011. In McDonalds heavily franchised business model, growing comparable sales is key to increasing operating income and returns. In 2016, global comparable sales increased 3.8%, including positive comparable sales across all segments. Comparable guest counts were negative 0.3%, as positive guest traffic in the Foundational Markets and International Lead Markets was more than offset by negative guest traffic in the U.S. and High Growth Markets. ##TABLE_START  Comparable sales in the U.S. increased 1.7%, due in part to a higher average check, while comparable guest counts declined 2.1% amidst continued industry softness. The growth in comparable sales was supported by All-Day Breakfast and everyday value under the McPick 2 platform. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Comparable sales in the International Lead Markets increased 3.4% and comparable guest counts increased 1.5%, reflecting solid comparable sales performance across most of the segment, led by the U.K. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In the High Growth Markets, comparable sales increased 2.8%, while comparable guest counts declined 0.8%. The increase in comparable sales reflected positive results across most of the segment, led by China. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Comparable sales in the Foundational Markets increased 10.0% and comparable guest counts increased 1.9%, led by very strong performance in Japan and certain markets in Latin America, as well as solid results across the remainder of the segment. ##TABLE_END In addition to improved comparable sales performance, the Company achieved the following financial results in 2016: ##TABLE_START  Consolidated revenues decreased  3% (flat in constant currencies) due to the impact of refranchising, partly offset by positive comparable sales. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Systemwide sales increased  3% ( 5% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consolidated operating income increased  8% ( 11% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating margin, defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues, increased from 28.1% in 2015 to 31.5% in 2016. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted earnings per share of $5.44  increased  13% ( 16% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash provided by operations was $6.1 billion . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Capital expenditures of $1.8 billion were allocated mainly to reinvestment in existing restaurants and, to a lesser extent, to new restaurant openings. Across the System, about 900 ##TABLE_END14 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report restaurants were opened and over 1,700 existing locations were reimaged. ##TABLE_START  Free cash flow was $4.2 billion and the Company's free cash flow conversion rate was 90% (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  One-year ROIIC was 62.7% and three-year ROIIC was 5.1% for the period ended December 31, 2016  (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company increased its quarterly cash dividend per share by 6% to $0.94 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $3.76 per share. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company returned $14.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases for the year, achieving the Company's targeted return of $30 billion for the three-year period ended 2016. ##TABLE_END STRATEGIC DIRECTION Building on the momentum established in 2016, the Company is beginning to shift focus from revitalizing the business to longer-term growth. The Company will move with increased velocity to drive sustainable guest count growth, a reliable long-term measure of the Company's strength that is vital to growing the Companys sales and shareholder value. In order to drive guest count growth in an ever-changing customer environment, the Company developed a customer-centric growth strategy for 2017 and beyond, informed by deep customer research across multiple markets. The Company's greatest opportunities are at the heart of the brand - in its food, value and customer experience - and within defined customer groups. This strategy is built on the following three pillars, which will position McDonald's as a modern and progressive burger company that \"makes delicious, feel good moments easy for everyone.\" ##TABLE_START  Retaining existing customers . The Company will renew its focus on areas where the Company already has a strong foothold in the IEO, including family occasions and food-led breakfast. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Regaining lost customers. The Company plans to regain customers by recommitting to areas of historic strength, namely quality, convenience and value. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Converting casual to committed customers. The Company will focus on building stronger relationships with customers so they visit more often, by elevating and leveraging the McCaf coffee brand and enhancing snack and treat offerings. ##TABLE_END The Company will continue to build upon its investments in Experience of the Future (\"EOTF\"), which focuses on restaurant modernization and technology, in order to transform the restaurant service experience. The Company is also accelerating its pursuit of the following two initiatives designed to further drive growth. ##TABLE_START  Digital . As the Company accelerates its pace of converting restaurants to EOTF, it is placing renewed emphasis on improving its existing service model (i.e., eat in, take out, or drive-thru) and strengthening its relationships with customers through technology. By evolving the technology platform, the Company will simplify how customers order, pay and are served through additional functionality on its global mobile app, self-order kiosks and technology-driven models that enable table service and curb-side pick-up. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Delivery. The Company is accelerating its focus and investment on its delivery platform as a way to expand the convenience customers expect from McDonald's. The ##TABLE_ENDCompany is conducting various pilot tests in the U.S., Europe and Asia and plans to scale quickly based on results of these pilots. AREAS OF FOCUS BY SEGMENT U.S. While the U.S. has begun to build sales momentum, its greatest opportunity is guest count growth, by focusing on actions that collectively transform the customer experience. A focus on food taste and quality will remain a key priority, including offering the Company's best tasting burger. In 2017, the U.S. is planning to introduce its Signature Crafted offering, a premium platform focused on authentic ingredients that allows customers to customize their sandwiches. In addition, the U.S. will remain focused on strengthening its customer-relevant value proposition. The U.S. expects to launch its mobile order and pay functionality as well as curbside pick-up across all traditional restaurants in the fourth quarter 2017. Further, most of the System's traditional restaurants are expected to be converted to EOTF by 2020. In addition, the U.S. will continue to test its delivery platform. International Lead Markets The International Lead Markets are deepening their connection with customers and meeting their changing needs with meaningful enhancements in menu, accessibility and experience. The segment is focused on providing quality, great taste, value and choice across the entire menu. Entry-level value programs appeal to teens and young adults, while other platforms provide budget-conscious customers affordable meal bundles. Programs across the segment are energizing the core menu, and every market has successfully extended into premium chicken and beef with locally relevant offerings. All of this is supported by modernized cooking and service platforms that expand capacity and enable hotter, fresher products. The segment will also remain focused on enhancing and expanding the McCaf coffee brand and pastry offerings.  The International Lead Markets continues to lead the McDonalds System in the development and deployment of EOTF. High Growth Markets McDonalds High Growth Markets have leveraged learnings from the International Lead Markets to enhance the customer experience through design, digital, people, menu innovation and value. In addition to driving operational growth in existing restaurants, targeted new restaurant development and refranchising initiatives are top priorities. In early 2017, the Company announced the planned sale of its businesses in China and Hong Kong to a developmental licensee. Foundational Markets The Foundational Markets is a diverse group of markets that share common goals of enhancing the critical elements that differentiate McDonalds - the menu and the customer experience. The segment is committed to running great restaurants and increasing convenience to customers, including through drive-thru and delivery. The Foundational Markets continue to pursue refranchising opportunities, including the sale of certain markets to developmental licensees. In early 2017, the Company announced the planned sale of its businesses in the Nordic markets (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) to a developmental licensee.  McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 15 OUTLOOK 2017 Outlook The following global and certain segment-specific information is provided to assist in forecasting the Companys future results . ##TABLE_START  Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1 percentage point to 2017 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies).  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the U.S. or the International Lead segment would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 4 to 5 cents.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  With about 75% of McDonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company's commodity costs. For the full-year 2017, costs for the total basket of goods are expected to increase about 0.5-1.5% in the U.S. and increase about 2.0% in the International Lead segment.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects full-year 2017 selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease about 7-8%, in constant currencies with fluctuations expected between the quarters. This includes incentive-based compensation costs of less than $300 million.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full-year 2017 to increase about 5-10% compared with 2016 due to higher average debt balances.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  A significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 35% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 25 cents.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2017 to be in the 31-33% range. Some volatility may result in a quarterly tax rate outside of the annual range.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects capital expenditures for 2017 to be approximately $1.7 billion, about one-third of which will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open about 900 restaurants, including about 500 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets where the Company generally does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of about 400 restaurants. The remaining two-thirds of capital will be used to reinvest in existing locations, including about 650 reimages in the U.S. When combined with previously modernized restaurants that will be updated with EOTF elements in 2017, we expect to have about 2,500 EOTF restaurants in the U.S. by the end of 2017. ##TABLE_ENDLong-Term Outlook ##TABLE_START  The Company expects to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants in the three-year period ending 2017, with a long-term goal to become approximately 95% franchised. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects to realize net annual GA savings of about $500 million from its GA base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. Through the end of 2016, the Company realized cumulative savings of more than $200 million and expects to realize the majority of its savings target by the end of 2017. Beyond its $500 million reduction, the Company expects to further reduce GA by 5-10% from the remaining GA base by the end of 2019. These targets exclude the impact of foreign currency changes.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects capital expenditures to decline by approximately $500 million from the 2017 level of $1.7 billion, once the U.S. restaurant modernization work is substantially completed. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects to return between $22 and $24 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2019. This new target contemplates proceeds from future restaurant sales expected under its ongoing refranchising initiative. As the business grows, the Company also expects to modestly increase its debt levels, while maintaining its credit metrics within current ranges.  ##TABLE_END Long-Term Financial Targets The Company has established the following long-term, average annual (constant currency) financial targets, beginning in 2019, with variability expected during 2017 and 2018 due to the impact of refranchising: ##TABLE_START  Systemwide sales growth of 3-5%; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating margin in the mid-40% range; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Earnings per share growth in the high-single digits; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ROIIC in the mid-20% range. ##TABLE_END 16 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report Consolidated Operating Results ##TABLE_START Operating results           Dollars and shares in millions, except per share data  Amount  Increase/ (decrease)   Amount  Increase/ (decrease)   Amount Revenues             Sales by Company-operated restaurants  $ 15,295  (7 %)   $ 16,488  (9 %)   $ 18,169 Revenues from franchised restaurants  9,327    8,925  (4 )   9,272 Total revenues  24,622  (3 )   25,413  (7 )   27,441 Operating costs and expenses             Company-operated restaurant expenses  12,699  (9 )   13,977  (9 )   15,288 Franchised restaurants-occupancy expenses  1,718    1,647  (3 )   1,697 Selling, general  administrative expenses  2,384  (2 )   2,434  (2 )   2,488 Other operating (income) expense, net   (64 )    n/m   Total operating costs and expenses  16,877 (8 )   18,267  (6 )   19,492 Operating income  7,745    7,146  (10 )   7,949 Interest expense        Nonoperating (income) expense, net  (6 )    (48 )  n/m   Income before provision for income taxes  6,866    6,556  (11 )   7,372 Provision for income taxes  2,180    2,027  (22 )   2,614 Net income  $ 4,686  %   $ 4,529  (5 %)   $ 4,758 Earnings per common sharediluted  $ 5.44  %   $ 4.80  %   $ 4.82 Weighted-average common shares outstanding diluted  861.2  (9 %)   944.6  (4 %)   986.3 ##TABLE_ENDn/m Not meaningful IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonalds mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing goods and services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results in each of the last three years. In 2016, results were negatively impacted by the weaker British Pound as well as many other currencies. In 2015, results were negatively impacted by the weaker Euro, Australian Dollar, Russian Ruble and most other currencies.  In 2014, results were negatively impacted by the weaker Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar and certain other currencies, partly offset by the stronger British Pound.

Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.11 on diluted earnings per share. In 2015 , net income decreased 5% (increased 5% in constant currencies) to $4.5 billion and diluted earnings per common share was relatively flat (increased 10% in constant currencies) at $4.80 . Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.50 on diluted earnings per share. Results in 2016 benefited from stronger operating performance and higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses, mostly in the U.S., while results in 2015 benefited from higher franchised margins and a gain on the strategic sale of a unique restaurant property in the U.S. Both 2016 and 2015 results were partly offset by net pre-tax impairment and other charges of $342 million and $307 million, respectively, primarily related to goodwill impairment and other asset write-offs in conjunction with the Company's refranchising initiatives, restructuring and incremental restaurant closings. The 2015 charges combined with the gain on the strategic sale of a unique restaurant property in the U.S. had a net negative impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.18 in 2015, while the 2016 charges had a net negative impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.28 in 2016. The Company repurchased 92.3 million shares of its stock for $11.1 billion in 2016 and 61.8 million shares of its stock for $6.2 billion in 2015 , driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share.  McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 17 REVENUES The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company continues to accelerate the pace of refranchising to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams, and operate with a less resource-intensive structure. The shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales are replaced by franchised sales, where the Company receives rent and/or royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales. In 2016 , revenues decreased 3% (flat in constant currencies) due to the impact of refranchising, partly offset by positive comparable sales. In 2015, revenues decreased 7% (increased 3% in constant currencies), partly due to foreign currency translation. In constant currencies, revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales and the benefit from expansion. ##TABLE_START Revenues   Amount   Increase/(decrease)   Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation  Dollars in millions        Company-operated sales:               U.S.  $ 3,743  $ 4,198  $ 4,351  (11 %)  (4 %)  (11 %)  (4 %) International Lead Markets  4,278  4,798  5,443  (11 )  (12 )  (6 )  High Growth Markets  5,378  5,442  6,071  (1 )  (10 )   Foundational Markets  Corporate  1,896  2,050  2,304  (8 )  (11 )  (5 )  Total  $ 15,295  $ 16,488  $ 18,169  (7 %)  (9 %)  (4 %)  % Franchised revenues:               U.S.  $ 4,510  $ 4,361  $ 4,300  %  %  %  % International Lead Markets  2,945  2,817  3,101   (9 )   High Growth Markets      (5 )   Foundational Markets  Corporate  1,089  1,016  1,097   (7 )   Total  $ 9,327  $ 8,925  $ 9,272  %  (4 %)  %  % Total revenues:               U.S.  $ 8,253  $ 8,559  $ 8,651  (4 %)  (1 %)  (4 %)  (1 %) International Lead Markets  7,223  7,615  8,544  (5 )  (11 )  (1 )  High Growth Markets  6,161  6,173  6,845   (10 )   Foundational Markets  Corporate  2,985  3,066  3,401  (3 )  (10 )   Total  $ 24,622  $ 25,413  $ 27,441  (3 %)  (7 %)  %  %                ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  US: In 2016 , the decrease in revenues reflected the impact of refranchising, partly offset by modestly positive comparable sales.

Franchised margin dollars represented about 75% of the combined restaurant margins in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . In 2016 , franchised margin dollars increased  $331 million or 5% ( 6% in constant currencies). In 2015 , franchised margin dollars decreased $297 million or 4% (increased 4% in constant currencies), due to foreign currency translation. For both 2016 and 2015, the constant currency increases were due to positive comparable sales performance, expansion and refranchising. In connection with the Company's refranchising initiatives, the Company expects to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants for the three-year period ending 2017. While this refranchising activity may have a dilutive effect on the franchised margin percent, it typically results in higher franchised margin dollars.

In 2015 , the slight decrease reflected the benefit from positive comparable sales performance and the negative impact from higher occupancy costs and refranchising. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  High Growth Markets: In 2016 , the decrease in the franchised margin percent was primarily due to the impact of refranchising and higher occupancy costs, partly offset by the benefit of positive comparable sales performance. In 2015 , the decrease was primarily due to the impact of refranchising. ##TABLE_END The franchised margin percent in Foundational Markets  Corporate is higher relative to the other segments due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. COMPANY-OPERATED MARGINS Company-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. In 2 016,  Company-operated margin dollars increased $ 85 million or 3% ( 7% in constant currencies).

In 2015, the margin percent also benefited from refranchising efforts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  High Growth Markets: In 2016, the increase in the Company-operated margin percent was primarily due to positive comparable sales and improved restaurant profitability in China, which benefited from recent value-added tax (\"VAT\") reform, partly offset by higher labor costs across the segment. In 2015, the decrease was primarily due to the negative impact from currency and inflationary pressures in Russia, and higher labor and occupancy costs across the segment. This was partly offset by the benefit from recovery in China from a 2014 supplier issue. ##TABLE_END20 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report SELLING, GENERAL  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses decreased  2% ( 1% in constant currencies) in 2016 and decreased 2% (increased 4% in constant currencies) in 2015 . The decrease in 2016 was due to lower employee-related costs resulting from the Company's recent restructuring and other cost-saving initiatives, mostly offset by higher incentive-based compensation expenses reflecting improved Company performance. The decrease in 2015 benefited from foreign currency translation. In constant currencies, selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to higher incentive-based compensation costs reflecting improved performance, partly offset by lower employee-related costs resulting from the Company's restructuring initiatives.

Management believes that analyzing selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall McDonald's business. In connection with our turnaround plan, the Company established a net selling, general and administrative savings target of $500 million to be achieved by the end of 2018, excluding the effects of any foreign currency changes. These savings represent a reduction of about 20% from our selling, general and administrative base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. This base included incentive-based compensation of approximately $330 million, which assumed achievement of planned operating performance. In 2014, the lower incentive-based compensation reflected nominal payouts for the Company's short-term cash bonus program. ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_ENDOTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET Other operating (income) expense, net ##TABLE_START In millions   Gains on sales of restaurant businesses $ (283 )  $ (146 )  $ (137 ) Equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates (55 )   Asset dispositions and other (income) expense, net  (27 )  Impairment and other charges (gains), net   Total $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Gains on sales of restaurant businesses ##TABLE_END In 2016, the Company realized higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses, primarily in the U.S. ##TABLE_START  Equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates ##TABLE_END Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased in 2016 mainly due to improved performance in Japan.

In 2015, the increase was primarily due to the aforementioned gain on sale of property and higher franchised margin dollars, partly offset by lower Company-operated margin dollars reflecting higher costs associated with the incremental investment in wages and benefits for eligible Company-operated restaurant employees, effective July 1, 2015. In addition, 2015 results were negatively impacted by restructuring and restaurant closing charges. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  International Lead Markets: In 2016, the constant currency operating income increase was primarily due to sales-driven improvements in franchised margin dollars across most markets.

In 2014, the higher effective income tax rate was primarily due to a change in tax reserves for 2003-2010 resulting from an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction, as well as the impact of changes in tax reserves related to audit progression in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions. These items had a negative impact of 4.1% on the effective tax rate. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $2.0 billion in 2016 and $1.8 billion  in 2015 . Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Recently issued accounting standards are included in Part II, Item 8, page  34 of this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START Cash Flows  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $6.1 billion and free cash flow was $4.2 billion in 2016, while cash provided by operations totaled $6.5 billion and free cash flow was $4.7 billion in 2015. In 2016, cash provided by operations decreased $480 million or 7% compared with 2015, primarily due to higher income tax payments primarily outside the U.S. and other working capital changes, partly offset by higher net income. In 2015, cash provided by operations decreased $191 million or 3% compared with 2014 primarily due to lower operating results, including the impact from weaker foreign currencies, and other operating activity, partly offset by changes in working capital. Cash used for investing activities totaled $982 million in 2016, a decrease of $438 million compared with 2015. The decrease primarily reflected higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.4 billion in 2015, a decrease of $885 million compared with 2014. The decrease primarily reflected lower capital expenditures. Cash used for financing activities totaled $11.3 billion in 2016, an increase of $12.0 billion compared with 2015, primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings and higher treasury stock purchases. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $735 million in 2015, an increase of $5.4 billion compared with 2014, primarily due to an increase in net borrowings, partly offset by higher treasury stock purchases. The Companys cash and equivalents balance was $1.2 billion and $7.7 billion at year end 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was mostly due to higher net borrowings in 2015 that were used for share repurchases in 2016. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In 2016 , the Company opened 896 restaurants and closed 522 restaurants. In 2015 , the Company opened 989 restaurants and closed 722 restaurants. The increase in restaurant closings in 2015 reflected a strategic review that resulted in additional closures of under-performing restaurants. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.

Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $3.4 million in 2016 . The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2016 and 2015 . SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS In 2016, the Company returned $14.2 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid, marking the achievement of the Company's targeted return of $30 billion for the three-year period ended 2016.

In 2016, approximately 92.3 million shares were repurchased for $11.1 billion under the program. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 41 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2016 full year dividend of $ 3.61 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.89 per share, with an increase to $0.94 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 6% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $3.76 per share annual dividend and reflects the Companys confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors. ##TABLE_START Financial Position and Capital Resources  ##TABLE_ENDTOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS Total assets decreased $6.9 billion or 18% in 2016 primarily due to lower cash and equivalents. Nearly 85% of total assets were in the U.S., International Lead markets and High Growth markets at year-end 2016. Net property and equipment decreased $1.9 billion in 2016, primarily due to the impact of depreciation and the reclass of the assets of China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan markets to assets of businesses held for sale, partly offset by capital expenditures. Net property and equipment represented about 70% of total assets at year end. Operating income and month-end asset balances are used to compute return on average assets. For the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014, return on average assets was 23.0%, 20.9% and 21.8%, respectively. In 2016, return on average assets increased due to higher operating income and lower average assets. In 2015, return on average assets decreased primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation on operating income, partly offset by lower average assets. Operating income does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about three percentage points for all years presented. FINANCING AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2016 totaled $26.0 billion, compared with $24.1 billion at December 31, 2015. The net increase in 2016 was primarily due to net long-term issuances of $2.7 billion.

To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Under existing authorization from the Companys Board of Directors, at December 31, 2016 , the Company had $15.0 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $2.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2017 is $1.6 billion of long-term corporate debt. The Company plans to issue long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. As of December 31, 2016 , the Company's subsidiaries also had $489 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements, of which $297 million is classified in Liabilities of businesses held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $8.9 billion and $7.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Companys restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2016 , the Company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to negative fair value of certain 24 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report derivative positions. The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions. The Companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures ##TABLE_START In millions of U.S. Dollars  Euro $ 1,968  $ 3,974 British Pounds Sterling 1,340  1,333 Australian Dollars 1,393  1,316 Canadian Dollars 1,190  1,096 Japanese Yen  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2016 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2016 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. LIQUIDITY The Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where we earn about 60% of our operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. Accordingly, no U.S. federal or state income taxes have been provided on these undistributed foreign earnings. The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $663 million as of December 31, 2016 . We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds. Consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities. In the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future. While the likelihood is remote, to the extent foreign cash is available, the Company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits), which could result in a use of cash. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. Refer to the Income Taxes note to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Companys borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2016 . See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details. ##TABLE_START  Contractual cash outflows   Contractual cash inflows  In millions Operating leases (1)   Debt obligations (2)   Minimum rent under franchise arrangements (3)   $ 1,303   $   $ 2,690  1,200   1,756   2,617  1,103   3,933   2,540  1,001   2,396   2,426    1,555   2,295 Thereafter  6,754   16,349   18,764 Total  $ 12,253   $ 26,066   $ 31,332 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Includes future minimum lease payments for businesses in markets considered held for sale as of the date of the Company's filing of this report on Form 10-K.

These rent payments per year (in millions) are as follows: 2017- $91.8; 2018- $90.6; 2019- $87.2; 2020- $84.5; 2021- $81.3; Thereafter- $589.2. ##TABLE_END In the U.S., the Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") limitations. At December 31, 2016 , total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $465 million . In addition, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $924 million at December 31, 2016 . There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business, and timing of such payments are not  McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 25 estimable or determinable. The amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the Companys financial position. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows. ##TABLE_START Other Matters  ##TABLE_ENDCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: ##TABLE_START  Property and equipment ##TABLE_END Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. ##TABLE_START  Businesses Held for Sale ##TABLE_END Assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet primarily consist of balances related to businesses in China and Hong Kong. In December 2016, the Companys Board of Directors approved an agreement for the Company to sell its existing businesses in China and Hong Kong, which comprise over 2,600 restaurants, to a developmental licensee organization. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will retain a 20% ownership in the business. The Company expects to complete the sale and licensing transaction mid-year 2017, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of any regulatory approvals. Based on approval by the Board of Directors, the Company concluded that these markets were held for sale as of December 31, 2016 in accordance with the requirements of ASC 360 Property, Plant and Equipment. Accordingly, the Company has ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to the assets of the China and Hong Kong markets effective January 1, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, total assets relating to businesses in China and Hong Kong were $1.3 billion, of which $217 million was current, and total liabilities were $592 million, most of which was current. As a result of this sale, the Company expects to record a gain of approximately $700-$900 million reflecting the difference between the net book value of the businesses and an estimated $1.5 billion of cash proceeds to be received at closing, subject to adjustments. ##TABLE_START  Share-based compensation ##TABLE_END The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Companys stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. ##TABLE_START  Long-lived assets impairment review ##TABLE_END Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Companys experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Companys estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, approximately 5-10% of goodwill may be at risk of future impairment as the fair values of certain reporting units were not substantially in excess of their carrying amounts. ##TABLE_START  Litigation accruals ##TABLE_END In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 26 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report ##TABLE_START  Income taxes ##TABLE_END The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. In 2016, the Company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior years by $150 million. In 2015, the Company decreased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to settlements with taxing authorities by $258 million. See the Income Taxes footnote in the consolidated financial statements for the related tax reconciliations. The most significant new developments in 2015 and 2016 are described below. In 2015, the Company received an unfavorable decision related to its procedural efforts to appeal a prior year unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction related to exempt income matters. As a result of this new information, the Company agreed to settle the issue for 2003-2008 with the tax authorities and the unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by $143 million. No cash payment was made related to this settlement in 2015 as the Company had previously made a payment to the taxing authority. The settlement did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows, results of operations or financial position. In 2016, the unrecognized tax benefits related to this issue for 2009-2010 were reduced by $57 million as a result of the lapsing of the statute of limitations. In 2015, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a Revenue Agent Report for certain agreed adjustments related to the Companys U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010 and the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was reduced by $102 million. Also in 2015, the Company filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office related to certain disagreed transfer pricing matters related to the Companys U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had not yet received a response to this protest from the IRS. The Company expects resolution on these issues in either 2017 or 2018. In addition, the Company's 2011 and 2012 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the field audit is expected in 2017. In 2016, the Company received new information during the progression of tax audits in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions. As a result of this new information, the Company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $125 million. In December 2015, the European Commission opened a formal investigation directly with the Luxembourg government to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If this matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and the Company may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. As of December 31, 2016, no decision has been published with respect to this investigation. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with Topic 740 - Income Taxes of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $16.0 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management's intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICESINFLATION The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.

McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 33 ##TABLE_START Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  ##TABLE_ENDSummary of Significant Accounting Policies NATURE OF BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants in the global restaurant industry. All restaurants are operated either by the Company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchise arrangements, and foreign affiliates and developmental licensees under license agreements. The following table presents restaurant information by ownership type: ##TABLE_START Restaurants at December 31,   Conventional franchised 21,559  21,147  20,774 Developmental licensed 6,300  5,529  5,228 Foreign affiliated 3,371  3,405  3,542 Franchised 31,230  30,081  29,544 Company-operated 5,669  6,444  6,714 Systemwide restaurants 36,899  36,525  36,258 ##TABLE_ENDThe results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees were not material either individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale. CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily McDonalds Japan) are accounted for by the equity method. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers, and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the variable interest entity consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented. ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The goal of this update is to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09 in the second quarter 2016, which required reflecting any adjustments as of January 1, 2016. The primary impact of adoption was the recognition of excess tax benefits as a reduction to the provision for income taxes. Additional amendments to ASU 2016-09 related to income taxes and minimum statutory withholding tax requirements had no impact to retained earnings, where the cumulative effect of these changes are required to be recorded. The Company also elected to continue estimating forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period. The presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits were applied prospectively; as such, prior years have not been restated. The presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of the periods presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows, since such cash flows have historically been presented in financing activities. Lease Accounting In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company anticipates ASU 2016-02 to have a material impact on the consolidated balance sheet. Upon adoption, a portion of our franchise related revenue may be subject to the allocation provisions outlined in ASU 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\". We are currently evaluating the specific implementation requirements, if any, for allocating consideration within our lessor contracts in accordance with ASU 2014-09. The impact of ASU 2016-02 is non-cash in nature, as such, it will not affect the Companys cash flows. Income Taxes In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. The goal of this update is to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. The Company anticipates that ASU 2016-16 may have a material impact on the Companys consolidated balance sheet, but little to no impact on the consolidated statement of income or the Companys cash flows. Business Combinations In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-1, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, to clarify the definition of a business to assist organizations with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2017-1 in the fourth quarter 2016. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and foreign affiliates. Sales by Company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis. The Company presents sales net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and may include initial fees. Continuing rent and royalties are recognized in the period earned. Initial fees are recognized upon opening of a restaurant or granting of a new franchise term, which is when the Company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise arrangement. 34 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance codified in the Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, \"Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" which amends the guidance in former ASC 605, \"Revenue Recognition\". The core principal of the standard is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received for those goods or services. The standard also calls for additional disclosures around the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption (\"modified retrospective method\"). The Company currently expects to apply the modified retrospective transition method upon adoption. The Company does not believe the standard will impact its recognition of revenue from company-operated restaurants or its recognition of royalties from restaurants operated by franchisees or licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees, which are based on a percent of sales. While we continue to assess the potential impacts to other less significant revenue transactions, we currently believe the standard will change the way initial fees from franchisees for new restaurant openings or new franchise terms are recognized. As noted above, the Company's current accounting policy is to recognize initial franchise fees when \"earned\" per the contract terms, which is currently when a new store opens or at the start of a new franchise term. In accordance with the new guidance, the initial franchise services are not distinct from the continuing rights or services offered during the term of the franchise agreement, and will therefore be treated as a single performance obligation. As such, initial fees received will likely be recognized over the franchise term. We do not anticipate this impact to be material to the Companys consolidated statement of income, and the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded as deferred revenue upon adoption is expected to be approximately 2% of the Company's consolidated long-term liabilities. No impact to the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows is expected as the initial fees will continue to be collected upon store opening date or the beginning of a new franchise term. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842),\" a portion of our franchise related revenue may be subject to the allocation provisions outlined within the revenue recognition standard. We are currently evaluating the specific implementation requirements, if any, for allocating consideration within our lessor contracts in accordance with the revenue recognition standard. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Generally, the functional currency of operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency. ADVERTISING COSTS Advertising costs included in operating expenses of Company-operated restaurants primarily consist of contributions to advertising cooperatives and were (in millions): 2016  $645.8 ; 2015  $718.7 ; 2014  $808.2 . Production costs for radio and television advertising are expensed when the commercials are initially aired. These production costs, primarily in the U.S., as well as other marketing-related expenses included in Selling, general  administrative expenses were (in millions): 2016  $88.8 ; 2015  $113.8 ; 2014  $98.7 . Costs related to the Olympics sponsorship are included in these expenses for 2016 and 2014. In addition, significant advertising costs are incurred by franchisees through contributions to advertising cooperatives in individual markets. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Share-based compensation includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value. Share-based compensation expense and the effect on diluted earnings per common share were as follows: ##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data   Share-based compensation expense $ 131.3  $ 110.0  $ 112.8 After tax $ 89.6  $ 76.0  $ 72.8 Earnings per common share-diluted $ 0.11  $ 0.08  $ 0.08 ##TABLE_ENDCompensation expense related to share-based awards is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in Selling, general  administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2016 , there was $89.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for the 2016 , 2015 and 2014 stock option grants. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical trends. Expected stock price volatility is generally based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock for a period approximating the expected life. The expected dividend yield is based on the Companys most recent annual dividend rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life. Weighted-average assumptions ##TABLE_START  2015 Expected dividend yield 3.0 % 3.6 % 3.3 % Expected stock price volatility 19.2 % 18.8 % 20.0 % Risk-free interest rate 1.2 % 1.7 % 2.0 % Expected life of options (in years) 5.9 6.0 6.1 Fair value per option granted $ 13.65 $ 10.43 $ 12.23 ##TABLE_END McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 35 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildingsup to 40 years; leasehold improvements the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms , which generally include certain option periods; and equipment three to 12 years. BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE Assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet primarily consist of balances related to businesses in China and Hong Kong. In December 2016, the Companys Board of Directors approved an agreement for the Company to sell its existing businesses in China and Hong Kong, which comprise over 2,600 restaurants, to a developmental licensee. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will retain a 20% ownership in the business. The Company expects to complete the sale and licensing transaction mid-year 2017, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of any regulatory approvals. Based on approval by the Board of Directors, the Company concluded that these markets were held for sale as of December 31, 2016 in accordance with the requirements of ASC 360 Property, Plant and Equipment. Accordingly, the Company has ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to the assets of the China and Hong Kong markets effective January 1, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, total assets relating to businesses in China and Hong Kong were $1.3 billion , of which $217 million was current, and total liabilities were $592 million , most of which was current. As a result of this sale, the Company expects to record a gain of approximately $700 - $900 million reflecting the difference between the net book value of the businesses and an estimated $1.5 billion of cash proceeds to be received at closing, subject to adjustments. LONG-LIVED ASSETS Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing McDonalds restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together in the U.S. at a television market level, and internationally, at a country level. The Company manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurants cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows. Losses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal and the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses related to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered available for sale.\" GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurant businesses. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of McDonald's restaurants from franchisees and ownership increases in subsidiaries or affiliates, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit (defined as each individual country) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit. The following table presents the 2016 activity in goodwill by segment: ##TABLE_START In millions U.S. International Lead Markets  High Growth Markets  Foundational Markets  Corporate  Consolidated  Balance at December 31, 2015 $ 1,293.4  $ 698.1  $ 322.4  $ 202.4  $ 2,516.3 Net restaurant purchases (sales) (10.1 )  3.3  3.0  (67.1 )  (70.9 ) Impairment losses       (39.9 )  (39.9 ) Currency translation   (20.2 )  (7.7 )  (4.0 )  (31.9 ) Assets of businesses held for sale     (37.6 )  0.5  (37.1 ) Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 1,283.3  $ 681.2  $ 280.1  $ 91.9  $ 2,336.5 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company conducts goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever an indicator of impairment exists. If an indicator of impairment exists (e.g., estimated earnings multiple value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value), the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit, generally based on discounted future cash flows, with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the carrying amount of goodwill. Historically, goodwill impairment has not significantly impacted the consolidated financial statements. Accumulated impairment losses at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $96.6 million and $94.1 million , respectively. 36 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, and certain non-financial assets and liabilities on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value disclosures are reflected in a three-level hierarchy, maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: ##TABLE_START  Level 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for an identical asset or liability in an active market. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for a similar asset or liability in an active market or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END Certain of the Companys derivatives are valued using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate observable market parameters, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates, classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. Derivative valuations incorporate credit risk adjustments that are necessary to reflect the probability of default by the counterparty or the Company.  ##TABLE_START  Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value ##TABLE_END The following tables present financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the valuation hierarchy as defined in the fair value guidance:  ##TABLE_START December 31, 2016       In millions Level 1*  Level 2  Carrying Value  Derivative assets $ 134.3  $ 47.0   $ 181.3 Derivative liabilities   $ (5.6 )   $ (5.6 )         December 31, 2015       In millions Level 1*  Level 2  Carrying Value  Derivative assets $ 139.9  $ 65.4   $ 205.3 Derivative liabilities   $ (44.4 )   $ (44.4 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Level 1 is comprised of derivatives that hedge market driven changes in liabilities associated with the Companys supplemental benefit plans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis ##TABLE_END Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). For the year ended December 31, 2016 , the Company recorded fair value adjustments to its long-lived assets, primarily to goodwill, based on Level 3 inputs which includes the use of a discounted cash flow valuation approach. ##TABLE_START  Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2016 , the fair value of the Companys debt obligations was estimated at $27.5 billion , compared to a carrying amount of $26.0 billion . The fair value was based on quoted market prices, Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. The carrying amount for both cash equivalents and notes receivable approximate fair value. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt and derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of these changes. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. The Company documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions, as well as all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items. The Companys derivatives that are designated for hedge accounting consist mainly of interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, foreign currency options, and cross-currency swaps, and are classified as either fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. Further details are explained in the \"Fair Value,\" \"Cash Flow\" and \"Net Investment\" hedge sections. The Company also enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Further details are explained in the Undesignated Derivatives section. All derivatives (including those not designated for hedge accounting) are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity dates. Changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments are reflected as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") and/or current earnings.  McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 37 The following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 : ##TABLE_START  Derivative Assets  Derivative Liabilities In millions Balance Sheet Classification    Balance Sheet Classification   Derivatives designated as hedging instruments         Foreign currency Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $ 31.7  $ 55.0  Accrued payroll and other liabilities  $ (2.0 )  $ (22.5 ) Interest rate Prepaid expenses and other current assets  1.0         Foreign currency Miscellaneous other assets  2.5  0.6  Other long-term liabilities  (0.1 )  (13.0 ) Interest rate Miscellaneous other assets  1.7  5.3  Other long-term liabilities  (1.6 )  (3.4 ) Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments  $ 36.9  $ 60.9    $ (3.7 )  $ (38.9 ) Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments         Equity Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $ 134.3  $ 0.3  Accrued payroll and other liabilities  $ (1.9 )  $  Foreign currency Prepaid expenses and other current assets  10.1  4.2  Accrued payroll and other liabilities    (5.5 ) Equity Miscellaneous other assets    139.9       Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments  $ 144.4  $ 144.4    $ (1.9 )  $ (5.5 ) Total derivatives  $ 181.3  $ 205.3    $ (5.6 )  $ (44.4 ) ##TABLE_ENDFair Value Hedges The Company enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure to changes in the fair values of certain liabilities. The Company's fair value hedges convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt by use of interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2016 , $2.5 billion of the Company's outstanding fixed-rate debt was effectively converted. All of the Companys interest rate swaps meet the shortcut method requirements. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying debt. No ineffectiveness has been recorded to net income related to interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the year ended December 31, 2016 . ##TABLE_START Derivatives in Hedging Relationships  Gain (Loss) Recognized In Earnings on Hedging Derivative  Gain (Loss) Recognized In Earnings on Hedged Items   In millions       Interest rate   $ (1.8 )  $ (3.4 )   $ 1.8  $ 3.4 ##TABLE_ENDCash Flow Hedges The Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. The types of cash flow hedges the Company enters into include interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, foreign currency options and cross currency swaps. The effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives are reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company excludes the time value of foreign currency options from its effectiveness assessment. As a result, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to this component, as well as the ineffectiveness of the hedges, are recognized immediately in earnings. ##TABLE_START   Gain (Loss) Recognized in AOCI (Effective Portion)  Gain (Loss) Reclassified From AOCI Into Earnings (Effective Portion)  Gain (Loss) Recognized in Earnings (Amount Excluded from Effectiveness Testing and Ineffective Portion) Derivatives in Hedging Relationships       In millions          Foreign currency   $ 28.6  $ 35.3   $ 24.6  $ 53.0   $   $ 22.9 Interest rate (1)        (0.5 )  (0.5 )         $ 28.6  $ 35.3   $ 24.1  $ 52.5   $   $ 22.9 ##TABLE_END(1) The amount of gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI into earnings is recorded in interest expense . 38 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report The Company periodically uses interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of floating-rate debt, including forecasted debt issuances, into fixed-rate debt. The agreements are intended to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies), the Company uses foreign currency forwards and foreign currency options to hedge a portion of anticipated exposures. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the decline in value of future foreign denominated royalties is offset by gains in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards and/or foreign currency options. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in the value of future foreign denominated royalties is offset by losses in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards and/or foreign currency options. Although the fair value changes in the foreign currency options may fluctuate over the period of the contract, the Companys total loss on a foreign currency option is limited to the upfront premium paid for the contract; however, the potential gains on a foreign currency option are unlimited. The hedges cover the next 18 months for certain exposures and are denominated in various currencies. As of December 31, 2016 , the Company had derivatives outstanding with an equivalent notional amount of $632.0 million that were used to hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency denominated royalties. The Company recorded after tax adjustments to the cash flow hedging component of AOCI in shareholders equity. The Company recorded an increase of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and a decrease of $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Based on interest rates and foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2016 , there is $22.9 million in after-tax cumulative cash flow hedging gains which is not expected to have a significant effect on earnings over the next 12 months. Net Investment Hedges The Company primarily uses foreign currency denominated debt (third party and intercompany) to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in the foreign currency translation component of AOCI, as well as the offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are liquidated or sold. As of December 31, 2016 , $8.6 billion of third party foreign currency denominated debt, $3.3 billion of intercompany foreign currency denominated debt, and $393.0 million of derivatives were designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. ##TABLE_START Derivatives in Hedging Relationships  Gain (Loss) Recognized in AOCI (Effective Portion)  In millions    Foreign currency denominated debt   $ 654.9  $ 668.1 Foreign currency derivatives   9.9  79.1   $ 664.8  $ 747.2 ##TABLE_ENDUndesignated Derivatives The Company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting, therefore the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings together with the gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. As an example, the Company enters into equity derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Selling, general  administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in Nonoperating (income) expense, net, along with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position.  ##TABLE_START Derivatives Not Designated for Hedge Accounting  Gain (Loss) Recognized in Earnings  In millions    Foreign currency   $ 4.3  $ 14.6 Equity   26.0  38.9    $ 30.3  $ 53.5 ##TABLE_ENDCredit Risk The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its hedging instruments. The counterparties to these agreements consist of a diverse group of financial institutions and market participants. The Company continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and adjusts positions as appropriate. The Company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2016 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. For financial reporting purposes, the Company presents gross derivative balances in the financial statements and supplementary data, even for counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2016 , the Company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to negative fair value of certain derivative positions. The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions. INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES The Company, like other multi-national companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. Accordingly, tax liabilities are recorded when, in managements judgment, a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may still be recorded depending on managements assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled. The Company records interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.  McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 39 PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION Diluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of shares): 2016  6.8 ; 2015  5.2 ; 2014  5.8 . Stock options that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutive were (in millions of shares): 2016  1.2 ; 2015  1.0 ; 2014  5.3 . CASH AND EQUIVALENTS The Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). In January 2017, the Companys Board of Directors approved and the Company entered into a definitive agreement with a developmental licensee organization to sell its existing businesses in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden (referred to as the \"Nordics\") in connection with the Company's refranchising initiatives. The Nordics comprise nearly 450 restaurants, the vast majority of which are operated by independent franchisees. The Company expects to complete the transaction around the end of the first quarter, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions. Based on approval by the Board of Directors, the Company concluded the Nordics was held for sale in accordance with the requirements of ASC 360 \"Property, Plant and Equipment\". Accordingly, the Company has ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to the Nordics effective January 26, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, the Nordics' total assets and total liabilities were $439 million and $64 million , respectively. Cash proceeds upon the completion of the sale are estimated to be approximately $450 million . No significant gains or losses are expected to be recognized upon the close of the transaction. There were no other subsequent events that required recognition or disclosure. ##TABLE_START Property and Equipment  ##TABLE_ENDNet property and equipment consisted of: ##TABLE_START In millions December 31, 2016  Land $ 5,465.0  $ 5,582.5 Buildings and improvements on owned land 13,695.2  14,011.7 Buildings and improvements on leased land 11,511.9  12,892.9 Equipment, signs and seating 3,270.9  4,658.5 Other 500.4  546.8 Property and equipment, at cost (1) 34,443.4  37,692.4 Accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) (13,185.8 )  (14,574.8 ) Net property and equipment $ 21,257.6  $ 23,117.6 ##TABLE_END(1) In 2016, balances exclude $2.3 billion of property and equipment, at cost and $1.2 billion of accumulated depreciation and amortization that was reclassified to assets of businesses held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet in connection with the pending sale of the Company's businesses in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.

The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 40 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report ##TABLE_START Franchise Arrangements  ##TABLE_ENDConventional franchise arrangements generally include a lease and a license and provide for payment of initial fees, as well as continuing rent and royalties to the Company based upon a percent of sales with minimum rent payments that parallel the Companys underlying leases and escalations (on properties that are leased). Under this arrangement, franchisees are granted the right to operate a restaurant using the McDonalds System and, in most cases, the use of a restaurant facility, generally for a period of 20 years . These franchisees pay related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. Affiliates and developmental licensees operating under license agreements pay a royalty to the Company based upon a percent of sales, and may pay initial fees.

Lease terms for most restaurants, where market conditions allow, are generally for 20 years and, in many cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options, with certain leases providing purchase options. Escalation terms vary by market with examples including fixed-rent escalations, escalations based on an inflation index, and fair-value market adjustments. The timing of these escalations generally ranges from annually to every five years. For most locations, the Company is obligated for the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance; however, for franchised sites, the Company requires the franchisees to pay these costs. In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-cancelable leases covering certain offices and vehicles.

The remainder will expire at various dates from 2017 to 2031. The Company's effective income tax rate is typically lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because non-U.S. income is generally subject to local statutory country tax rates that are below the 35% U.S. statutory tax rate and reflect the impact of global transfer pricing. The statutory U.S. federal income tax rate reconciles to the effective income tax rates as follows: ##TABLE_START    Statutory U.S. federal income tax rate 35.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % State income taxes, net of related federal income tax benefit 1.5  1.6  1.6 Foreign income taxed at different rates (6.5 )  (4.9 )  (4.8 ) Taxes related to unfavorable lower tax court ruling and audit progression in foreign tax jurisdictions 1.2    4.1 Cash repatriation   (2.3 )  (1.2 ) Other, net 0.5  1.5  0.8 Effective income tax rates 31.7 %  30.9 %  35.5 % ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the Companys gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $924.1 million and $781.2 million , respectively. After considering the deferred tax accounting impact, it is expected that about $630 million of the total as of December 31, 2016 would favorably affect the effective tax rate if resolved in the Companys favor. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START In millions  Balance at January 1 $ 781.2  $ 988.1 Decreases for positions taken in prior years (37.1 )  (49.9 ) Increases for positions taken in prior years 150.1  30.5 Increases for positions related to the current year 116.6  83.7 Settlements with taxing authorities (17.7 )  (258.0 ) Lapsing of statutes of limitations (69.0 )  (13.2 ) Balance at December 31 (1) $ 924.1  $ 781.2 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Of this amount, $890.0 million and $704.0 million are included in Other long-term liabilities for 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and $9.0 million and $21.9 million are included in Current liabilities - income taxes for 2016 and 2015, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet. The remainder is included in Deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet. ##TABLE_END In 2015, the Company filed a protest with the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") Appeals Office related to certain disagreed transfer pricing matters related to the Company's U.S. federal income tax return audits for 2009 and 2010. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has not yet received a response to this protest from the IRS. In addition, the Company's 2011 and 2012 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under examination. The Company is also under audit in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions for matters primarily related to transfer pricing, and the Company is under audit in multiple state tax jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease up to $250 million within the next 12 months, of which up to $10 million could favorably affect the effective tax rate. This would be due to the possible settlement of the 2009 and 2010 IRS protest, receipt of the 2011 and 2012 Revenue Agent Report, completion of the aforementioned foreign and state tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions. In addition, it is reasonably possible that, as a result of audit progression in both the U.S. and foreign tax audits within the next 12 months, there may be new information that causes the Company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded. While the Company cannot estimate the impact that new information may have on our unrecognized tax benefit 42 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report balance, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined under ASC 740. The Company operates within multiple tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2009. The Company had $117.0 million and $83.6 million accrued for interest and penalties at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalties related to tax matters of $41.7 million in 2016 , $21.1 million in 2015 , and $87.9 million in 2014 , which are included in the provision for income taxes. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. These temporary differences were approximately $16.0 billion at December 31, 2016 and consisted primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. Determination of the deferred income tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.  ##TABLE_START Employee Benefit Plans  ##TABLE_ENDEffective January 1, 2017, the Companys Profit Sharing and Savings Plan was renamed the McDonalds 401k Plan. The 401k Plan is maintained for U.S.-based employees and includes a 401(k) feature, as well as an employer match. The 401(k) feature allows participants to make pre-tax contributions that are matched each pay period (with an annual true-up) from shares released under the leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") and employer cash contributions. All current account balances, future contributions and related earnings can be invested in eight investment alternatives as well as McDonalds stock in accordance with each participants investment elections. Future participant contributions are limited to 20% investment in McDonalds stock. Participants may choose to make separate investment choices for current account balances and future contributions. The Company also maintains certain nonqualified supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the 401k Plan because of IRS limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the 401k Plan. Total liabilities were $464.9 million at December 31, 2016 , and $487.6 million at December 31, 2015 , and were primarily included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of the liabilities. At December 31, 2016 , derivatives with a fair value of $134.3 million indexed to the Company's stock and a total return swap with a notional amount of $186.9 million indexed to certain market indices were included at their fair value in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in liabilities for these nonqualified plans and in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded primarily in Selling, general  administrative expenses. Changes in fair value of the derivatives indexed to the Companys stock are recorded in the income statement because the contracts provide the counterparty with a choice to settle in cash or shares.  Total U.S. costs for the 401k Plan, including nonqualified benefits and related hedging activities, were (in millions): 2016  $24.8 ; 2015  $24.0 ; 2014  $29.1 . Certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. also offer profit sharing, stock purchase or other similar benefit plans. Total plan costs outside the U.S. were (in millions): 2016  $46.0 ; 2015  $53.4 ; 2014  $54.4 . The total combined liabilities for international retirement plans were $65.6 million and $76.0 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Other post-retirement benefits and post- employment benefits were immaterial.

Fees and interest rates on this line are based on the Companys long-term credit rating assigned by Moodys and Standard  Poors . In addition, the Company's subsidiaries had unused lines of credit that were primarily uncommitted, short-term and denominated in various currencies at local market rates of interest . The weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings was 2.2% at December 31, 2016 (based on $192.0 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings and $799.8 million of commercial paper) and 2.0% at December 31, 2015 (based on $731.6 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings and $869.6 million of commercial paper). DEBT OBLIGATIONS The Company has incurred debt obligations principally through public and private offerings and bank loans. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions, and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. Under certain agreements, the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at par or at a premium over par. The Company has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt prior to maturity.

The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plans was 57.5 million at December 31, 2016 , including 34.1 million available for future grants. STOCK OPTIONS Stock options to purchase common stock are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Companys stock on the date of grant. Substantially all of the options become exercisable in four equal installments, beginning a year from the date of the grant, and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. Intrinsic value for stock options is defined as the difference between the current market value of the Companys stock and the exercise price. During 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $184.9 million , $202.9 million and $258.9 million , respectively. Cash received from stock options exercised during 2016 was $299.4 million and the tax benefit realized from stock options exercised totaled $54.5 million . The Company uses treasury shares purchased under the Companys share repurchase program to satisfy share-based exercises. A summary of the status of the Companys stock option grants as of December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , and changes during the years then ended, is presented in the following table: ##TABLE_START       Options Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price   Weighted- average remaining contractual life in years  Aggregate intrinsic value in millions   Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price   Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price  Outstanding at beginning of year 21.9   $ 84.76       23.4   $ 77.99  25.1   $ 69.15 Granted 4.3   117.10       4.3   97.33  3.9   95.13 Exercised (4.0 )   75.30       (5.1 )   62.59  (5.1 )   46.09 Forfeited/expired (0.7 )   106.50       (0.7 )   96.76  (0.5 )   94.56 Outstanding at end of year 21.5   $ 92.25  6.2   $ 633.9  21.9   $ 84.76  23.4   $ 77.99 Exercisable at end of year 13.4   $ 83.80  4.9   $ 507.5  13.4     14.4    ##TABLE_ENDRSUs RSUs generally vest 100% on the third anniversary of the grant and are payable in either shares of McDonalds common stock or cash, at the Companys discretion.

McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 47 ##TABLE_START Managements Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  ##TABLE_END The financial statements were prepared by management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity and for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: ##TABLE_START I. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START II. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START III. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ##TABLE_END There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may vary over time. Management assessed the design and effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on managements assessment using those criteria, as of December 31, 2016 , management believes that the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. Ernst  Young, LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 and the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 . Their reports are presented on the following pages. The independent registered public accountants and internal auditors advise management of the results of their audits, and make recommendations to improve the system of internal controls. Management evaluates the audit recommendations and takes appropriate action. McDONALDS CORPORATION March 1, 2017 48 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report ##TABLE_START Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  ##TABLE_ENDThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonalds Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McDonalds Corporation as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of McDonalds Corporation at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), McDonalds Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 1, 2017 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. ERNST  YOUNG LLP Chicago, Illinois March 1, 2017  McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 49 ##TABLE_START Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  ##TABLE_ENDThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonalds Corporation We have audited McDonald's Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). McDonalds Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report on Managements Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, McDonalds Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of McDonalds Corporation as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 , and our report dated March 1, 2017 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Controls and Procedures  ##TABLE_ENDDISCLOSURE CONTROLS An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), over the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2016 . Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING During the third quarter 2016, the Company commenced a phased initiative to transition some transaction-processing activities within certain accounting processes to a third-party service provider. The Company is performing the implementation in the ordinary course of business to increase efficiency. This is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Over time, this initiative is expected to continue to enhance the Company's internal control over financial reporting, but in the short-term may increase the Company's risk. Except for these ongoing changes, there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Business  ##TABLE_ENDMcDonalds Corporation, the registrant, together with its sub-sidiaries, is referred to herein as the Company. a. General During 2017 , there were no material changes to the Company's corporate structure or in its method of conducting business. The business is structured with segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth. Significant reportable segments include the United States (\"U.S.\"), International Lead Markets and High Growth Markets. In addition, throughout this report we present the Foundational Markets  Corporate segment, which includes markets in over 80 countries, as well as Corporate activities. b. Financial information about segments Segment data for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 are included in Part II, Item 8, page 47 of this Form 10-K. c. Narrative description of business ##TABLE_START  General ##TABLE_END The Company operates and franchises McDonalds restaurants, which serve a locally-relevant menu of quality food and beverages sold at various price points in more than 100 countries. McDonalds global system is comprised of both Company-owned and franchised restaurants. McDonalds franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures - conventional franchise, developmental license or affiliate. The optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant, trading area or market (country) is based on a variety of factors, including the availability of individuals with the entrepreneurial experience and financial resources, as well as the local legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property ownership and franchising. We continually review our mix of Company-owned and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be approximately 95% franchised over the long term. The business relationship between McDonalds and its independent franchisees is of fundamental importance to overall performance and to the McDonalds brand. This business relationship is supported by an agreement that requires adherence to standards and policies essential to protecting our brand. The Company is primarily a franchisor, with more than 90% of McDonald's restaurants currently owned and operated by independent franchisees. Franchising enables an individual to be their own employer and maintain control over all employment related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of McDonalds global brand, operating system and financial resources. One of the strengths of this model is that the expertise gained from operating Company-owned restaurants allows McDonalds to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and, when viable, efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants. Directly operating McDonalds restaurants contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor. Having Company-owned restaurants provides Company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience. In addition, in our Company-owned and operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we are able to further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit McDonalds restaurants. Under a conventional franchise arrangement, the Company generally owns the land and building or secures a long-term lease for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment, signs, seating and dcor. The Company believes that ownership of real estate, combined with the co-investment by franchisees, enables us to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. Franchisees are also responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time. In addition, to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives, the Company frequently co-invests with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or their operating systems. These investments, developed with input from McDonalds with the aim of improving local business performance, increase the value of our brand through the development of modernized, more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants. The Companys typical franchise term is 20 years. The Company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors. The business relationship with franchisees is designed to ensure consistency and high quality at all McDonalds restaurants. Conventional franchisees contribute to the Companys revenue through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees paid upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new franchise. This structure enables McDonalds to generate significant levels of cash flow. Under a developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest. The Company generally does not invest any capital under a developmental license arrangement. The Company receives a royalty based upon a percent of sales as well as initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license. We use the developmental license ownership structure in over 80 countries with a total of approximately 6,900 restaurants. The largest developmental licensee operates approximately 2,200 restaurants in 19 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Finally, the Company also has an equity investment in a limited number of foreign affiliated markets, referred to as affiliates. In these markets, the Company receives a royalty based on a percent of sales and records its share of net results in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. In 2017, the Company completed the sale of its businesses in China and Hong Kong, while retaining a 20% ownership in the entity that now owns the business. There are approximately 5,800 restaurants in foreign affiliated markets, the largest of which are Japan and China, where there are about 2,900 and 2,600 restaurants, respectively. ##TABLE_START  Supply Chain and Quality Assurance ##TABLE_END The Company and its franchisees purchase food, packaging, equipment and other goods from numerous independent suppliers. The Company has established and enforces high quality standards and product specifications. The Company has quality centers around the world designed to ensure that its high standards are consistently met. The quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews, but also on-site supplier visits. A Food Safety Advisory Council, composed of the Companys technical, safety and supply chain specialists, as well as suppliers and outside academia, provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food safety. In addition, the Company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation, assure best practices and drive continuous improvement. Leveraging scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies, the Company also collaborates with suppliers toward a goal of achieving competitive, predictable food and paper costs over the long term.  McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 1 Independently owned and operated distribution centers, approved by the Company, distribute products and supplies to McDonalds restaurants. In addition, restaurant personnel are trained in the proper storage, handling and preparation of products. ##TABLE_START  Products ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu, although there are geographic variations to suit local consumer preferences and tastes. In addition, McDonalds tests new products on an ongoing basis. McDonalds menu includes hamburgers and cheeseburgers, Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Filet-O-Fish, several chicken sandwiches, Chicken McNuggets, wraps, french fries, salads, oatmeal, shakes, McFlurry desserts, sundaes, soft serve cones, pies, soft drinks, coffee, McCaf beverages and other beverages. In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of other products during limited-time promotions. McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. and many international markets offer a full or limited breakfast menu. Breakfast offerings may include Egg McMuffin, Sausage McMuffin with Egg, McGriddles, biscuit and bagel sandwiches and hotcakes. Quality, choice and nutrition are increasingly important to our customers and we are continuously evolving our menu to meet our customers' needs. ##TABLE_START  Marketing ##TABLE_END McDonalds global brand is well known. Marketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed to promote McDonalds brand and differentiate the Company from competitors. Marketing and promotional efforts focus on value, quality, food taste, menu choice, nutrition, convenience and the customer experience. ##TABLE_START  Intellectual property ##TABLE_END The Company owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information. The Company considers the trademarks McDonalds and The Golden Arches Logo to be of material importance to its business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. Patents, copyrights and licenses are of varying durations. ##TABLE_START  Seasonal operations ##TABLE_END The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree. ##TABLE_START  Working capital practices ##TABLE_END Information about the Companys working capital practices is incorporated herein by reference to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 in Part II, Item 7, pages 14 through 29, and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 in Part II, Item 8, page 34 of this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START  Customers ##TABLE_END The Companys business is not dependent upon either a single customer or small group of customers. ##TABLE_START  Backlog ##TABLE_END Company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders. ##TABLE_START  Government contracts ##TABLE_END No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at government election. ##TABLE_START  Competition ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of food products. The Company competes on the basis of price, convenience, service, menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry. In measuring the Companys competitive position, management reviews data compiled by Euromonitor International, a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry. The Companys primary competition, which is referred to as the informal eating out (\"IEO\") segment, includes the following restaurant categories defined by Euromonitor International: quick-service eating establishments, casual dining full-service restaurants, street stalls or kiosks, cafs,100% home delivery/takeaway providers, specialist coffee shops, self-service cafeterias and juice/smoothie bars. The IEO segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and full-service restaurants other than casual dining. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the global IEO segment was composed of approximately 9 million outlets and generated $1.2 trillion in annual sales in 2016 , the most recent year for which data is available. McDonalds Systemwide 2016 restaurant business accounted for 0.4% of those outlets and 7.0% of the sales. Management also on occasion benchmarks McDonalds against the entire restaurant industry, including the IEO segment defined above and all other full-service restaurants. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 19 million outlets and generated $2.4 trillion in annual sales in 2016 . McDonalds Systemwide restaurant business accounted for 0.2% of those outlets and 3.5% of the sales. ##TABLE_START  Research and development ##TABLE_END The Company performs research and development activities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. While research and development activities are important to the Companys business, these expenditures are not material. Independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the \"System\"). ##TABLE_START  Environmental matters ##TABLE_END The Company continuously endeavors to improve its social responsibility and environmental practices to achieve long-term sustainability, which benefits McDonalds and the communities it serves. Increased focus by certain governmental authorities on environmental matters may lead to new governmental initiatives. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. Although the impact would likely vary by world region and/or market, we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs for the Company. Also, there is a possibility that governmental initiatives, or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns, climate, or water resources, could have a direct impact on the operations of the System in ways which we cannot predict at this time. The Company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner. At this time, the Company has already begun to undertake its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment, including the implementation of more energy efficient equipment and management of energy use and more sustainable sourcing practices in many of its markets. 2 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report ##TABLE_START  Number of employees ##TABLE_END The Companys number of employees worldwide, including its corporate office employees and company-owned restaurant employees, was approximately 235,000 as of year-end 2017 . d.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  ##TABLE_END The information in this report includes forward-looking statements about future events and circumstances and their effects upon revenues, expenses and business opportunities. Generally speaking, any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by the use of forward-looking words, such as may, will, expect, believe, anticipate and plan or similar expressions. In particular, statements regarding our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry, including those under \"Outlook\", are forward-looking statements. They reflect our expectations, are not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the date of this report. Except as required by law, we do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements. Our business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are reflected in the following considerations and factors, as well as elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. If any of these considerations or risks materialize, our expectations may change and our performance may be adversely affected. If we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, we may not be able to increase operating income. To drive future results, our business strategies must be effective in delivering increased guest counts to drive operating income growth. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our Systems ability to: ##TABLE_START  Continue to innovate and differentiate the McDonalds experience by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Capitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to enhance our ability to retain, regain and convert key customer groups; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Utilize our more adaptive organizational structure to execute against our initiatives at an accelerated pace; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Strengthen customer appeal and augment our digital initiatives, including mobile ordering and delivery, along with Experience of the Future (EOTF), particularly in the U.S.; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operate restaurants with high service levels and optimal capacity while managing the increasing complexity of our restaurant operations. ##TABLE_END If we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Our investments to enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected returns. We will continue to build upon our investments in EOTF, which focus on restaurant modernization and technology and digital engagement in order to transform the restaurant experience. As we accelerate our pace of converting restaurants to EOTF, we are placing renewed emphasis on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives, as well as mobile ordering and payment systems. We also continue to build on delivery initiatives, which may not generate expected returns. We may not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, or these initiatives may not be well executed, and therefore our business results may suffer. If we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences, our business could suffer. Our continued success depends on our Systems ability to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics, and trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food offerings and consumer preferences in the informal eating out IEO segment. In order to deliver a relevant experience for our customers amidst a highly competitive, value-driven operating environment, we must implement initiatives to adapt at an aggressive pace. There is no assurance  McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 3 that these initiatives will be successful and, if they are not, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Activities relating to our refranchising and cost savings initiatives remain ongoing and entail various risks. Our previously announced refranchising and cost saving initiatives remain ongoing. As we continue on those initiatives, the existing risks we face in our business may be intensified. Our efforts to reduce costs and capital expenditures depend, in part, upon our refranchising efforts, which, in turn, depend upon our selection and integration of capable third parties. Our cost savings initiatives also depend upon a variety of factors, including our ability to achieve efficiencies through the consolidation of global, back-office functions. If these various initiatives are not successful, take longer to complete than initially projected, or are not well executed, or if our cost reduction efforts adversely impact our effectiveness, our business operations, financial results and results of operations could be adversely affected. If pricing, promotional and marketing plans are not effective, our results may be negatively impacted. Our results depend on the impact of pricing, promotional and marketing plans across the System, and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer preferences, as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions. Existing or future pricing strategies, and the value proposition they represent, are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy; however, they may not be successful and could negatively impact sales and margins. Further, the promotion of menu offerings may yield results below the desired levels. Additionally, we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful, and we may fail to attract and retain customers. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels allows us to reach our customers effectively. If the advertising and marketing programs are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease. Failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results. To be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brand. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions. Those perceptions are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, our business practices and the manner in which we source the commodities we use. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the IEO segment or perceptions of our brand generally or relative to available alternatives. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by third parties presenting or promoting adverse commentary or portrayals of the quick-service category of the IEO segment, our brand and/or our operations, our suppliers or our franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing such adverse commentary or portrayals, our brand and our financial results may suffer. Additionally, the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our sustainability initiatives, which require System-wide coordination and alignment. If we are not effective in addressing social responsibility matters or achieving relevant sustainability goals, consumer trust in our brand may suffer. In particular, business incidents or practices that erode consumer trust or confidence, particularly if such incidents or practices receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results. We face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business. We compete primarily in the IEO segment, which is highly competitive. We also face sustained, intense competition from traditional, fast casual and other competitors, which may include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores, grocery stores and coffee shops. We expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive, and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by new or continuing actions of our competitors, which may have a short- or long-term impact on our results. We compete on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. In particular, we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, develop new products, price our products appropriately, deliver a relevant customer experience, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations and respond effectively to our competitors actions or disruptive actions from others which we do not foresee. Recognizing these dependencies, we have intensified our focus in recent periods on strategies to achieve these goals, and we will likely continue to modify our strategies and implement new strategies in the future. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics. Unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions, which can vary significantly by market and can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits. Economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including hostilities, epidemics and actions taken by governments to manage national and international economic matters, whether through austerity, stimulus measures or trade measures, and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers. Continued adverse economic conditions or adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could pressure our operating performance, and our business and financial results may suffer. Our results of operations are also affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect reported earnings. Supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues. We depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient product supply, including on favorable terms. Although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain products have limited suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers. Supply chain interruptions, including shortages and transportation issues, and price increases can adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. Such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers, 4 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report franchisees or us. If we experience interruptions in our Systems supply chain, our costs could increase and it could limit the availability of products critical to our Systems operations. Food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business. Our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our Systems ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonalds of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future. Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe food products, including as our menu and service model evolve. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. Instances of food tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our brand and reputation as well as our revenues and profits. Our franchise business model presents a number of risks. Our success increasingly relies on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, including our developmental licensees and affiliates, yet we have limited influence over their operations. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from Company-operated restaurants. Our franchisees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. If our franchisees do not experience sales growth, our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result. Also, if sales trends worsen for franchisees, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, restaurant closures, or delayed or reduced payments to us. Our refranchising efforts will continue to increase that dependence and the potential effect of those factors. Our success also increasingly depends on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. Franchisees ability to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general or by the creditworthiness of our franchisees or the Company. Our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brands image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results. Our ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing. Our ability to achieve the benefits of our refranchising strategy, which involves a significant percentage of franchised restaurants, including an increased number of restaurants run by developmental licensees and affiliates, depends on various factors. Those factors include whether we have effectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or affiliates that meet our rigorous standards, and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives. Challenges with respect to talent management could harm our business. Effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Failure to effectively identify, develop and retain key personnel, recruit high-quality candidates and ensure smooth management and personnel transitions could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results. Our success depends in part on our Systems ability to recruit, motivate and retain a qualified workforce to work in our restaurants in an intensely competitive environment. Increased costs associated with recruiting, motivating and retaining qualified employees to work in our Company-operated restaurants could have a negative impact on our Company-operated margins. Similar concerns apply to our franchisees. We are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and international regulations affecting our workforce, which includes our staff and employees working in our Company-operated restaurants. These regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues, including wage and hour, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. Our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers (or perceptions thereof) could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business. Additionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to recruit and retain talent) or the franchisees and suppliers that are also part of the McDonald's System and whose performance may have a material impact on our results. Information technology system failures or interruptions, or breaches of network security, may interrupt our operations. We are increasingly reliant on technological systems, such as point-of-sale and other in-store systems or platforms, technologies supporting McDonalds delivery and digital solutions, as well as technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration internally, with affiliated entities, customers or independent third parties to conduct our business, including technology-enabled systems provided to us by third parties. Any failure of these systems could significantly impact our operations and customer experience and perceptions. Despite the implementation of security measures, those technology systems and solutions could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Our increasing reliance on third party systems also present the risks faced by the third partys business, including the operational, security and credit risks of those parties. If those systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we could experience an interruption in our operations. Furthermore, security breaches have from time to time occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems, the systems of the parties we communicate or collaborate with (including franchisees), or those of third party providers. These may include such things as unauthorized access, denial of service, computer viruses, introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Our information technology systems contain personal, financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our customers,  McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 5 our employees and other third parties, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. An actual or alleged security breach could result in disruptions, shutdowns, theft or unauthorized disclosure of personal, financial, proprietary or other confidential information. The occurrence of any of these incidents could result in reputational damage, adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, complications in executing our growth initiatives and criminal penalties or civil liabilities. The global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business. We encounter differing cultural, regulatory and economic environments within and among the more than 100 countries where McDonalds restaurants operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on the System's success in these environments. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our Systems ability to leverage operating successes across markets. Planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with McDonald's customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts. Disruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or changes in trade-related tariffs or controls, government-mandated closure of our, our franchisees' or our suppliers operations, and asset seizures. The cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or inquiries, whether or not they have merit, may impact our results and could cause reputational or other harm. Our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brand-building initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental investigations or inquiries. Additionally, challenges and uncertainties are associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. Such challenges may be exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. An inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We may also face challenges and uncertainties in developed markets. For example, as a result of the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union through a negotiated exit over a period of time, including its recent formal commencement of exit proceedings, it is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities, as well as potential referenda in the U.K. and/or other European countries, that could cause uncertainty in European or worldwide economic conditions. In the short term, the decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates, and the resulting depression in those exchange rates may continue. Any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world. In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or policy or related authoritative interpretations, including changes and uncertainties resulting from proposals for comprehensive or corporate tax reforms in the U.S. or elsewhere. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) was signed into law. While we have estimated the effects of the Tax Act, we continue to refine those estimates with the possibility they could change, and those changes could be material. We are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by taxing authorities inside and outside of the U.S. in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. Any increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations. The profitability of our Company-operated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, including food, paper, supplies, fuel, utilities and distribution, and other operating costs, including labor. Any volatility in certain commodity prices or fluctuation in labor costs could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability. The commodity markets for some of the ingredients we use, such as beef and chicken, are particularly volatile due to factors such as seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, international commodity markets, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulation, all of which are beyond our control and, in many instances, unpredictable. We can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities, and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Increasing regulatory complexity may adversely affect restaurant operations and our financial results. Our regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. We are affected by the cost, compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face, including where inconsistent standards imposed by multiple governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings. Our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of new, potential or changing regulations that can affect our business plans and operations. These regulations include product packaging, marketing, the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices. Compliance efforts with those regulations may be affected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers (particularly given varying requirements and practices for testing and disclosure). Additionally, we are working to manage the risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources. These risks include the increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, such as packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. These risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets or 6 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report establish additional goals and take actions to meet them. These risks could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us. Increasing legal complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. We could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, employment and personal injury claims, landlord/tenant disputes, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former franchisees and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another partys trademarks, copyrights or patents). Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to regulatory proceedings or litigation. Litigation involving our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law purposes, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. Similarly, although our commercial relationships with our suppliers remain independent, there may be attempts to challenge that independence, which, if determined adversely, could also increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our suppliers, and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. We are also subject to legal and compliance risks and associated liability, such as in the areas of privacy and data collection, protection and management, as it relates to information we collect and share when we provide optional technology-related services and platforms to third parties. Our operating results could also be affected by the following: ##TABLE_START  The relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The cost and other effects of settlements, judgments or consent decrees, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The scope and terms of insurance or indemnification protections that we may have. ##TABLE_END A judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage or third party indemnity could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt our business. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the McDonalds brand and our business. The success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products. We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. In particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business. We cannot ensure that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property. Changes in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future operations and results. New accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results. We may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings. In assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, consumer and demographic trends, and our restructuring activities. If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. If we experience any such changes, they could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods. A decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability. Our credit ratings may be negatively affected by our results of operations or changes in our debt levels. As a result, our interest expense, the availability of acceptable counterparties, our ability to obtain funding on favorable terms, collateral requirements and our operating or financial flexibility could all be negatively affected, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants. Our operations may also be impacted by regulations affecting capital flows, financial markets or financial institutions, which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs. If any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 7 Trading volatility and price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors. Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these factors, some of which are outside our control, are the following: ##TABLE_START  The unpredictable nature of global economic and market conditions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the U.S., which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can be affected by market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete); unauthorized disclosures about our performance, plans or expectations about our business; our actual performance and creditworthiness; investor confidence, driven in part by expectations about our performance; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonalds may be included, such as the SP 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of our stock repurchase program or dividend rate; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact on our results of corporate actions and market and third-party perceptions and assessments of such actions, such as those we may take from time to time as we implement our strategies in light of changing business, legal and tax considerations and evolve our corporate structure. ##TABLE_END Events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others, can adversely affect our results and prospects. Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels and supply availability and costs, as well as the local operations in impacted markets, all of which can affect our results and prospects. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses fully. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments  ##TABLE_ENDNone. ##TABLE_START ", "2": " ITEM 2. Properties  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company owns and leases real estate primarily in connection with its restaurant business. The Company identifies and develops sites that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential to the Company. To assess potential, the Company analyzes traffic and walking patterns, census data and other relevant data. The Companys experience and access to advanced technology aid in evaluating this information. The Company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for conventional franchised and Company-operated restaurant sites, which ensures long-term occupancy rights and helps control related costs. Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to control average development costs through construction and design efficiencies, standardization and by leveraging the Companys global sourcing network. Additional information about the Companys properties is included in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7, pages 14 through 29 and in Financial statements and supplementary data in Part II, Item 8, pages 30 through 50 of this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START ", "3": " ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company has pending a number of lawsuits that have been filed in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover a broad variety of allegations spanning the Companys entire business. The following is a brief description of the more significant types of claims and lawsuits. In addition, the Company is subject to various national and local laws and regulations that impact various aspects of its business, as discussed below. While the Company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, unfavorable rulings could occur. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on net income for the period in which the ruling occurs or for future periods. ##TABLE_START  Franchising ##TABLE_END A substantial number of McDonalds restaurants are franchised to independent owner/operators under contractual arrangements with the Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company and its current or former franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects including, but not limited to, quality, service and cleanliness issues, menu pricing, contentions regarding grants or terminations of franchises, delinquent payments of rents and fees, and franchisee claims for additional franchises or rewrites of franchises. Additionally, occasional disputes arise between the Company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a McDonalds franchise or who challenge the legal distinction between the Company and its franchisees for employment law purposes. ##TABLE_START  Suppliers ##TABLE_END The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries generally do not supply food, paper or related items to any McDonalds restaurants. The Company relies upon numerous independent suppliers, including service providers, that are required to meet and maintain the Companys high standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company and its suppliers (or former suppliers) which include, for example, compliance with product specifications and the Companys business relationship with suppliers. In addition, disputes occasionally arise on a number of issues between the Company and individuals or entities who claim that they should be (or should have been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the Companys restaurants. ##TABLE_START  Employees ##TABLE_END Hundreds of thousands of people are employed by the Company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, thousands of people from time to time seek employment in such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes arise regarding hiring, termination, promotion and pay practices, including wage and hour disputes, alleged discrimination and compliance with labor and employment laws. ##TABLE_START  Customers ##TABLE_END Restaurants owned by subsidiaries of the Company regularly serve a broad segment of the public. In so doing, disputes arise as to products, service, incidents, advertising, nutritional and other 8 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report disclosures, as well as other matters common to an extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company. ##TABLE_START  Intellectual Property ##TABLE_END The Company has registered trademarks and service marks, patents and copyrights, some of which are of material importance to the Companys business. From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation to protect its intellectual property and defend against the alleged use of third party intellectual property.  ##TABLE_START  Government Regulations ##TABLE_END Local and national governments have adopted laws and regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business including, but not limited to, advertising, franchising, health, safety, environment, zoning, employment and taxation.

Given the Companys returns on incremental invested capital and assets, management believes it is prudent to reinvest in the business in markets with acceptable returns and/or opportunity for long-term growth and use excess cash flow to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The Company has paid dividends on common stock for 42 consecutive years through 2017 and has increased the dividend amount at least once every year. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors.

McDonald's is included in published restaurant indices; however, unlike most other companies included in these indices, which have no or limited international operations, McDonald's does business in more than 100 countries and a substantial portion of our revenues and income is generated outside the U.S. In addition, because of our size, McDonald's inclusion in those indices tends to skew the results. Therefore, we believe that such a comparison is not meaningful. Our market capitalization, trading volume and importance in an industry that is vital to the U.S. economy have resulted in McDonald's inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) since 1985. Like McDonald's, many DJIA companies generate meaningful revenues and income outside the U.S. and some manage global brands. Thus, we believe that the use of the DJIA companies as the group for comparison purposes is appropriate. The following performance graph shows McDonald's cumulative total shareholder returns (i.e., price appreciation and reinvestment of dividends) relative to the Standard  Poor's 500 Stock Index (SP 500 Index) and to the DJIA companies for the five-year period ended December 31, 2017 . The graph assumes that the value of an investment in McDonald's common stock, the SP 500 Index and the DJIA companies (including McDonald's) was $100 at December 31, 2012 . For the DJIA companies, returns are weighted for market capitalization as of the beginning of each period indicated. These returns may vary from those of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, which is not weighted by market capitalization, and may be composed of different companies during the period under consideration. ##TABLE_START Company/Index 12/31/2012 12/31/2013 12/31/2014 12/31/2015 12/31/2016 12/31/2017 McDonald's Corporation $100 $114 $113 $148 $157 $228 SP 500 Index 132 153 208 Dow Jones Industrials 130 143 213 ##TABLE_ENDSource: SP Capital IQ 12 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report ##TABLE_START ", "6": " ITEM 6.

Franchised restaurants represent more than 90% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide at December 31, 2017. ##TABLE_END McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 13 ##TABLE_START ", "7": " ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  ##TABLE_ENDOverview DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants. Of the 37,241 restaurants in 120 countries at year-end 2017 , 34,108 were franchised (reflects 21,366 franchised to conventional franchisees, 6,945 licensed to developmental licensees and 5,797 licensed to foreign affiliates (\"affiliates\")primarily in Japan and China) and 3,133 were operated by the Company. Under McDonald's conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and dcor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees enabling restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in the reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants in an effort to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives. Under McDonald's developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company generally has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a number of affiliates (primarily in Japan and China) that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market. McDonald's is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. Franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment-related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the financial strength and global experience of McDonald's. However, directly operating restaurants is important to being a credible franchisor and provides Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, McDonald's further develops and refines operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that the Company believes are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. McDonald's continually reviews its mix of Company-operated and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be approximately 95% franchised over the long term. The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The business is structured into the following segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth, and reflect how management reviews and evaluates operating performance: ##TABLE_START  U.S. - the Company's largest segment. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  International Lead Markets - established markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the U.K. and related markets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  High Growth Markets - markets that the Company believes have relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential including China, Italy, Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, Switzerland and related markets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Foundational Markets  Corporate - the remaining markets in the McDonald's system, most of which operate under a largely franchised model. Corporate activities are also reported within this segment. ##TABLE_END For the year ended December 31, 2017 , the U.S., International Lead Markets and High Growth Markets accounted for 35% , 32% and 24% of total revenues, respectively. In analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures which are considered to be non-GAAP, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, return on incremental invested capital (\"ROIIC\"), free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below. ##TABLE_START  Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases most incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents its underlying business trends. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the Companys initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation, and, beginning in 2017, also exclude sales from Venezuela due to its hyper-inflation. Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Typically, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. The goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Companys financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus ##TABLE_END14 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. ##TABLE_START  Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Companys ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. ##TABLE_END STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the \"System\") is key to McDonald's long-term success. By leveraging the System, McDonalds is able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. McDonald's continually builds on its competitive advantages of System alignment and geographic diversification to deliver consistent, yet locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers as an integral part of their communities. CUSTOMER-CENTRIC GROWTH STRATEGY Beginning in 2015, the Company made purposeful changes to execute against key elements of its turnaround plan including a renewed focus on running better restaurants, driving operational growth, returning excitement to the brand and enhancing financial value. The Companys current momentum is broad-based throughout the System and its recent performance demonstrates that McDonalds has completed the transition from turnaround to growth. In 2017, the Company shifted its focus to delivering long-term growth through accelerated execution of its customer-centric strategy - the Velocity Growth Plan. This plan outlines actions to drive sustainable guest count growth, a reliable long-term measure of the Company's strength, that is vital to growing sales and shareholder value. The Velocity Growth Plan is rooted in extensive customer research and insights, along with a deep understanding of the key drivers of the business. The Company is targeting the tremendous opportunity at the core of its business - its food, value and customer experience. The strategy is built on the following three pillars, all focusing on building a better McDonalds: ##TABLE_START  Retaining existing customers - focusing on areas where it already has a strong foothold in the IEO category, including family occasions and food-led breakfast. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Regaining lost customers - recommitting to areas of historic strength, namely food taste and quality, convenience and value. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Converting casual to committed customers - building stronger relationships with customers so they visit more often, by elevating and leveraging the McCaf coffee brand and enhancing snack and treat offerings. ##TABLE_END In each pillar, McDonalds has established sustainable platforms that enable execution of the plan with greater speed, efficiency and impact while remaining relentlessly focused on the fundamentals of running great restaurants. Additionally, through three identified growth accelerators - Experience of the Future (EOTF), Digital and Delivery - McDonalds is enhancing the overall customer experience with hospitable, friendly service and ever-improving convenience for customers on their terms. The Company met aggressive deployment targets for each one of these accelerators in 2017 and continues further implementation in 2018 and beyond. ##TABLE_START  Experience of the Future. The Company continues to build upon its investments in EOTF, focusing on restaurant modernization and technology, in order to transform the restaurant service experience and enhance the brand in the eyes of the customer. The modernization efforts are designed to drive incremental customer visits and higher average check. McDonalds currently has EOTF deployed in about one-third of the restaurants globally, with half of the U.S. restaurants expected to be deployed by the end of 2018. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Digital. As the Company accelerates its pace of converting restaurants to EOTF, it is placing renewed emphasis on improving its existing service model (i.e., eat in, take out, or drive-thru) and strengthening its relationships with customers through technology. By evolving the technology platform, the Company is expanding choices for how customers order, pay and are served through additional functionality on its global mobile app, self-order kiosks and technology-driven models that enable table service and curb-side pick-up. In the U.S. alone, McDonalds now has over 20 million registered users of the McDonalds application. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Delivery . The Company continues to further scale its delivery platform as a way of expanding the convenience customers receive from McDonald's. In 2017, McDonalds added delivery to 7,000 restaurants in 21 different countries. Including previously offering delivery in Asia and the Middle East, McDonalds is now delivering meals from over 10,000 restaurants. In addition to added convenience, delivery transactions tend to realize a higher average check and a high customer satisfaction rating. In 2018, while the Company expects to continue to expand the number of restaurants offering delivery, the focus will shift to growing awareness and demand in the areas where delivery is already offered. ##TABLE_END  In 2018, McDonalds has plans to raise consumer awareness of the enhanced convenience available with delivery and mobile order and pay through thoughtful marketing campaigns that aim to increase the number of customers enjoying these expanded options to engage with the brand. The Company is optimistic that this will contribute to the continued momentum of the business. In addition to the customer-relevant changes in the restaurants, the Company has enhanced financial value through its refranchising efforts, GA cost savings initiatives and cash return to shareholders. In 2017, the Company achieved its target to refranchise 4,000 restaurants, a full year ahead of the original target date. McDonalds is currently 92% franchised, with a long-term goal of approximately 95%. The transition to a more heavily franchised business model is benefiting the Companys performance, as the rent and royalty income received from franchisees provides a more predictable and stable revenue stream with significantly lower operating costs and risks. This includes a less GA and capital intensive structure as franchisees are responsible for supporting and reinvesting in their businesses. Under this more heavily franchised structure, growing comparable sales will be the strongest driver of operating income growth and returns. Through execution of the Velocity Growth Plan, McDonalds is serving more customers more often. In 2018, the Company remains aggressively focused on executing its ambitious plan to unlock more of its potential and drive long-term sustainable growth.  McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 15 Our Velocity Growth Plan also includes the Company doing its part to further embed certain social and environmental issues into the core of our business, which we refer to as our Scale for Good. As one of the worlds largest restaurant companies, our Scale for Good highlights our commitment to global priorities that are consistent with our strategic priorities and provides an opportunity to collaborate with our franchisees and suppliers to drive meaningful progress. We believe it is important for customers to feel good about visiting McDonalds restaurants and eating our food in order to continue to drive each of the pillars within our strategy. While we're committed to addressing many challenges facing society today, we're elevating a few global priorities that reflect analysis of major social and environmental impacts of our food and our business and the material environmental and social issues that matter most to our customers, employees, franchisees, suppliers and stakeholders. Our four global priorities are: beef sustainability, packaging and recycling, commitment to families and our investment in people. Beyond these global priorities, we will continue to drive progress on our goals and commitments across key social and environmental topics such as climate change, diversity, animal health and welfare, and supporting families and farmers. 2017 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The Company's 2017 financial performance demonstrates that the Velocity Growth Plan is working. By focusing on the aforementioned three pillars, and the identified growth accelerators, the Company achieved its best comparable sales performance in six years. In 2017, global comparable sales increased 5.3% and global comparable guest counts increased 1.9% , with positive results achieved in all segments. ##TABLE_START  Comparable sales in the U.S. increased 3.6% and comparable guest counts increased 1.0%. The growth in comparable sales and guest counts was supported by the full breadth of our menu, including national beverage value offerings, strong performance of core menu items featured under the McPick 2 platform as well as Signature Crafted premium sandwiches and other menu innovations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Comparable sales in the International Lead segment increased 5.3% and comparable guest counts increased 2.3%, reflecting positive performance across all of the segment, led by the U.K. and Canada. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In the High Growth segment, comparable sales increased 5.3% and comparable guest counts increased 1.8%. This performance reflects positive results across most of the segment, led by China. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Comparable sales in the Foundational Markets increased 9.0% and comparable guest counts increased 3.3%, led by strong performance in Japan and Latin America, as well as solid results across the remainder of the segment. ##TABLE_END In addition to improved comparable sales and guest count performance, the Company achieved the following financial results in 2017: ##TABLE_START  Consolidated revenues decreased 7% ( 8% in constant currencies) as positive comparable sales were more than offset by the impact of refranchising. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Systemwide sales increased 7% ( 7% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consolidated operating income increased 23% ( 23% in constant currencies), which benefited from a gain on the sale of the Companys businesses in China and Hong Kong. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating margin, defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues, increased from 31.5% in 2016 to 41.9% in 2017 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted earnings per share of $6.37 increased 17% ( 17% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash provided by operations was $5.6 billion . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Capital expenditures of $1.9 billion were allocated mainly to reinvestment in existing restaurants and, to a lesser extent, to new restaurant openings. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Across the System, about 900 restaurants (including those in our developmental licensee and affiliated markets) were opened. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Free cash flow was $3.7 billion (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  One-year ROIIC was 1,671.8% and three-year ROIIC was 93.1% for the period ended December 31, 2017 . Excluding the gain from the sale of businesses in China and Hong Kong, as well as significant investing cash inflows from strategic refranchising initiatives, one year and three year ROIIC were 48.3% and 43.6%, respectively (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company increased its quarterly cash dividend per share by 7% to $1.01 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $4.04 per share. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company returned $7.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends for the year. ##TABLE_END 16 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report AREAS OF FOCUS BY SEGMENT U.S. The U.S. remains diligent in driving guest count growth momentum in 2018 by continuing to focus on actions that collectively transform the customer experience. With the launch of the $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu in January 2018, the Company is offering a compelling, national value program that resonates with customers. Additionally, an emphasis on food taste and quality will remain a key priority. In 2018, the U.S. is planning to introduce fresh beef across the majority of its restaurants, cooked right when ordered and served hot off the grill for all Quarter Pounder burgers. The U.S. will also offer new seasonal flavors to further expand the McCaf espresso line in 2018, following its successful relaunch of McCaf in 2017. The pace of activity in the U.S. remains accelerated with a focus on increasing customer awareness of its global mobile application, mobile order and pay functionality as well as its delivery platform. Further, the Company is accelerating its investment in EOTF as it expects to complete nearly 4,000 U.S. restaurants in 2018. A majority of traditional restaurants in the U.S. are expected to be substantially complete with EOTF by the end of 2019, offering a holistic, modern experience for customers. International Lead Markets International Lead markets continue to deepen their connection with customers and meet their changing needs with meaningful enhancements in menu, accessibility and experience. The segment is focused on providing quality, great taste, value and choice across the entire menu. Programs across the segment are energizing the core menu, and every market has successfully extended into premium chicken and beef, in addition to locally relevant offerings. All of this is supported by modernized cooking and service platforms that expand capacity and enable hotter, fresher products. Entry-level value programs appeal to teens and young adults, while other platforms provide budget-conscious customers affordable meal bundles. International Lead markets remain focused on enhancing and expanding the McCaf coffee brand and the ongoing deployment of EOTF restaurants across the segment. In addition to EOTF, the continued roll out of delivery provides customers with the high levels of convenience they are seeking. High Growth Markets McDonalds High Growth markets have leveraged ideas around design, digital, people, menu innovation and value from other markets to enhance the customer experience. Driving operational growth in existing restaurants and targeted new restaurant development are top priorities. In 2017, the Company sold its businesses in China and Hong Kong to a licensee. Continued successful integration of the segments new licensee into the System will further enable restaurant growth, menu innovation and convenience strategies suited to each markets customers. Foundational Markets Foundational markets are a diverse group that share the common goal of enhancing critical elements that differentiate McDonalds - the menu and the customer experience. The segment is committed to running great restaurants and increasing convenience to customers, including drive-thru and delivery. OUTLOOK 2018 Outlook The following information is provided to assist in forecasting the Companys future results. ##TABLE_START  Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales, net restaurant unit expansion, and the potential impacts of hyper-inflation. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1 percentage point to 2018 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the U.S. or the International Lead segment would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 5 to 6 cents. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the guidance issued in Accounting Standards Codification 606, \"Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers\". This standard changed the way initial fees from franchisees for new restaurant openings or new franchise terms are recognized. Under the new guidance, initial franchise fees will be recognized evenly over the franchise term. The Company expects the adoption of this guidance to negatively impact 2018 consolidated franchised revenues and franchised margins by approximately $50 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  With about 75% of McDonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company's commodity costs. For the full-year 2018, costs for the total basket of goods are expected to increase about 1% to 2% in the U.S. and increase about 2% in the International Lead segment. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects full-year 2018 selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease about 1% in constant currencies. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full-year 2018 to increase about 5% to 7% compared with 2017 due primarily to higher average debt balances. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  A significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 30 cents. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2018 to be in the 25-27% range, with volatility between the quarters. Certain aspects of the Tax Act are expected to be clarified, and as such, could impact the Company's tax rate. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects capital expenditures for 2018 to be approximately $2.4 billion. About $1.5 billion will be dedicated to our U.S. business, primarily focused on accelerating the pace of EOTF. We expect to complete EOTF at nearly 4,000 additional U.S. restaurants in 2018, ##TABLE_END McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 17 resulting in about half of the total U.S. restaurants modernized by the end of 2018. Of the remaining capital, about half will be dedicated to new restaurant openings and the remainder will be allocated to reinvestment in continued expansion of EOTF around the world. The Companys capital will contribute towards about 250 restaurant openings, while developmental licensees and affiliates will contribute capital towards the opening of approximately 750 restaurants, for a total of about 1,000 expected restaurant openings in 2018. The Company expects net additions of about 600 restaurants in 2018. Long-Term Outlook ##TABLE_START  The Company expects to realize net annual GA savings of about $500 million from its GA base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. Through the end of 2017, the Company realized cumulative savings of about $300 million and expects to fully realize its targeted $500 million of net savings in 2019. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects an incremental cash flow benefit of $400 to $500 million annually as a result of the Tax Act, prior to any reinvestment. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects to return about $24 billion to shareholders over the three-year period ending 2019. As the business grows, the Company also expects to modestly increase its debt levels, while maintaining its credit metrics within current ranges. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Beginning in 2019, the Company expects to achieve the following long-term, average annual (constant currency) financial targets: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Systemwide sales growth of 3-5%; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating margin in the mid-40% range; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Earnings per share growth in the high-single digits; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ROIIC in the mid-20% range. ##TABLE_END 18 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report Consolidated Operating Results ##TABLE_START Operating results           Dollars and shares in millions, except per share data  Amount  Increase/ (decrease)   Amount  Increase/ (decrease)   Amount Revenues             Sales by Company-operated restaurants  $ 12,719  (17 %)   $ 15,295  (7 %)   $ 16,488 Revenues from franchised restaurants  10,101    9,327    8,925 Total revenues  22,820  (7 )   24,622  (3 )   25,413 Operating costs and expenses             Company-operated restaurant expenses  10,410  (18 )   12,699  (9 )   13,977 Franchised restaurants-occupancy expenses  1,789    1,718    1,647 Selling, general  administrative expenses  2,231  (6 )   2,384  (2 )   2,434 Other operating (income) expense, net  (1,163 )  n/m    (64 )   Total operating costs and expenses  13,267  (21 )   16,877  (8 )   18,267 Operating income  9,553    7,745    7,146 Interest expense        Nonoperating (income) expense, net   n/m   (6 )    (48 ) Income before provision for income taxes  8,573    6,866    6,556 Provision for income taxes  3,381    2,180    2,027 Net income  $ 5,192  %   $ 4,686  %   $ 4,529 Earnings per common sharediluted  $ 6.37  %   $ 5.44  %   $ 4.80 Weighted-average common shares outstanding diluted  815.5  (5 %)   861.2  (9 %)   944.6 ##TABLE_ENDn/m Not meaningful IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonalds mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing goods and services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows. In 2017, results reflected the stronger Euro, offset by the weaker British Pound. In 2016 and 2015, results were negatively impacted by weaker foreign currencies. Impact of foreign currency translation on reported results ##TABLE_START      Reported amount      Currency translation benefit/(cost)  In millions, except per share data        Revenues  $ 22,820  $ 24,622  $ 25,413   $  $ (692 )  $ (2,829 ) Company-operated margins  2,309  2,596  2,511    (89 )  (331 ) Franchised margins  8,312  7,609  7,278    (118 )  (626 ) Selling, general  administrative expenses  2,231  2,384  2,434   (10 )   Operating income  9,553  7,745  7,146    (173 )  (771 ) Net income  5,192  4,686  4,529    (97 )  (473 ) Earnings per common sharediluted  6.37  5.44  4.80     (0.11 )  (0.50 ) ##TABLE_END NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE In 2017 , net income increased 11% ( 11% in constant currencies) to $5.2 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 17% ( 17% in constant currencies) to $6.37 . Foreign currency translation had no impact on diluted earnings per share. In 2016 , net income increased 3% (6% in constant currencies) to $4.7 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 13% (16% in constant currencies) to $5.44 . Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.11 on diluted earnings per share. Results in 2017 reflected stronger operating performance, GA savings and improved performance in Japan, which enabled the reversal of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in Japan. 2017 results included approximately $700 million of net tax cost associated with the Tax Act, reflecting provisional amounts related to the deemed repatriation charge of approximately $1.2 billion, partly offset by a benefit of approximately $500 million resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower enacted U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%. In addition to the $0.82 per share of net tax cost associated with the Tax Act, 2017 results included a net benefit of $0.53 per share consisting of an approximate $850 million gain on the sale of the Companys businesses in China and Hong Kong, offset in part by $150 million of current year restructuring and non-cash impairment charges in connection with the Companys global GA and refranchising initiatives. Excluding the above items, as well as $342 million of prior year strategic charges, net income was $5.4 billion, an increase of 10% (10% in constant currencies), and diluted earnings per share was $6.66, an increase of 16% (16% in constant currencies). Results in 2016 benefited from stronger operating performance and higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses, mostly in the U.S. Results in 2016 included $342 million, or $0.28 per share, of strategic charges.  McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 19 The Company repurchased 31.4 million shares of its stock for $4.6 billion in 2017 and 92.3 million shares of its stock for $11.1 billion in 2016 , driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share. REVENUES The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Between 2015 and 2017, the Company accelerated the pace of refranchising to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams, and operate with a less resource-intensive structure. The shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales are replaced by franchised sales, where the Company receives rent and/or royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales. In 2017 , revenues decreased 7% ( 8% in constant currencies) and in 2016 , revenues decreased 3% (flat in constant currencies). For both periods, the decreases in revenues were due to the impact of refranchising, partly offset by positive comparable sales. ##TABLE_START Revenues   Amount   Increase/(decrease)   Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation  Dollars in millions        Company-operated sales:               U.S.  $ 3,260  $ 3,743  $ 4,198  (13 %)  (11 %)  (13 %)  (11 %) International Lead Markets  4,080  4,278  4,798  (5 )  (11 )  (4 )  (6 ) High Growth Markets  4,592  5,378  5,442  (15 )  (1 )  (17 )  Foundational Markets  Corporate   1,896  2,050  (58 )  (8 )  (59 )  (5 ) Total  $ 12,719  $ 15,295  $ 16,488  (17 %)  (7 %)  (18 %)  (4 %) Franchised revenues:               U.S.  $ 4,746  $ 4,510  $ 4,361  %  %  %  % International Lead Markets  3,260  2,945  2,817     High Growth Markets        Foundational Markets  Corporate  1,154  1,089  1,016     Total  $ 10,102  $ 9,327  $ 8,925  %  %  %  % Total revenues:               U.S.  $ 8,006  $ 8,253  $ 8,559  (3 %)  (4 %)  (3 %)  (4 %) International Lead Markets  7,340  7,223  7,615   (5 )   (1 ) High Growth Markets  5,533  6,161  6,173  (10 )    (13 )  Foundational Markets  Corporate  1,941  2,985  3,066  (35 )  (3 )  (35 )  Total  $ 22,820  $ 24,622  $ 25,413  (7 %)  (3 %)  (8 %)   %                ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  US: In 2017 and 2016 , the decrease in revenues reflected the impact of refranchising, partly offset by positive comparable sales. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  International Lead Markets: In 2017 , the increase in revenues was due to strong performance in the U.K. and Canada as well as positive comparable sales across all markets, partly offset by the impact of refranchising. In 2016 , the decrease in revenues was due to the impact of refranchising, partly offset by strong comparable sales growth across most of the segment. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  High Growth Markets: In 2017 , the decrease in revenues reflected the impact of refranchising the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong, partly offset by positive comparable sales across most markets. In 2016 , revenue growth was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. In constant currencies, 2016 revenues increased due to positive comparable sales growth in China and most other markets, and expansion in Russia. ##TABLE_END20 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report The following tables present comparable sales, comparable guest counts and Systemwide sales increases/(decreases) : ##TABLE_START Comparable sales and guest count increases/(decreases)                  Sales  Guest Counts  Sales  Guest Counts  Sales  Guest Counts U.S.  3.6 %  1.0 %  1.7 %  (2.1 %)  0.5 %  (3.0 %) International Lead Markets  5.3  2.3  3.4  1.5  3.4  1.0 High Growth Markets  5.3  1.8  2.8  (0.8 )  1.8  (2.2 ) Foundational Markets  Corporate  9.0 * 3.3  10.0  1.9  0.7  (3.7 ) Total  5.3 % * 1.9 %  3.8 %  (0.3 %)  1.5 %  (2.3 %) ##TABLE_END* Beginning in 2017, the Company excluded sales from markets identified as hyper-inflationary (currently only Venezuela) from the comparable sales calculation as the Company believes this more accurately reflects the underlying business trends.

This increase was partly offset by negative comparable sales in South Korea and the impact of refranchising. In 2016 , the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales and improved restaurant profitability in China, which benefited from value-added tax (\"VAT\") reform, partly offset by higher labor costs across the segment. ##TABLE_END 22 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report SELLING, GENERAL  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 6% ( 7% in constant currencies) in 2017 and decreased 2% (1% in constant currencies) in 2016 .

Management believes that analyzing selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall McDonald's business. In connection with our turnaround plan, the Company established a net selling, general and administrative savings target of $500 million from its GA base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. The Company expects to fully realize its targeted $500 million of net savings in 2019. ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_ENDOTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET Other operating (income) expense, net ##TABLE_START In millions   Gains on sales of restaurant businesses $ (295 )  $ (283 )  $ (146 ) Equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates (184 )  (55 )  Asset dispositions and other (income) expense, net   (27 ) Impairment and other charges (gains), net (703 )   Total $ (1,163 )  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Gains on sales of restaurant businesses ##TABLE_END In 2017, gains on sales of restaurant businesses remained relatively flat.

In 2016, the increase reflected higher franchised margin dollars and higher gains from sales of restaurant businesses, partly offset by the negative impact from lapping the 2015 gain on the strategic sale of a unique restaurant property. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  International Lead Markets: In 2017 and 2016, the constant currency operating income increase was primarily due to sales-driven improvements in franchised margin dollars. In addition, 2017 benefited from a property disposition gain in Australia. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  High Growth Markets: In 2017, the constant currency operating income increase reflected higher franchise margin dollars due to sales-driven performance, the impact of refranchising and GA savings. In addition, results benefited from lower depreciation expense in China and Hong Kong, and also includes the gain on the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong as well as unrelated non-cash impairment charges. Excluding these items, operating income increased 17% (15% in constant currencies). In 2016, the increase was driven primarily by improved restaurant profitability in China. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Foundational Markets and Corporate: In 2017, the constant currency operating income increase reflected the Company's refranchising initiatives, higher GA costs at the Corporate level due to restaurant technology expenditures, and improved performance in Japan, which enabled the reversal of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in Japan. Results also reflected the benefit from comparison to the prior year's strategic charges. In 2016, the increase reflected Japan's strong performance, partly offset by the net impact of the current and prior year impairment and restructuring charges from the Company's global refranchising and restructuring initiatives. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating margin ##TABLE_END Operating margin was 41.9% in 2017 , 31.5% in 2016 and 28.1% in 2015 .

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES In 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the reported effective income tax rates were 39.4% , 31.7% and 30.9%, respectively. The increase in the tax rate for 2017 reflects provisional amounts related to the deemed repatriation charge of approximately $1.2 billion, partly offset by a benefit of approximately $500 million resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower enacted U.S. corporate tax rate of 21% under the Tax Act. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act, the effective income tax rate would have been 31.6%. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.5 billion in 2017 and $2.0 billion in 2016 . Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Recently issued accounting standards are included in Part II, Item 8, page 36 of this Form 10-K. 24 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report ##TABLE_START Cash Flows  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $5.6 billion and free cash flow was $3.7 billion in 2017, while cash provided by operations totaled $6.1 billion and free cash flow was $4.2 billion in 2016. The Company's free cash flow conversion rate was 71% in 2017, and 90% in 2016 (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12). In 2017, cash provided by operations decreased by $508 million or 8% compared with 2016, as improved operating results were more than offset by higher income tax payments in the U.S. and other working capital changes. In 2016, cash provided by operations decreased $480 million or 7% compared with 2015, primarily due to higher income tax payments primarily outside the U.S. and other working capital changes, partly offset by higher net income. Cash provided by investing activities totaled $562 million in 2017, an increase of $1.5 billion compared with 2016. The increase is primarily due to proceeds associated with the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong. Cash used for investing activities totaled $982 million in 2016, a decrease of $438 million compared with 2015. The decrease primarily reflected higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses. Cash used for financing activities totaled $5.3 billion in 2017, a decrease of $6 billion compared with 2016, primarily due to lower treasury stock purchases, partly offset by a decrease in net borrowings. Cash used for financing activities totaled $11.3 billion in 2016, an increase of $12.0 billion compared with 2015, primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings and higher treasury stock purchases. The Companys cash and equivalents balance was $2.5 billion and $1.2 billion at year end 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In 2017 , the Company opened 929 restaurants and closed 587 restaurants. In 2016 , the Company opened 896 restaurants and closed 522 restaurants. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.

Capital expenditures were relatively flat in 2017 as higher expenditures on restaurant reinvestment were offset by fewer restaurant openings that required the Company's capital. Under McDonald's developmental licensee and affiliate arrangements, licensees provide capital for the entire business and the Company generally has no capital invested. Capital expenditures in 2016 were essentially flat with 2015, primarily due to higher reinvestment related to reimages, offset by fewer new restaurant openings. Capital expenditures invested in the U.S., International Lead markets and High Growth markets represented over 90% of the total in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .

Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $3.9 million in 2017 . The Company owned 45% to 50% of the land and 70% to 75% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2017 and 2016. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS For 2017 through 2019, the Company expects to return about $24 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, subject to business and market conditions. In 2017, the Company returned approximately $7.7 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid. Shares repurchased and dividends  ##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data   Number of shares repurchased 31.4  92.3  61.8 Shares outstanding at year end   Dividends declared per share $ 3.83  $ 3.61  $ 3.44       Treasury stock purchases (in Shareholders' equity) $ 4,651  $ 11,142  $ 6,182 Dividends paid 3,089  3,058  3,230 Total returned to shareholders $ 7,740  $ 14,200  $ 9,412 ##TABLE_ENDIn December 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved a $15 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date (\"2016 Program\"). In July 2017, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the 2016 Program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program, effective July 28, 2017, that authorizes the purchase of up to $15 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. In 2017, approximately 31.4 million shares were repurchased for $4.7 billion, of which approximately 17.3 million shares or $2.7 billion were repurchased under the new program. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 42 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2017 full-year dividend of $3.83 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.94 per share, with an increase to $1.01 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 7% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a  McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 25 $4.04 per share annual dividend and reflects the Companys confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors. ##TABLE_START Financial Position and Capital Resources  ##TABLE_ENDTOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS Total assets increased $2.8 billion or 9% in 2017 primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates and an increase in cash and equivalents, partly offset by the impact of refranchising. Approximately 85% of total assets were in the U.S., International Lead markets and High Growth markets at year-end 2017. Net property and equipment increased $1.2 billion in 2017, primarily due to capital expenditures and the impact of foreign exchange rates, partly offset by depreciation and the impact of refranchising. Net property and equipment represented about 65% of total assets at year-end. Operating income and month-end asset balances are used to compute return on average assets. For the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015, return on average assets was 29.0%, 23.0% and 20.9%, respectively. In 2017, return on average assets increased primarily due to higher operating income, which included the gain on the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong. In 2016, return on average assets increased due to higher operating income and lower average assets. Operating income does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about three percentage points for all years presented. FINANCING AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2017 totaled $29.5 billion, compared with $26.0 billion at December 31, 2016. The net increase in 2017 was primarily due to net long-term issuances of $3.1 billion.

To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Under existing authorization from the Companys Board of Directors, at December 31, 2017 , the Company had $15.0 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $2.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2018 is $1.8 billion of long-term corporate debt. The Company plans to issue long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. As of December 31, 2017 , the Company's subsidiaries also had $268 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments. 26 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $12.4 billion and $8.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Companys restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2017 , the Company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to negative fair value of certain derivative positions. The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions. The Companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures ##TABLE_START In millions of U.S. Dollars  British Pounds Sterling $ 1,877  $ 1,340 Australian Dollars 1,519  1,393 Canadian Dollars  1,190 Japanese Yen  Russian Ruble  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2017 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2017 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. LIQUIDITY The Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where we earn about 60% of our operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings have been reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2017 . Consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company expects an incremental cash flow benefit of $400 to $500 million annually due to a reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% partly offset by a $1.2 billion 2017 tax cost on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings that will be paid over the next 8 years. In the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Companys borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2017 . See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details. ##TABLE_START  Contractual cash outflows   Contractual cash inflows  In millions Operating leases   Debt obligations (1)   Minimum rent under franchise arrangements   $ 1,152   $ 2,025   $ 2,893  1,087   2,121   2,813    2,432   2,707    1,717   2,577    2,311   2,441 Thereafter  6,912   19,057   20,330 Total  $ 11,857   $ 29,663   $ 33,761 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The maturities include reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $2.0 billion , as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in December 2019. Debt obligations do not include the impact of noncash fair value hedging adjustments, deferred debt costs, and accrued interest. ##TABLE_END In the U.S., the Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") limitations. At December 31, 2017 , total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $484 million . At December 31, 2017, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $1.2 billion . In addition, a liability of approximately $1.2 billion was recorded in 2017 resulting from the  McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 27 Tax Act, which imposed a deemed repatriation tax on the Company's undistributed foreign earnings. This tax liability will be paid over eight years beginning in 2018. There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature, will be funded from operating cash flows, and are not significant to the Companys overall financial position. ##TABLE_START Other Matters  ##TABLE_ENDCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: ##TABLE_START  Property and equipment ##TABLE_END Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. ##TABLE_START  Businesses Held for Sale ##TABLE_END Assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016 primarily consisted of balances related to businesses in China and Hong Kong. In December 2016, the Companys Board of Directors approved an agreement for the Company to sell its existing businesses in China and Hong Kong to a licensee. Based on this approval, the Company concluded that these markets were held for sale as of December 31, 2016 in accordance with the requirements of ASC 360 Property, Plant and Equipment. The Company completed the sale of these businesses on July 31, 2017. ##TABLE_START  Share-based compensation ##TABLE_END The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Companys stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. For performance-based RSUs granted beginning in 2016, the Company includes a relative Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. ##TABLE_START  Long-lived assets impairment review ##TABLE_END Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Companys experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Companys estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, approximately 5-10% of goodwill may be at risk of future impairment as the fair values of certain reporting units were not substantially in excess of their carrying amounts. ##TABLE_START  Litigation accruals ##TABLE_END In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. ##TABLE_START  Income taxes ##TABLE_END The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a 28 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. The most significant new developments in 2017 and 2016 are described below. In 2017 and 2016, the Company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior years by $144 million and $150 million, respectively. These increases primarily resulted from the evaluation of new information during the progression of tax audits in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions. As a result of this new information, the Company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits. See the Income Taxes footnote in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the related tax reconciliations. In 2015, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) that included certain disagreed transfer pricing adjustments related to the Companys U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. Also in 2015, the Company filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. During 2017, the Company received a response to its protest, and, as of December 31, 2017, is awaiting scheduling of an opening conference with IRS Appeals. The Company expects resolution on these issues in either 2018 or 2019. In 2017, the IRS completed its examination of the Companys U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. Although at December 31, 2017 the IRS had not yet issued its RAR for these years, when issued it is expected to result in the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 RAR. Consequently, it is expected that the transfer pricing matters for 2011 and 2012 will be addressed along with the 2009 and 2010 matters as part of the 2009-2010 appeal, such that resolution is expected in either 2018 or 2019. In December 2015, the European Commission opened a formal investigation directly with the Luxembourg government to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If this matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and the Company may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. As of December 31, 2017, no decision has been published with respect to this investigation. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with Topic 740 - Income Taxes of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. At December 31, 2017, the Company has not completed the accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act. However, as described below, the Company has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on the existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. For these items, a provisional net tax cost of approximately $700 million is recognized and is included as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations. Provisional amounts Deferred tax assets and liabilities: The Company remeasured certain U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. However, the Company is still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Act and refining the calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. A provisional amount was recorded related to the remeasurement of the deferred tax balance, resulting in a provision for income taxes benefit of approximately $500 million. Foreign tax effects: The one-time transition tax is based on the total post-1986 earnings and profits (\"EP\") that the Company had previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. A provisional amount was recorded for the one-time transition tax liability, resulting in a provision for income taxes cost of approximately $1.2 billion. The Company has not yet completed the calculation of the total post-1986 foreign EP. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when the calculation of post-1986 foreign EP and the amounts held in cash or other specified assets are finalized. Additionally, the provisional amount includes an estimate of foreign withholding taxes related to the EP subject to the transition tax. A provisional deferred tax liability has been recorded for temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. However, the Company is still evaluating how the Tax Act will affect the Companys accounting position related to the indefinite reinvestment of unremitted foreign earnings. During the measurement period, the Company may reflect adjustments to this provisional amount upon obtaining, preparing, and analyzing the necessary information to complete the accounting under ASC 740. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICESINFLATION The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.

McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 35 ##TABLE_START Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  ##TABLE_ENDSummary of Significant Accounting Policies NATURE OF BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants in the global restaurant industry. All restaurants are operated either by the Company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchise arrangements, and developmental licensees and foreign affiliates under license agreements. The following table presents restaurant information by ownership type: ##TABLE_START Restaurants at December 31,   Conventional franchised 21,366  21,559  21,147 Developmental licensed 6,945  6,300  5,529 Foreign affiliated 5,797  3,371  3,405 Franchised 34,108  31,230  30,081 Company-operated 3,133  5,669  6,444 Systemwide restaurants 37,241  36,899  36,525 ##TABLE_ENDThe results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees were not material either individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale. CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily McDonalds Japan and China) are accounted for by the equity method. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers, and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the variable interest entity consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented. ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Measurement Period - Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 On December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission's Office of the Chief Accountant published Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on reporting for accounting impacts of the recently enacted tax reform legislation. SAB 118 permits the Company to provide reasonable estimates for the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) and to report the effects as provisional amounts in its financial statements during a limited measurement period. Under SAB 118, the measurement period may not extend beyond one year from the enactment of the Tax Act. Derivatives and Hedging In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. ASU 2017-12 expands components of fair value hedging, specifies the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, and eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness. The Company anticipates it will early adopt ASU 2017-12 in 2018 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. The Company anticipates the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on its financial statements. Intangibles In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result, an impairment charge will be recorded based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company has not made a determination on if it will early adopt ASU 2017-04, but it does not expect an impact to the consolidated financial statements from the adoption. Income Taxes In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. The goal of this update is to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. ASU 2016-16 will impact the Companys consolidated balance sheet, resulting in a cumulative catch up adjustment within miscellaneous other assets. The adjustment is expected to be less than 1% of retained earnings as of December 31, 2017. The Company expects little to no impact on the consolidated statements of income and cash flows. Lease Accounting In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Most prominent among the amendments is the recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2019. At transition, the Company will recognize and measure leases using the required modified retrospective approach. The Company anticipates ASU 2016-02 will have a material impact to the consolidated balance sheet due to the significance of the Companys operating lease portfolio as described in Leasing Arrangements. The Company will elect an optional practical expedient to retain the current classification of leases, and, therefore, anticipates a minimal initial impact on the consolidated statement of income. The impact of ASU 2016-02 is non-cash in nature; as such, it will not affect the Companys cash flows. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and foreign affiliates. Sales by Company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis. The Company presents sales net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales 36 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and may include initial fees. Continuing rent and royalties are recognized in the period earned. For the periods presented, initial fees are recognized upon opening of a restaurant or granting of a new franchise term. In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance codified in Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, \"Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" which amends the guidance in former ASC 605, \"Revenue Recognition.\" The core principle of the standard is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received for those goods or services. The standard also calls for additional disclosures around the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company will adopt the standard effective January 1, 2018. The standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption (\"modified retrospective method\"). The Company has selected to apply the modified retrospective method. The Company has determined that this standard will not impact its recognition of revenue from Company-operated restaurants or its recognition of royalties from restaurants operated by franchisees or licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees, which are based on a percent of sales. The standard will change the manner in which the Company recognizes initial fees from franchisees for new restaurant openings or from new franchise terms. The Company's accounting policy through December 31, 2017 was to recognize initial franchise fees when a new restaurant opens or at the start of a new franchise term. In accordance with the new guidance, the initial franchise services are not distinct from the continuing rights or services offered during the term of the franchise agreement, and will therefore be treated as a single performance obligation. As such, beginning in January 2018, initial fees received will be recognized over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years. The cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded upon adoption is expected to consist of deferred revenue of approximately $ 600 million within long-term liabilities and approximately $ 150 million of additional deferred tax assets within miscellaneous other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company expects the adoption of this standard to negatively impact 2018 consolidated franchised revenues and franchised margins by approximately $ 50 million . No impact to the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows is expected as the initial fees will continue to be collected upon store opening date or the beginning of a new franchise term. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Generally, the functional currency of operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency. ADVERTISING COSTS Advertising costs included in operating expenses of Company-operated restaurants primarily consist of contributions to advertising cooperatives and were (in millions): 2017  $ 532.9 ; 2016  $ 645.8 ; 2015  $ 718.7 . Production costs for radio and television advertising are expensed when the commercials are initially aired. These production costs, primarily in the U.S., as well as other marketing-related expenses included in Selling, general  administrative expenses were (in millions): 2017  $ 100.2 ; 2016  $ 88.8 ; 2015  $ 113.8 . Costs related to the Olympics sponsorship are included in the expenses for 2016. In addition, significant advertising costs are incurred by franchisees through contributions to advertising cooperatives in individual markets. The costs incurred by these advertising cooperatives are approved and managed jointly by vote of both Company-operated restaurants and franchisees.  McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 37 SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Share-based compensation includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value. Share-based compensation expense and the effect on diluted earnings per common share were as follows: ##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data   Share-based compensation expense $ 117.5  $ 131.3  $ 110.0 After tax $ 82.0  $ 89.6  $ 76.0 Earnings per common share-diluted $ 0.10  $ 0.11  $ 0.08 ##TABLE_ENDCompensation expense related to share-based awards is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in Selling, general  administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2017 , there was $ 106.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for the 2017 , 2016 and 2015 stock option grants. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical trends. Expected stock price volatility is generally based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock for a period approximating the expected life. The expected dividend yield is based on the Companys most recent annual dividend rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life. Weighted-average assumptions ##TABLE_START  2016 Expected dividend yield 3.1 % 3.0 % 3.6 % Expected stock price volatility 18.4 % 19.2 % 18.8 % Risk-free interest rate 2.2 % 1.2 % 1.7 % Expected life of options (in years) 5.9 5.9 6.0 Fair value per option granted $ 16.10 $ 13.65 $ 10.43 ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date, less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. For performance-based RSUs granted beginning in 2016, the Company includes a relative Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildingsup to 40 years; leasehold improvements the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms , which generally include certain option periods; and equipment 3 to 12 years. LONG-LIVED ASSETS Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing McDonalds restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together in the U.S. at a television market level, and internationally, at a country level. The Company manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurants cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows. Losses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal and the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses related to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered available for sale.\" 38 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurant businesses. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of McDonald's restaurants from franchisees and ownership increases in subsidiaries or affiliates, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit (defined as each individual country) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit. The following table presents the 2017 activity in goodwill by segment: ##TABLE_START In millions U.S. International Lead Markets  High Growth Markets  Foundational Markets  Corporate  Consolidated  Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 1,283.3  $ 681.2  $ 280.1  $ 91.9  $ 2,336.5 Net restaurant purchases (sales) ( 9.3 )  2.5  0.7  ( 58.2 )  ( 64.3 ) Currency translation   66.8  35.9  4.8  107.5 Balance at December 31, 2017 $ 1,274.0  $ 750.5  $ 316.7  $ 38.5  $ 2,379.7 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company conducts goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever an indicator of impairment exists. If an indicator of impairment exists (e.g., estimated earnings multiple value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value), the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit, generally based on discounted future cash flows, with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the carrying amount of goodwill. Historically, goodwill impairment has not significantly impacted the consolidated financial statements. Accumulated impairment losses on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $ 14.5 million and $ 96.6 million , respectively.  McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 39 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, and certain non-financial assets and liabilities on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value disclosures are reflected in a three-level hierarchy, maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: ##TABLE_START  Level 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for an identical asset or liability in an active market. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for a similar asset or liability in an active market or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END Certain of the Companys derivatives are valued using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate observable market parameters, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates, classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. Derivative valuations incorporate credit risk adjustments that are necessary to reflect the probability of default by the counterparty or the Company.  ##TABLE_START  Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value ##TABLE_END The following tables present financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the valuation hierarchy as defined in the fair value guidance:  ##TABLE_START December 31, 2017       In millions Level 1*  Level 2  Carrying Value  Derivative assets $ 167.3  $ 0.6   $ 167.9 Derivative liabilities   $ ( 45.4 )   $ ( 45.4 )         December 31, 2016       In millions Level 1*  Level 2  Carrying Value  Derivative assets $ 134.3  $ 47.0   $ 181.3 Derivative liabilities   $ ( 5.6 )   $ ( 5.6 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Level 1 is comprised of derivatives that hedge market driven changes in liabilities associated with the Companys supplemental benefit plans. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis ##TABLE_END Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). For the year ended December 31, 2017 , the Company recorded fair value adjustments to its long-lived assets, primarily to property and equipment, based on Level 3 inputs which includes the use of a discounted cash flow valuation approach. ##TABLE_START  Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2017 , the fair value of the Companys debt obligations was estimated at $ 31.8 billion , compared to a carrying amount of $ 29.5 billion . The fair value was based on quoted market prices, Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. The carrying amount for both cash equivalents and notes receivable approximate fair value. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt and derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of these changes. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. The Company documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions, as well as all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items. The Companys derivatives that are designated for hedge accounting consist mainly of interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, and cross-currency swaps, and are classified as either fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. Further details are explained in the \"Fair Value,\" \"Cash Flow\" and \"Net Investment\" hedge sections. The Company also enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Further details are explained in the Undesignated Derivatives section. All derivatives (including those not designated for hedge accounting) are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity dates. Changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments are reflected as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") and/or current earnings. 40 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report The following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 : ##TABLE_START  Derivative Assets  Derivative Liabilities In millions Balance Sheet Classification    Balance Sheet Classification   Derivatives designated as hedging instruments         Foreign currency Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $ 0.5  $ 31.7  Accrued payroll and other liabilities  $ ( 31.0 )  $ ( 2.0 ) Interest rate Prepaid expenses and other current assets    1.0  Prepaid expenses and other current liabilities  ( 0.3 )   Foreign currency Miscellaneous other assets  0.1  2.5  Other long-term liabilities  ( 1.4 )  ( 0.1 ) Interest rate Miscellaneous other assets    1.7  Other long-term liabilities  ( 5.9 )  ( 1.6 ) Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments  $ 0.6  $ 36.9    $ ( 38.6 )  $ ( 3.7 ) Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments         Equity Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $   $ 134.3  Accrued payroll and other liabilities  $ ( 6.8 )  $ ( 1.9 ) Foreign currency Prepaid expenses and other current assets    10.1     Equity Miscellaneous other assets  167.3         Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments  $ 167.3  $ 144.4    $ ( 6.8 )  $ ( 1.9 ) Total derivatives  $ 167.9  $ 181.3    $ ( 45.4 )  $ ( 5.6 ) ##TABLE_ENDFair Value Hedges The Company enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure to changes in the fair values of certain liabilities. The Company's fair value hedges convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt by use of interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2017 , $ 1.8 billion of the Company's outstanding fixed-rate debt was effectively converted. All of the Companys interest rate swaps meet the shortcut method requirements. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying debt. No ineffectiveness has been recorded to net income related to interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the year ended December 31, 2017 . ##TABLE_START Derivatives in Hedging Relationships  Gain (Loss) Recognized In Earnings on Hedging Derivative  Gain (Loss) Recognized In Earnings on Hedged Items   In millions       Interest rate   $ ( 6.2 )  $ ( 1.8 )   $ 6.2  $ 1.8 ##TABLE_ENDCash Flow Hedges The Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. The types of cash flow hedges the Company enters into include interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, and cross currency swaps. The effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives are reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Ineffectiveness of hedges is recognized immediately in earnings. ##TABLE_START   Gain (Loss) Recognized in AOCI (Effective Portion)  Gain (Loss) Reclassified From AOCI Into Earnings (Effective Portion)  Gain (Loss) Recognized in Earnings (Amount Excluded from Effectiveness Testing and Ineffective Portion) Derivatives in Hedging Relationships       In millions          Foreign currency   $ ( 76.0 )  $ 28.6   $ ( 13.7 )  $ 24.6      Interest rate (1)        ( 0.5 )  ( 0.5 )         $ ( 76.0 )  $ 28.6   $ ( 14.2 )  $ 24.1   $   $  ##TABLE_END(1) The amount of gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI into earnings is recorded in interest expense .  McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 41 The Company periodically uses interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of floating-rate debt, including forecasted debt issuances, into fixed-rate debt. The agreements are intended to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies), the Company uses foreign currency forwards to hedge a portion of anticipated exposures. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the decline in value of future foreign denominated royalties is offset by gains in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in the value of future foreign denominated royalties is offset by losses in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards. The hedges cover the next 18 months for certain exposures and are denominated in various currencies. As of December 31, 2017 , the Company had derivatives outstanding with an equivalent notional amount of $ 761.7 million that were used to hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency denominated royalties. The Company recorded after tax adjustments to the cash flow hedging component of AOCI in shareholders equity. The Company recorded a decrease of $ 39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and an increase of $ 2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 . Based on interest rates and foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2017 , there is $ 16.5 million in after-tax cumulative cash flow hedging losses , which is not expected to have a significant effect on earnings over the next 12 months. Net Investment Hedges The Company primarily uses foreign currency denominated debt (third party and intercompany) to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in the foreign currency translation component of AOCI, as well as the offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are liquidated or sold. As of December 31, 2017 , $ 11.9 billion of third party foreign currency denominated debt and $ 3.6 billion of intercompany foreign currency denominated debt were designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. ##TABLE_START Derivatives in Hedging Relationships  Gain (Loss) Recognized in AOCI (Effective Portion)  In millions    Foreign currency denominated debt   $ ( 1,599.7 )  $ 654.9 Foreign currency derivatives   ( 8.9 )  9.9   $ ( 1,608.6 )  $ 664.8 ##TABLE_ENDUndesignated Derivatives The Company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting, therefore the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings together with the gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. As an example, the Company enters into equity derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Selling, general  administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in Nonoperating (income) expense, net, along with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. ##TABLE_START Derivatives Not Designated for Hedge Accounting  Gain (Loss) Recognized in Earnings  In millions    Foreign currency   $ ( 24.2 )  $ 4.3 Equity   92.7  26.0    $ 68.5  $ 30.3 ##TABLE_ENDCredit Risk The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its hedging instruments. The counterparties to these agreements consist of a diverse group of financial institutions and market participants. The Company continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and adjusts positions as appropriate. The Company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2017 , and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. For financial reporting purposes, the Company presents gross derivative balances in the financial statements and supplementary data, even for counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2017 , the Company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to negative fair value of certain derivative positions. The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions. INCOME TAXES Income Tax Uncertainties The Company, like other multi-national companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. Accordingly, tax liabilities are recorded when, in managements judgment, a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may still be recorded depending on managements assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled. The Company records interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\"GILTI\") The Tax Act requires a U.S. shareholder of a foreign corporation to include GILTI in taxable income. The accounting policy of the Company is to record any tax on GILTI in the provision for income taxes in the year it is incurred.  42 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION Diluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of shares): 2017  8.1 ; 2016  6.8 ; 2015  5.2 . Stock options that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutive were (in millions of shares): 2017  0.1 ; 2016  1.2 ; 2015  1.0 . CASH AND EQUIVALENTS The Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). There were no subsequent events that required recognition or disclosure. ##TABLE_START Property and Equipment  ##TABLE_ENDNet property and equipment consisted of: ##TABLE_START In millions December 31, 2017  Land $ 5,662.2  $ 5,465.0 Buildings and improvements on owned land 14,776.9  13,695.2 Buildings and improvements on leased land 12,509.2  11,511.9 Equipment, signs and seating 3,165.7  3,270.9 Other 512.4  500.4 Property and equipment, at cost 36,626.4  34,443.4 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 14,178.1 )  ( 13,185.8 ) Net property and equipment $ 22,448.3  $ 21,257.6 ##TABLE_ENDDepreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment was (in millions): 2017  $ 1,227.5 ; 2016  $ 1,390.7 ; 2015  $ 1,438.0 . ##TABLE_START Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START In millions   Gains on sales of restaurant businesses $ ( 295.4 )  $ ( 283.4 )  $ ( 145.9 ) Equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates ( 183.7 )  ( 54.8 )  146.8 Asset dispositions and other (income) expense, net 18.7  72.3  ( 26.6 ) Impairment and other charges (gains), net ( 702.8 )  341.6  235.1 Total $ ( 1,163.2 )  $ 75.7  $ 209.4 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Gains on sales of restaurant businesses ##TABLE_END The Companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses on sales of restaurant businesses are recorded in operating income because these transactions are a recurring part of our business. ##TABLE_START  Equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates ##TABLE_END Unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control. The Company records equity in (earnings) losses from these entities representing McDonalds share of results.

Charges associated with strategic initiatives, such as refranchising and restructuring activities are also included. In addition, as the Company continues to make progress towards its long-term global refranchising goals, the realized gains/losses from the sale of McDonald's businesses in certain markets are reflected in this category. In July 2017, the Company completed the sale of its businesses in China and Hong Kong, resulting in a gain of approximately $ 850 million . ##TABLE_START Contingencies  ##TABLE_ENDIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.  McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 43 ##TABLE_START Franchise Arrangements  ##TABLE_ENDConventional franchise arrangements generally include a lease and a license and provide for payment of initial fees, as well as continuing rent and royalties to the Company based upon a percent of sales with minimum rent payments that parallel the Companys underlying leases and escalations (on properties that are leased). Under this arrangement, franchisees are granted the right to operate a restaurant using the McDonalds System and, in most cases, the use of a restaurant facility, generally for a period of 20 years . These franchisees pay related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. Developmental licensees and affiliates operating under license agreements pay a royalty to the Company based upon a percent of sales, and may pay initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants consisted of: ##TABLE_START In millions   Rents $ 6,496.3  $ 6,107.6  $ 5,860.6 Royalties 3,518.7  3,129.9  2,980.7 Initial fees 86.5  89.4  83.4 Revenues from franchised restaurants $ 10,101.5  $ 9,326.9  $ 8,924.7 ##TABLE_ENDFuture gross minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements are: ##TABLE_START In millions Owned sites   Leased sites  Total  $ 1,420.1  $ 1,473.4  $ 2,893.5  1,389.9  1,423.3  2,813.2  1,353.8  1,352.8  2,706.6  1,306.1  1,271.3  2,577.4  1,253.9  1,187.0  2,440.9 Thereafter  10,841.3  9,488.4  20,329.7 Total minimum payments  $ 17,565.1  $ 16,196.2  $ 33,761.3 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2017 , net property and equipment under franchise arrangements totaled $ 16.5 billion (including land of $ 4.8 billion ) after deducting accumulated depreciation and amortization of $ 9.8 billion . ##TABLE_START Leasing Arrangements  ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2017 , the Company was the lessee at 12,262 restaurant locations through ground leases (the Company leases the land and the Company generally owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases land and buildings). Lease terms for most restaurants, where market conditions allow, are generally for 20 years and, in many cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options, with certain leases providing purchase options. Escalation terms vary by market with examples including fixed-rent escalations, escalations based on an inflation index, and fair-value market adjustments. The timing of these escalations generally ranges from annually to every five years . For most locations, the Company is obligated for the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance; however, for franchised sites, the Company requires the franchisees to pay these costs. In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-restaurant related leases such as offices, vehicles and office equipment.

At December 31, 2017, the Company has not completed the accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act. However, as described below, the Company has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on the existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. For these items, a net provisional tax cost of approximately $ 700 million is recognized and is included as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations. Provisional amounts Deferred tax assets and liabilities: The Company remeasured certain U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. However, the Company is still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Act and refining the calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. A provisional amount was recorded related to the remeasurement of the deferred tax balance, resulting in a provision for income taxes benefit of approximately $ 500 million . Foreign tax effects: The one-time transition tax is based on the total post-1986 earnings and profits (\"EP\") for which the Company had previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. A provisional amount was recorded for the one-time transition tax liability, resulting in a provision for income taxes cost of approximately $ 1.2 billion . The Company has not yet completed the calculation of the total post-1986 foreign EP. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when the calculation of post-1986 foreign EP and the amounts held in cash or other specified assets are finalized. The provision for income taxes, classified by the timing and location of payment, was as follows: ##TABLE_START In millions   U.S. federal $ 2,030.8  $ 1,046.6  $ 1,072.3 U.S. state 169.8  121.3  139.5 Outside the U.S. 1,217.0  1,550.2  816.0 Current tax provision 3,417.6  2,718.1  2,027.8 U.S. federal ( 120.1 )  ( 122.1 )  6.8 U.S. state 12.8  14.1  ( 3.9 ) Outside the U.S. 70.9  ( 430.6 )  ( 4.3 ) Deferred tax provision ( 36.4 )  ( 538.6 )  ( 1.4 ) Provision for income taxes $ 3,381.2  $ 2,179.5  $ 2,026.4 ##TABLE_ENDNet deferred tax liabilities consisted of: ##TABLE_START In millions December 31, 2017   Property and equipment   $ 1,211.5  $ 1,459.8 Unrealized foreign exchange gains     630.9 Intangible liabilities   296.2  445.2 Other   242.0  287.6 Total deferred tax liabilities   1,749.7  2,823.5 Property and equipment   ( 633.8 )  ( 650.2 ) Employee benefit plans   ( 253.1 )  ( 395.0 ) Intangible assets   ( 228.8 )  ( 170.7 ) Deferred foreign tax credits   ( 208.6 )  ( 316.8 ) Operating loss carryforwards   ( 71.1 )  ( 292.7 ) Other   ( 266.0 )  ( 338.6 ) Total deferred tax assets before valuation allowance   ( 1,661.4 )  ( 2,164.0 ) Valuation allowance   163.2  168.0 Net deferred tax liabilities   $ 251.5  $ 827.5 Balance sheet presentation:      Deferred income taxes   $ 1,119.4  $ 1,817.1 Other assets-miscellaneous   ( 867.9 )  ( 804.0 ) Liabilities of businesses held for sale    ( 185.6 ) Net deferred tax liabilities   $ 251.5  $ 827.5 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2017, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $ 0.3 billion , of which $ 0.2 billion has an indefinite carryforward. The remainder will expire at various dates from 2018 to 2031. The Company's effective income tax rate has been generally lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because non-U.S. income is generally subject to local statutory country tax rates that are below the 35 % U.S. statutory tax rate and reflect the impact of global transfer pricing. Beginning in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate to 21%. The statutory U.S. federal income tax rate reconciles to the effective income tax rates as follows: ##TABLE_START    Statutory U.S. federal income tax rate 35.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % State income taxes, net of related federal income tax benefit 1.2  1.5  1.6 Foreign income taxed at different rates ( 4.6 )  ( 6.5 )  ( 4.9 ) Transition tax 13.7     US net deferred tax liability remeasurement ( 6.0 )     Cash repatriation 0.3    ( 2.3 ) Other, net ( 0.2 )  1.7  1.5 Effective income tax rates 39.4 %  31.7 %  30.9 % ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the Companys gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $ 1.2 billion and $ 924.1 million , respectively. After considering the deferred tax accounting impact, it is expected that about $ 700 million of the total as of December 31, 2017 would favorably affect the effective tax rate if resolved in the Companys favor.  McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 45 The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START In millions  Balance at January 1 $ 924.1  $ 781.2 Decreases for positions taken in prior years ( 13.7 )  ( 37.1 ) Increases for positions taken in prior years 143.9  150.1 Increases for positions related to the current year 140.2  116.6 Settlements with taxing authorities ( 6.5 )  ( 17.7 ) Lapsing of statutes of limitations ( 7.6 )  ( 69.0 ) Balance at December 31 (1) $ 1,180.4  $ 924.1 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Of this amount, $ 1,132.3 million and $ 890.0 million are included in Other long-term liabilities for 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and $ 30.8 million and $ 9.0 million are included in Current liabilities - income taxes for 2017 and 2016, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet. The remainder is included in Deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet. ##TABLE_END In 2015, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) that included certain disagreed transfer pricing adjustments related to the Companys U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. Also in 2015, the Company filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. During 2017 the Company received a response to its protest, and, as of December 31, 2017, is awaiting scheduling of an opening conference with IRS Appeals. In 2017, the IRS completed its examination of the Companys U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. Although at December 31, 2017 the IRS had not yet issued its RAR for these years, when issued it is expected to result in the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 RAR. Consequently, it is expected that the transfer pricing matters for 2011 and 2012 will be addressed along with the 2009 and 2010 matters as part of the 2009-2010 appeal. The Company is also under audit in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions for matters primarily related to transfer pricing, and the Company is under audit in multiple state tax jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease up to $ 710 million within the next 12 months, of which up to $ 20 million could favorably affect the effective tax rate. This would be due to the possible settlement of the 2009-2012 IRS transfer pricing matters, completion of the aforementioned foreign and state tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions. In addition, it is reasonably possible that, as a result of audit progression in both the U.S. and foreign tax audits within the next 12 months, there may be new information that causes the Company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded. While the Company cannot estimate the impact that new information may have on our unrecognized tax benefit balance, it believes that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined under ASC 740. The Company operates within multiple tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2009. The Company had $ 155.3 million and $ 117.0 million accrued for interest and penalties at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalties related to tax matters of $ 34.9 million in 2017 , $ 41.7 million in 2016, and $ 21.1 million in 2015 , which are included in the provision for income taxes. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company has re-evaluated its assertion related to the indefinite reinvestment of unremitted foreign earnings and recorded a provisional deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. Although the Company has accrued certain amounts, the Company is still evaluating how the Tax Act will affect the Companys accounting position related to the indefinite reinvestment of unremitted foreign earnings. During the measurement period, the Company may reflect adjustments to this provisional amount upon obtaining, preparing, and analyzing the necessary information to complete the accounting under ASC 740. ##TABLE_START Employee Benefit Plans  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company's 401k Plan is maintained for U.S.-based employees and includes a 401(k) feature, as well as an employer match. The 401(k) feature allows participants to make pre-tax contributions that are matched each pay period (with an annual true-up) from shares released under the leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") and employer cash contributions. All current account balances, future contributions and related earnings can be invested in eight investment alternatives as well as McDonalds stock in accordance with each participants investment elections. Future participant contributions are limited to 20 % investment in McDonalds stock. Participants may choose to make separate investment choices for current account balances and future contributions. The Company also maintains certain nonqualified supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the 401k Plan because of IRS limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the 401k Plan. Total liabilities were $ 484.3 million at December 31, 2017 , and $ 464.9 million at December 31, 2016 , and were primarily included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of the liabilities. At December 31, 2017 , derivatives with a fair value of $ 167.3 million indexed to the Company's stock and a total return swap with a notional amount of $ 202.8 million indexed to certain market indices were included at their fair value in Miscellaneous other assets and Accrued payroll and other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in liabilities for these nonqualified plans and in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded primarily in Selling, general  administrative expenses. Changes in fair value of the derivatives indexed to the Companys stock are recorded in the income statement because the contracts provide the counterparty with a choice to settle in cash or shares. Total U.S. costs for the 401k Plan, including nonqualified benefits and related hedging activities, were (in millions): 2017  $ 19.3 ; 2016  $ 24.8 ; 2015  $ 24.0 . Certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. also offer profit sharing, stock purchase or other similar benefit plans. Total plan costs outside the U.S. were (in millions): 2017  $ 43.3 ; 2016  $ 46.0 ; 2015  $ 53.4 . The total combined liabilities for international retirement plans were $ 44.6 million and $ 65.6 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Other post-retirement benefits and post- employment benefits were immaterial. 46 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report ##TABLE_START Segment and Geographic Information  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants in the global restaurant industry.

McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 47 ##TABLE_START Debt Financing  ##TABLE_ENDLINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS At December 31, 2017 , the Company had a $ 2.5 billion line of credit agreement expiring in December 2019 with fees of 0.070 % per annum on the total commitment, which remained unused. Fees and interest rates on this line are based on the Companys long-term credit rating assigned by Moodys and Standard  Poors . In addition, the Company's subsidiaries had unused lines of credit that were primarily uncommitted, short-term and denominated in various currencies at local market rates of interest . The weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings was 2.5 % at December 31, 2017 (based on $ 268.0 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings) and 2.2 % at December 31, 2016 (based on $ 192.0 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings and $ 799.8 million of commercial paper). DEBT OBLIGATIONS The Company has incurred debt obligations principally through public and private offerings and bank loans. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions, and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. Under certain agreements, the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at par or at a premium over par. The Company has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt prior to maturity.

The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plans was 51.5 million at December 31, 2017 , including 31.0 million available for future grants. STOCK OPTIONS Stock options to purchase common stock are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Companys stock on the date of grant. Substantially all of the options become exercisable in four equal installments, beginning a year from the date of the grant, and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. Intrinsic value for stock options is defined as the difference between the current market value of the Companys stock and the exercise price. During 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $ 353.6 million , $ 184.9 million and $ 202.9 million , respectively. Cash received from stock options exercised during 2017 was $ 456.8 million and the tax benefit realized from stock options exercised totaled $ 111.0 million . The Company uses treasury shares purchased under the Companys share repurchase program to satisfy share-based exercises. A summary of the status of the Companys stock option grants as of December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , and changes during the years then ended, is presented in the following table: ##TABLE_START       Options Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price   Weighted- average remaining contractual life in years  Aggregate intrinsic value in millions   Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price   Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price  Outstanding at beginning of year 21.5   $ 92.25       21.9   $ 84.76  23.4   $ 77.99 Granted 4.0   128.74       4.3   117.10  4.3   97.33 Exercised ( 5.6 )   81.77       ( 4.0 )   75.30  ( 5.1 )   62.59 Forfeited/expired ( 1.0 )   118.38       ( 0.7 )   106.50  ( 0.7 )   96.76 Outstanding at end of year 18.9   $ 101.55  6.3   $ 1,331.4  21.5   $ 92.25  21.9   $ 84.76 Exercisable at end of year 11.3   $ 90.73  4.9   $ 917.8  13.4     13.4    ##TABLE_ENDRSUs RSUs generally vest 100 % on the third anniversary of the grant and are payable in either shares of McDonalds common stock or cash, at the Companys discretion. The fair value of RSUs granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. Separately, Company executives have been awarded RSUs that vest based on Company performance. For performance-based RSUs granted beginning in 2016, the Company includes a relative TSR modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.

The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: ##TABLE_START I. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START II. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START III. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ##TABLE_END There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may vary over time. Management assessed the design and effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on managements assessment using those criteria, as of December 31, 2017 , management believes that the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. Ernst  Young, LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 and the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 . Their reports are presented on the following pages. The independent registered public accountants and internal auditors advise management of the results of their audits, and make recommendations to improve the system of internal controls. Management evaluates the audit recommendations and takes appropriate action.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Business  ##TABLE_ENDMcDonalds Corporation, the registrant, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to herein as the Company. a. General For the year ended December 31, 2018 , there were no material changes to the Company's corporate structure or in its method of conducting business. The business was structured with segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth. Significant reportable segments included the United States (\"U.S.\"), International Lead Markets and High Growth Markets. In addition, throughout this report we present the Foundational Markets  Corporate segment, which includes markets in over 80 countries, as well as Corporate activities. As detailed in the Company's Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on September 24, 2018, the Company announced changes to its global operating structure, effective January 1, 2019. Refer to the Segment and Geographic Information section included in Part II, Item 8, page 49 of this Form 10-K for additional information. b. Narrative description of business ##TABLE_START  General ##TABLE_END The Company operates and franchises McDonalds restaurants, which serve a locally-relevant menu of quality food and beverages in more than 100 countries. McDonalds franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures - conventional franchise, developmental license or affiliate. The optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant, trading area or market (country) is based on a variety of factors, including the availability of individuals with the entrepreneurial experience and financial resources, as well as the local legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property ownership and franchising. We continually review our mix of Company-owned and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be approximately 95% franchised over the long term. The business relationship between McDonalds and its independent franchisees is supported by adhering to standards and policies and is of fundamental importance to overall performance and to protecting the McDonalds brand. The Company is primarily a franchisor, with approximately 93% of McDonald's restaurants currently owned and operated by independent franchisees. Franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of McDonalds global brand, operating system and financial resources. Directly operating McDonalds restaurants contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor. One of the strengths of the franchising model is that the expertise from operating Company-owned restaurants allows McDonalds to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and, when viable, efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants. Having Company-owned and operated restaurants provides Company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience. In addition, in our Company-owned and operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we are able to further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit McDonalds restaurants. Conventional Franchise Under a conventional franchise arrangement, the Company generally owns the land and building or secures a long-term lease for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment, signs, seating and dcor. The Company believes that ownership of real estate, combined with the co-investment by franchisees, enables us to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. Franchisees are also responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time. In addition, to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives, the Company frequently co-invests with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or their operating systems. These investments, developed in collaboration with franchisees are designed to cater to consumer preferences, improve local business performance, and increase the value of our brand through the development of modernized, more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants. The Companys typical franchise term is 20 years. The Company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors. The business relationship with franchisees is designed to facilitate consistency and high quality at all McDonalds restaurants. Conventional franchisees contribute to the Companys revenue, primarily through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees paid upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new franchise. This structure enables McDonalds to generate significant levels of cash flow. Developmental License or Affiliate Under a developmental license or affiliate arrangement, licensees are responsible for operating and managing the business, providing capital (including the real estate interest) and developing and opening new restaurants. The Company generally does not invest any capital under a developmental license or affiliate arrangement, and it receives a royalty based upon a percent of sales and generally will receive initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new term. While developmental license and affiliate arrangements are largely the same, affiliate arrangements are used in a limited number of foreign markets where the Company also has an equity investment and records its share of net results in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. ##TABLE_START  Supply chain, food safety, and quality assurance ##TABLE_END The Company and its franchisees purchase food, packaging, equipment and other goods from numerous independent suppliers. The Company has established and enforces high food safety and quality standards. The Company has quality centers around the world designed to promote consistency of its high standards. The quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews, but also  McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 1 on-site supplier visits. A Food Safety Advisory Council, composed of the Companys internal food safety experts, as well as suppliers and outside academia, provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food safety. We have ongoing programs to educate employees about food safety practices, and our suppliers and restaurant operators participate in food safety trainings where we share best practices on food safety and quality. In addition, the Company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation and drive continuous improvement. Leveraging scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies, the Company also collaborates with suppliers toward a goal of achieving competitive, predictable food and paper costs over the long term. Independently owned and operated distribution centers, approved by the Company, distribute products and supplies to McDonalds restaurants. In addition, restaurant personnel are trained in the proper storage, handling and preparation of food for customers. ##TABLE_START  Products ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu, although there are geographic variations to suit local consumer preferences and tastes. In addition, McDonalds tests new products on an ongoing basis. McDonalds menu includes hamburgers and cheeseburgers, Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Filet-O-Fish, several chicken sandwiches, Chicken McNuggets, wraps, french fries, salads, oatmeal, shakes, McFlurry desserts, sundaes, soft serve cones, pies, soft drinks, coffee, McCaf beverages and other beverages. In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of other products during limited-time promotions. McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. and many international markets offer a full or limited breakfast menu. Breakfast offerings may include Egg McMuffin, Sausage McMuffin with Egg, McGriddles, biscuit and bagel sandwiches and hotcakes. Quality, choice and nutrition are increasingly important to our customers and we are continuously evolving our menu to meet our customers' needs. ##TABLE_START  Marketing ##TABLE_END McDonalds global brand is well known. Marketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed to promote McDonalds brand and differentiate the Company from competitors. Marketing and promotional efforts focus on value, quality, food taste, menu choice, nutrition, convenience and the customer experience. ##TABLE_START  Intellectual property ##TABLE_END The Company owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information. The Company considers the trademarks McDonalds and The Golden Arches Logo to be of material importance to its business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. Patents, copyrights and licenses are of varying durations. ##TABLE_START  Seasonal operations ##TABLE_END The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree. ##TABLE_START  Working capital practices ##TABLE_END Information about the Companys working capital practices is incorporated herein by reference to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 in Part II, Item 7, pages 15 through 31, and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 in Part II, Item 8, page 35 of this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START  Customers ##TABLE_END The Companys business is not dependent upon either a single customer or small group of customers. ##TABLE_START  Backlog ##TABLE_END Company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders. ##TABLE_START  Government contracts ##TABLE_END No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at government election. ##TABLE_START  Competition ##TABLE_END McDonalds restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of food products. The Company competes on the basis of price, convenience, service, menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry. In measuring the Companys competitive position, management reviews data compiled by Euromonitor International, a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry. The Companys primary competition, which is referred to as the informal eating out (\"IEO\") segment, includes the following restaurant categories defined by Euromonitor International: quick-service eating establishments, casual dining full-service restaurants, street stalls or kiosks, cafs,100% home delivery/takeaway providers, specialist coffee shops, self-service cafeterias and juice/smoothie bars. The IEO segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and full-service restaurants other than casual dining. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the global IEO segment was composed of approximately 9 million outlets and generated $1.3 trillion in annual sales in 2017 , the most recent year for which data is available. McDonalds Systemwide 2017 restaurant business accounted for 0.4% of those outlets and 7.1% of the sales. Management also on occasion benchmarks McDonalds against the entire restaurant industry, including the IEO segment defined above and all other full-service restaurants. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 19 million outlets and generated $2.5 trillion in annual sales in 2017 . McDonalds Systemwide restaurant business accounted for 0.2% of those outlets and 3.7% of the sales. McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 2 ##TABLE_START  Environmental matters ##TABLE_END The Company continuously endeavors to improve its social responsibility and environmental practices to achieve long-term sustainability, which benefits McDonalds and the communities it serves. Increased focus by certain governmental authorities on environmental matters may lead to new governmental initiatives. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. Although the impact would likely vary by world region and/or market, we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs for the Company. Also, there is a possibility that governmental initiatives, or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns, climate, or water resources, could have a direct impact on the operations of the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the \"System\") in ways which we cannot predict at this time. The Company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner. In addition, the Company launched its Scale for Good framework in 2018, which includes the environmental-related pillars of climate action, packaging and recycling, and sustainable sourcing. These include goals and initiatives to reduce System greenhouse gas emissions, responsibly source ingredients and packaging, and increase the availability of recycling in restaurants to reduce waste. ##TABLE_START  Number of employees ##TABLE_END The Companys number of employees worldwide, including its corporate office employees and Company-owned and operated restaurant employees, was approximately 210,000 as of year-end 2018 . c.

Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements. Our business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are reflected in the following considerations and factors, as well as elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. If any of these considerations or risks materialize, our expectations may change and our performance may be adversely affected. If we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, including under the Velocity Growth Plan, we may not be able to increase operating income. To drive operating income growth, our business strategies must be effective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal, delivering sustainable guest count growth and driving a higher average check. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our Systems ability to: ##TABLE_START  Continue to innovate and differentiate the McDonalds experience, including by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Capitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to enhance our ability to retain, regain and convert key customer groups; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Utilize our new organizational structure to build on our progress and execute against our business strategies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Augment our digital and delivery initiatives, including mobile ordering, along with Experience of the Future (EOTF), particularly in the U.S.; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants; ##TABLE_END McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 3 ##TABLE_START  Operate restaurants with high service levels and optimal capacity while managing the increasing complexity of our restaurant operations and create efficiencies through innovative use of technology; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Accelerate our existing strategies through growth opportunities, investments and partnerships. ##TABLE_END If we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Our investments to enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected returns. Our long-term business objectives depend on the successful Systemwide execution of our strategies. We continue to build upon our investments in EOTF, which focus on restaurant modernization and technology, as well as digital engagement and delivery, in order to transform the customer experience. As part of these investments, we are placing renewed emphasis on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives, as well as mobile ordering and payment systems. We also continue to refine our delivery initiatives and partnerships, which may not generate expected returns. If these initiatives are not well executed, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our business results may suffer. If we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing, promotional and marketing plans, our business could suffer. Our continued success depends on our Systems ability to retain, regain and convert customers. In order to do so, we need to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics, and trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food offerings and consumer preferences in the informal eating out (IEO) segment. If we are not able to quickly and effectively respond to these changes, or our competitors respond more effectively, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Our ability to retain, regain and convert customers also depends on the impact of pricing, promotional and marketing plans across the System, and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer preferences, as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions. Existing or future pricing strategies, and the value proposition they represent, are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy; however, they may not be successful in retaining, regaining and converting customers, or may not be as successful as the efforts of our competitors, and could negatively impact sales, guest counts and market share. Additionally, we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful in retaining, regaining and converting customers. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels allows us to reach our customers effectively. If the advertising and marketing programs are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease. Failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results. To be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brand. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions. Those perceptions are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, our business practices and the manner in which we source the commodities we use. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the IEO segment or perceptions of our brand generally or relative to available alternatives. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by adverse commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the IEO segment, our brand, our operations, our suppliers or our franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary, whether or not accurate, our brand and our financial results may suffer. Additionally, the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our sustainability initiatives, which require Systemwide coordination and alignment. If we are not effective in addressing social and environmental responsibility matters or achieving relevant sustainability goals, consumer trust in our brand may suffer. In particular, business incidents or practices whether actual or perceived, that erode consumer trust or confidence, particularly if such incidents or practices receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results. We face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business. We compete primarily in the IEO segment, which is highly competitive. We also face sustained, intense competition from traditional, fast casual and other competitors, which may include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores, grocery stores and coffee shops. We expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive, and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by new or continuing actions of our competitors, which may have a short- or long-term impact on our results. We compete on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. In particular, we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, develop new products, price our products appropriately, deliver a relevant customer experience, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations and respond effectively to our competitors actions or disruptive actions from others which we do not foresee. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics, which could have the overall effect of harming our business. McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 4 Unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions, which can vary significantly by market and can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits. Economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including hostilities, epidemics and actions taken by governments to manage national and international economic matters, whether through austerity, stimulus measures or trade measures, and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers. Sustained adverse economic conditions or periodic adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could pressure our operating performance, and our business and financial results may suffer. Our results of operations are also affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and unfavorable currency fluctuations could adversely affect reported earnings. Supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues. We depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient supply of quality products on favorable terms. Although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain products have limited suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers. Supply chain interruptions, including shortages and transportation issues, and price increases can adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. Such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers, franchisees or us. If we experience interruptions in our Systems supply chain, our costs could increase and it could limit the availability of products critical to our Systems operations. Food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business. Our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our Systems ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonalds of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future. Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to offer safe food products to our customers, including as our menu and service model evolve. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, occur within the food industry and our System from time to time and, in addition, could occur in the future. Instances of food tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our brand and reputation as well as our revenues and profits. Our franchise business model presents a number of risks. As the Company's business model has evolved to a more heavily franchised structure, our success relies to large degree on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, including our developmental licensees and affiliates. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from Company-operated restaurants. Our franchisees and developmental licensees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. Business risks affecting our operations also affect our franchisees. If our franchisees do not experience sales growth, our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result. Also, if sales trends worsen for franchisees, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, restaurant closures, or delayed or reduced payments to us. Our success also relies on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general, by the creditworthiness of our franchisees or the Company or by banks lending practices. If our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in major initiatives or are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brands image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results. Our ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex. The benefits of our more heavily franchised structure depends on various factors including whether we have effectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or affiliates that meet our rigorous standards, whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our structure and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives. Challenges with respect to talent management could harm our business. Effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Failure to effectively identify, develop and retain key personnel, recruit high-quality candidates and facilitate smooth management and personnel transitions could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results.  McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 5 Challenges with respect to labor availability and cost could impact our business and results of operations. Our success depends in part on our Systems ability to proactively recruit, motivate and retain a qualified workforce to work in our restaurants in an intensely competitive environment. Increased costs associated with recruiting, motivating and retaining qualified employees to work in our Company-operated restaurants could have a negative impact on our Company-operated margins. Similar concerns apply to our franchisees. We are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and international regulations affecting our workforce, which includes our staff and employees working in our Company-operated restaurants. These regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues, including wage and hour, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. Claims of non-compliance with these regulations could result in liability and expense to us. Our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers (or perceptions thereof) could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business. Additionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to recruit and retain talent) or the franchisees and suppliers that are also part of the McDonald's System and whose performance may have a material impact on our results. Information technology system failures or interruptions, or breaches of network security, may impact our operations. We are increasingly reliant on technological systems, such as point-of-sale and other systems or platforms, technologies supporting McDonalds digital and delivery solutions, as well as technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration internally, with affiliated entities, customers, employees or independent third parties to conduct our business, including technology-enabled systems provided to us by third parties. Any failure of these systems could significantly impact our operations and customer experience and perceptions. Despite the implementation of security measures, those technology systems and solutions could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Our increasing reliance on third party systems also present the risks faced by the third partys business, including the operational, security and credit risks of those parties. If those systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we could experience an interruption in our operations. Furthermore, security breaches have from time to time occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems, the systems of the parties we communicate or collaborate with (including franchisees), or those of third party providers. These may include such things as unauthorized access, denial of service, computer viruses, introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Our information technology systems contain personal, financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our customers, our employees and other third parties, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. An actual or alleged security breach could result in disruptions, shutdowns, theft or unauthorized disclosure of personal, financial, proprietary or other confidential information. Further, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires entities processing the personal data of individuals in the European Union to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of that data. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in substantial penalties and materially adversely impact our financial results. The occurrence of any of these incidents could result in reputational damage, adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, complications in executing our growth initiatives and regulatory and legal risk, including criminal penalties or civil liabilities. The global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business. We encounter differing cultural, regulatory and economic environments within and among the more than 100 countries where McDonalds restaurants operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on the System's success in these environments. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our Systems ability to leverage operating successes across markets and brand perceptions. Planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with McDonald's customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts. Disruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or changes in trade-related tariffs or controls, sanctions and counter sanctions, government-mandated closure of our franchisees or our suppliers operations, and asset seizures. The cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or inquiries, whether or not they have merit, or the impact of these other measures, may impact our results and could cause reputational or other harm. Our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brand-building initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental investigations or inquiries. Additionally, challenges and uncertainties are associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. Such challenges may be exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. An inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We may also face challenges and uncertainties in developed markets. For example, as a result of the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union through a negotiated exit over a period of time, including its formal commencement of exit proceedings, it is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities, as well as potential referenda in the U.K. and/or other European countries, that could cause uncertainty in European or worldwide economic conditions. The decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates that may or may not continue. Any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 6 Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world. In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or policy or related authoritative interpretations. We are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by taxing and governmental authorities inside and outside of the U.S. in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. Any significant increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations. The profitability of our Company-operated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, including food, paper, supplies, fuel, utilities and distribution, and other operating costs, including labor. Any volatility in certain commodity prices or fluctuation in labor costs could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability. The commodity markets for some of the ingredients we use, such as beef and chicken, are particularly volatile due to factors such as seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, international commodity markets, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulation, all of which are beyond our control and, in many instances, unpredictable. We can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities, and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Increasing regulatory complexity may adversely affect restaurant operations and our financial results. Our regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. We are affected by the cost, compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face, including where inconsistent standards imposed by multiple governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings. Our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of new, potential or changing regulations that can affect our business plans and operations. These regulations include product packaging, marketing, the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices. Compliance efforts with those regulations may be affected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers (particularly given varying requirements and practices for testing and disclosure). Additionally, we are working to manage the risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources. These risks include the increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, such as packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. These risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them. These risks could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us. Increasing legal complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. We could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations and proceedings, employment and personal injury claims, landlord/tenant disputes, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former franchisees and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another partys trademarks, copyrights or patents). Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management's attention away from operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to regulatory proceedings or litigation. Litigation and regulatory action concerning our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law purposes, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact our business operations and the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. Similarly, although our commercial relationships with our suppliers remain independent, there may be attempts to challenge that independence, which, if determined adversely, could also increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our suppliers, and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. We are also subject to legal and compliance risks and associated liability, such as in the areas of privacy and data collection, protection and management, as it relates to information associated with our technology-related services and platforms made available to business partners, customers, employees or other third parties. Our results could also be affected by the following: ##TABLE_START  The relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The cost and other effects of settlements, judgments or consent decrees, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The scope and terms of insurance or indemnification protections that we may have. ##TABLE_END McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 7 A judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage or third party indemnity could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from claims may hurt our business. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately confirm we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the McDonalds brand and our business. The success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products. We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately confirm that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. In particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business. We cannot guarantee that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property. Changes in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future operations and results. New accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results. We may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings. In assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, consumer and demographic trends, and our restructuring activities. If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. If we experience any such changes, they could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods. A decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability. Our credit ratings may be negatively affected by our results of operations or changes in our debt levels. As a result, our interest expense, the availability of acceptable counterparties, our ability to obtain funding on favorable terms, collateral requirements and our operating or financial flexibility could all be negatively affected, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants. Our operations may also be impacted by regulations affecting capital flows, financial markets or financial institutions, which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs. If any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Trading volatility and price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors. Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these factors, some of which are outside our control, are the following: ##TABLE_START  The unpredictable nature of global economic and market conditions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the U.S., which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can be affected by market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete); unauthorized disclosures about our performance, plans or expectations about our business; our actual performance and creditworthiness; investor confidence, driven in part by expectations about our performance; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonalds may be included, such as the SP 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact of our stock repurchase program or dividend rate; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The impact on our results of corporate actions and market and third-party perceptions and assessments of such actions, such as those we may take from time to time as we implement our strategies in light of changing business, legal and tax considerations and evolve our corporate structure. ##TABLE_ENDMcDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 8 Events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others, can adversely affect our results and prospects. Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels and supply availability and costs, as well as the local operations in impacted markets, all of which can affect our results and prospects. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses fully. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments  ##TABLE_ENDNone. ##TABLE_START ", "2": " ITEM 2. Properties  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company owns and leases real estate primarily in connection with its restaurant business. The Company identifies and develops sites that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential to the System. To assess potential, the Company analyzes traffic and walking patterns, census data and other relevant data. The Companys experience and access to advanced technology aid in evaluating this information. The Company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for conventional franchised and Company-operated restaurant sites, which facilitates long-term occupancy rights and helps control related costs. Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to control average development costs through construction and design efficiencies, standardization and by leveraging the Companys global sourcing network. In addition, the Company owns and leases real estate in connection with its corporate headquarters and field offices. Additional information about the Companys properties is included in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7, pages 15 through 31 and in Financial statements and supplementary data in Part II, Item 8, pages 31 through 52 of this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START ", "3": " ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company has pending a number of lawsuits that have been filed in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover a broad variety of allegations spanning the Companys entire business. The following is a brief description of the more significant types of claims and lawsuits. In addition, the Company is subject to various national and local laws and regulations that impact various aspects of its business, as discussed below. While the Company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, unfavorable rulings could occur. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on net income for the period in which the ruling occurs or for future periods. ##TABLE_START  Franchising ##TABLE_END A substantial number of McDonalds restaurants are franchised to independent owner/operators under contractual arrangements with the Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company and its current or former franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects including, but not limited to, quality, service and cleanliness issues, menu pricing, contentions regarding grants or terminations of franchises, delinquent payments of rents and fees, and franchisee claims for additional franchises or renewals of franchises. Additionally, occasional disputes arise between the Company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a McDonalds franchise or who challenge the legal distinction between the Company and its franchisees for employment law purposes. ##TABLE_START  Suppliers ##TABLE_END The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries generally do not supply food, paper or related items to any McDonalds restaurants. The Company relies upon numerous independent suppliers, including service providers, that are required to meet and maintain the Companys high standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company and its suppliers (or former suppliers) which include, for example, compliance with product specifications and the Companys business relationship with suppliers. In addition, disputes occasionally arise on a number of issues between the Company and individuals or entities who claim that they should be (or should have been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the Companys restaurants. ##TABLE_START  Employees ##TABLE_END Hundreds of thousands of people are employed by the Company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities  ##TABLE_ENDMARKET INFORMATION AND DIVIDEND POLICY The Companys common stock trades under the symbol MCD and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange in the U.S. The number of shareholders of record and beneficial owners of the Companys common stock as of January 31, 2019 was estimated to be 2,150,000 . Given the Companys returns on incremental invested capital and significant cash provided by operations, management believes it is prudent to reinvest in the business in markets with acceptable returns and/or opportunity for long-term growth and use excess cash flow to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The Company has paid dividends on common stock for 43 consecutive years through 2018 and has increased the dividend amount at least once every year. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors.

McDonald's is included in published restaurant indices; however, unlike most other companies included in these indices, which have no or limited international operations, McDonald's does business in more than 100 countries and a substantial portion of our revenues and income is generated outside the U.S. In addition, because of our size, McDonald's inclusion in those indices tends to skew the results. Therefore, we believe that such a comparison is not meaningful. Our market capitalization, trading volume and importance in an industry that is vital to the U.S. economy have resulted in McDonald's inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) since 1985. Like McDonald's, many DJIA companies generate meaningful revenues and income outside the U.S. and some manage global brands. Thus, we believe that the use of the DJIA companies as the group for comparison purposes is appropriate. The following performance graph shows McDonald's cumulative total shareholder returns (i.e., price appreciation and reinvestment of dividends) relative to the Standard  Poor's 500 Stock Index (SP 500 Index) and to the DJIA companies for the five-year period ended December 31, 2018 . The graph assumes that the value of an investment in McDonald's common stock, the SP 500 Index and the DJIA companies (including McDonald's) was $100 at December 31, 2013 . For the DJIA companies, returns are weighted for market capitalization as of the beginning of each period indicated. These returns may vary from those of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, which is not weighted by market capitalization, and may be composed of different companies during the period under consideration. ##TABLE_START Company/Index 12/31/2013 12/31/2014 12/31/2015 12/31/2016 12/31/2017 12/31/2018 McDonald's Corporation $100 $100 $130 $138 $201 $212 SP 500 Index 114 129 150 Dow Jones Industrials 110 128 159 ##TABLE_ENDSource: SP Capital IQ  McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 13 ##TABLE_START ", "6": " ITEM 6.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  ##TABLE_ENDOverview DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS The Company operates and franchises McDonalds restaurants. Of the 37,855 restaurants in 120 countries at year-end 2018 , 35,085 were franchised. Under McDonalds conventional franchise arrangement, the Company generally owns the land and building or secures a long-term lease for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment, signs, seating and dcor. The Company believes that ownership of real estate, combined with the co-investment by franchisees, enables us to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. Franchisees are also responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time. In addition, to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives, the Company frequently co-invests with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or their operating systems. These investments, developed in collaboration with franchisees are designed to cater to consumer preferences, improve local business performance, and increase the value of our brand through the development of modernized, more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants. Under McDonald's developmental license or affiliate arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company generally has no capital invested. The Company also has an equity investment in a limited number of foreign affiliates (primarily in China and Japan). McDonald's is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. Franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment-related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of McDonald's global brand, operating system and financial resources. Directly operating McDonalds restaurants contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor. One of the strengths of the franchising model is that the expertise from operating Company-owned restaurants allows McDonalds to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and, when viable, efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants. Having Company-owned and operated restaurants provides Company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience. In addition, in our Company-owned and operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we are able to further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit McDonalds restaurants. McDonald's continually reviews its mix of Company-operated and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be approximately 95% franchised over the long term. The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from developmental licensees and affiliate restaurants include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. Through the end of 2018, the business was structured into the following segments that combined markets with similar characteristics and ownership structure, and reflected how management reviewed and evaluated operating performance: ##TABLE_START  U.S. - the Company's largest segment. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  International Lead Markets - established markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the U.K. and related markets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  High Growth Markets - markets that the Company believes have relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential including China, Italy, Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, Switzerland and related markets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Foundational Markets  Corporate - the remaining markets in the McDonald's system, most of which operate under a largely franchised model. Corporate activities are also reported within this segment. ##TABLE_END Beginning in 2019, the Company changed its global operating structure as detailed in the Company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 24, 2018. Refer to the Strategic Direction and Financial Performance section on the next page for additional information as well as the Segment and Geographic Information section included in Part II, Item 8, page 49 of this Form 10-K. MANAGEMENT'S VIEW OF THE BUSINESS In analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures which are considered to be non-GAAP, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, return on incremental invested capital (\"ROIIC\"), free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below. ##TABLE_START  Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases most incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents its underlying business trends. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the Companys initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation, and, beginning in 2017, also exclude sales from Venezuela due to its hyper-inflation. Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative ##TABLE_END McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 15 inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Typically, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. The goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. ##TABLE_START  Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Companys financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Companys ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. ##TABLE_END STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the \"System\") is key to McDonald's long-term success. By leveraging the System, McDonalds is able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. McDonald's continually builds on its competitive advantages of System alignment and geographic diversification to deliver consistent, yet locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers as an integral part of their communities. In 2018, the Company continued to evolve to a more heavily franchised business model, and is currently about 93% franchised, with a long-term goal of approximately 95%. The Company will continue to make progress toward this long-term goal in 2019 primarily by refranchising restaurants to conventional licensees. As a result of the continued evolution of the Companys business model, in September 2018, the Company announced several organizational changes to its global business structure. These changes are designed to continue the Company's efforts toward efficiently driving growth as a better McDonalds through the Velocity Growth Plan. Effective January 1, 2019, McDonalds is operating with the following global business segments: ##TABLE_START  U.S., the Company's largest market. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  International Operated Markets (IOM), comprised of wholly-owned markets, or countries in which the Company operates restaurants, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain and the U.K. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  International Developmental Licensed Markets (IDL), comprised primarily of developmental licensee and affiliate markets in the McDonalds system. Corporate activities will also be reported within this segment. ##TABLE_END Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the U.K. may be collectively referred to as the Big Five international markets in the Companys disclosures. CUSTOMER-CENTRIC GROWTH STRATEGY The Velocity Growth Plan (the \"Plan\"), the Companys customer-centric strategy, is rooted in extensive customer research and insights, along with a deep understanding of the key drivers of the business. The Plan is designed to drive sustainable guest count growth, which is a reliable long-term measure of the Company's strength and is vital to growing sales and shareholder value. 2018 was a year of broad-based strength around the world along with significant execution against the Plan in the U.S. While the Company made meaningful progress, our focus in 2019 will be to optimize execution of the Plan to unlock further potential and drive long-term sustainable growth. The Company continues to target the opportunity at the core of its business - its food, value and customer experience. The strategy is built on the following three pillars, all focusing on building a better McDonalds: ##TABLE_START  Retaining existing customers - focusing on areas where it already has a strong foothold in the IEO category, including family occasions and food-led breakfast. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Regaining customers who visit less often - recommitting to areas of historic strength, namely food taste and quality, convenience and value. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Converting casual to committed customers - building stronger relationships with customers so they visit more often, by elevating and leveraging the McCaf coffee brand and enhancing snack and treat offerings. ##TABLE_END In each pillar, McDonalds has established sustainable platforms that enable execution of the Plan with greater speed, efficiency and impact while remaining relentlessly focused on the fundamentals of running great restaurants. Additionally, through three identified growth accelerators - Experience of the Future (EOTF), digital and delivery - McDonalds is enhancing the overall customer experience with hospitable, friendly service and ever-improving convenience for customers on their terms. The Company worked to aggressively deploy each of these accelerators in 2018 and will continue further implementation in 2019 and beyond. McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 16 ##TABLE_START  Experience of the Future . The Company continues to build upon its investments in EOTF, focusing on restaurant modernization and technology in order to transform the restaurant service experience and enhance the brand in the eyes of our customers. EOTF introduces a new hospitality experience via the restaurant Guest Experience Leaders and table service, both of which have proven to be critical drivers of customer satisfaction. The modernization efforts are designed to provide a better customer experience, leading to increased frequency of customer visits along with higher average check. As of the end of 2018, EOTF is now deployed in about half of the restaurants in our global system, and in 2019, the Company will continue to deploy EOTF in many markets. In 2018, the U.S. converted about 4,500 restaurants to EOTF, exceeding its ambitious target of 4,000 restaurants, resulting in over half of the U.S. restaurants now having EOTF. We expect to convert substantially all of the restaurants in the U.S. to EOTF by the end of 2020. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Digital . As the Company continues its ambitious pace of converting restaurants to EOTF, it is placing renewed emphasis on improving its existing service model (i.e., eat in, take out, or drive-thru) and strengthening its relationships with customers through technology. By evolving the technology platform, the Company is redefining how we provide convenience to customers by expanding choices for how customers order, pay and are served through additional functionality on its global mobile app, self-order kiosks, and technologies that enable conveniences such as table service and curb-side pick-up. In 2018, the Company made further progress in rolling out digital platforms to improve convenience for our customers and provide a simpler and more personalized experience. This included having kiosks deployed in nearly 17,000 restaurants, digital menu boards in more than 21,000 restaurants, and availability of Mobile Order  Pay in over 22,000 restaurants. The popularity and utilization of self-order kiosks continues to grow over time, and in France, Italy and Spain, well over half of all in-restaurant visits orders are placed through the kiosk. Germany made a strong push to grow digital engagement in 2018 through digital calendar promotions, and saw success, driving sales and guest count growth, as well as increased app downloads. In 2019, the Company will continue to utilize digital initiatives to engage customers, grow awareness and adoption of digital offerings, and support our menu offerings. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Delivery . The Company continues to build momentum with its delivery platform as a way of expanding the convenience for its customers. In 2018, McDonalds expanded the number of restaurants offering delivery and it is now available in over half of the global system. Customers are responding positively, as demonstrated by high satisfaction ratings, high reorder rates, and average checks that are 1.5-2 times higher than average non-delivery transactions. In addition, many of our larger markets, such as the U.S., France and the U.K., have achieved delivery sales growth in the high double digits in restaurants offering the service for more than 12 months. Further, in several of our top markets, delivery now represents as much as 10% of sales in those restaurants offering delivery. While growing customer awareness remains a priority and focus in 2019, we have been effective in markets like Australia, where awareness has more than doubled through a major campaign that promoted delivery with in-restaurant signs, engaging social media outreach, public relations activity and advertising. ##TABLE_END The Velocity Growth Plan is a global strategy that is tailored at a market level to allow for the best customer experience and most convenience for our valued customers. While the Plan provides a consistent framework on how to retain, regain, and convert customers, the execution varies across the globe. Markets continue to make progress on the three pillars of the Plan and its growth accelerators. The U.S., for example, remains diligently focused on driving guest count growth in 2019 through actions that collectively transform the customer experience. In addition to continuing its aggressive execution of the growth accelerators of EOTF, digital and delivery, the U.S. will also enhance the customer experience through strong restaurant execution, with a focus on the drive thru experience, and reducing complexity in the restaurants. In 2018, several markets, including key markets outside of the U.S., experienced strong business results, driven by the Velocity Growth Plan, and the markets will continue to hone their execution of the Plan in 2019, focusing on value, quality and convenience. Our Plan also includes the Company further embedding actions in response to certain social and environmental issues into the core of our business, which we refer to as using our Scale for Good. As one of the worlds largest restaurant companies, our Scale for Good highlights our commitment to global priorities that are consistent with our strategic priorities and provides an opportunity to collaborate with our franchisees and suppliers to drive meaningful progress. We recognize that our success in advancing each of the pillars within our strategy will be demonstrated as customers continue to feel good about visiting McDonalds restaurants and eating our food. While we're committed to working to address many challenges facing society today, we are elevating a few global priorities where we believe we can make the greatest difference in driving industry-wide change. Our four global priorities reflect the social and environmental impacts of our food and our business and are: beef sustainability, packaging and recycling, commitment to families and our investment in people. In 2018, the Company demonstrated its dedication to these priorities, pledging commitments related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the use of antibiotics, sourcing sustainable packaging, and making a difference for families through our food offerings, reading programs and Ronald McDonald House Charities. The Company is confident that, with the Velocity Growth Plan in place, the System will work together in 2019 to focus on improving the taste of our delicious food, enhancing convenience, offering compelling value and upholding the trust consumers place in our brand, which we believe will enhance our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth.  McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 17 2018 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The Company's 2018 financial performance continued to demonstrate that the Velocity Growth Plan is working. By focusing on the aforementioned three pillars, and the identified growth accelerators, the Company has achieved 14 consecutive quarters of positive global comparable sales. In 2018, global comparable sales increased 4.5% and global comparable guest counts increased 0.2% . ##TABLE_START  Comparable sales in the U.S. increased 2.5% and comparable guest counts decreased 2.2%. The increase in comparable sales was driven by growth in average check resulting from both product mix shifts and menu price increases. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Comparable sales in the International Lead segment increased 5.8% and comparable guest counts increased 2.4%, reflecting positive results across all markets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Comparable sales in the High Growth segment increased 4.1% and comparable guest counts increased 1.8%. This performance reflects positive results across most of the segment, led by strong performance in Italy and the Netherlands. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Comparable sales in the Foundational Markets increased 7.1% and comparable guest counts increased 1.5%, reflecting positive sales performance in Japan and across all geographic regions. ##TABLE_END In addition to improved comparable sales and consolidated guest count performance, the Company achieved the following financial results in 2018: ##TABLE_START  Due to the impact of the Company's strategic refranchising initiative, consolidated revenues decreased 8% ( 8% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Systemwide sales increased 6% (6% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consolidated operating income decreased 8% ( 8% in constant currencies). 2018 results included non-cash impairment and strategic restructuring charges. 2017 results reflected a gain on the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong, partly offset by restructuring and impairment charges. Excluding these items in both years, consolidated operating income increased 2% (2% in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating margin, defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues, increased from 41.9% in 2017 to 42.0% in 2018 . Excluding the items described in the previous bullet point, operating margin increased from 38.8% in 2017 to 43.1% in 2018. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted earnings per share of $7.54 increased 18% ( 18% in constant currencies). Refer to the Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share section on page 21 for additional details. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash provided by operations was $6.97 billion . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Capital expenditures of $2.74 billion were allocated mainly to reinvestment in existing restaurants and, to a lesser extent, to new restaurant openings. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Free cash flow was $4.23 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Across the System, about 1,100 restaurants (including those in our developmental licensee and affiliated markets) were opened. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  One-year ROIIC was ( 80.4% ) and three-year ROIIC was 78.0% for the period ended December 31, 2018 . Excluding the gain from the sale of businesses in China and Hong Kong, as well as significant investing cash inflows from strategic refranchising initiatives, one year and three year ROIIC were 10.2% and 34.7%, respectively (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company increased its quarterly cash dividend per share by 15% to $1.16 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $4.64 per share. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company returned $8.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends for the year and increased the cash return to shareholder target for the 3-year period ending 2019 to about $25 billion. ##TABLE_END OUTLOOK 2019 Outlook The following information is provided to assist in forecasting the Companys future results. ##TABLE_START  Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales, net restaurant unit expansion and the potential impacts of hyper-inflation. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1 percentage point to 2019 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the U.S. or the new International Operated Markets segment would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 6 to 7 cents. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  With about 75% of McDonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company's commodity costs. For the full year 2019, costs for the total basket of goods are expected to increase about 1% to 2% in the U.S. and about 2% in the Big Five international markets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects full year 2019 selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease about 4% in constant currencies. ##TABLE_ENDMcDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 18 ##TABLE_START  Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2019 to increase about 10% to 12% due primarily to higher average debt balances. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  A significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 80% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 35 cents. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year 2019 to be in the 24% to 26% range. Some volatility may result in a quarterly tax rate outside of the annual range. Primarily due to tax costs associated with new regulations issued in January 2019, the effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 is expected to be in the 28% to 29% range. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company expects capital expenditures for 2019 to be approximately $2.3 billion. About $1.5 billion will be dedicated to our U.S. business, nearly two-thirds of which is allocated to approximately 2,000 EOTF projects. Globally, we expect to open roughly 1,200 restaurants. We will spend approximately $600 million in our wholly owned markets to open 300 restaurants and our developmental licensee and affiliated markets will contribute capital toward the remaining 900 restaurant openings in their respective markets. The Company expects about 750 net restaurant additions in 2019. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  During 2019, the Company expects to return about $9 billion to shareholders, which will complete its cash return to shareholder target of about $25 billion for the 3-year period ending 2019. ##TABLE_END Long-Term Outlook ##TABLE_START  Over the long-term, the Company expects to achieve the following average annual (constant currency) financial targets: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating margin in the mid-40% range; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Earnings per share growth in the high-single digits; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Return on incremental invested capital in the mid-20% range. ##TABLE_END  McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 19 Consolidated Operating Results ##TABLE_START Operating results           Dollars and shares in millions, except per share data  Amount  Increase/ (decrease)   Amount  Increase/ (decrease)   Amount Revenues             Sales by Company-operated restaurants  $ 10,013  (21 %)   $ 12,719  (17 %)   $ 15,295 Revenues from franchised restaurants  11,012    10,101    9,327 Total revenues  21,025  (8 )   22,820  (7 )   24,622 Operating costs and expenses             Company-operated restaurant expenses  8,266  (21 )   10,410  (18 )   12,699 Franchised restaurants-occupancy expenses  1,973    1,789    1,718 Selling, general  administrative expenses  2,200  (1 )   2,231  (6 )   2,384 Other operating (income) expense, net  (237 )    (1,163 )  n/m   Total operating costs and expenses  12,202  (8 )   13,267  (21 )   16,877 Operating income  8,823  (8 )   9,553    7,745 Interest expense        Nonoperating (income) expense, net   (56 )    n/m   (6 ) Income before provision for income taxes  7,816  (9 )   8,573    6,866 Provision for income taxes  1,892  (44 )   3,381    2,180 Net income  $ 5,924  %   $ 5,192  %   $ 4,686 Earnings per common sharediluted  $ 7.54  %   $ 6.37  %   $ 5.44 Weighted-average common shares outstanding diluted  785.6  (4 %)   815.5  (5 %)   861.2 ##TABLE_ENDn/m Not meaningful IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonalds mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing goods and services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows. In 2018, results reflected a positive foreign currency impact of $0.04, primarily due to the stronger Euro and British Pound. In 2017, results reflected the stronger Euro, offset by the weaker British Pound. In 2016, results were negatively impacted by the weaker British Pound as well as many other currencies.

Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $0.04 on diluted earnings per share. In 2017 , net income increased 11% (11% in constant currencies) to $5.2 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 17% (17% in constant currencies) to $6.37 . Foreign currency translation had no impact on diluted earnings per share. Results in 2018 reflected a lower effective tax rate, and stronger operating performance due to an increase in sales-driven franchised margin dollars, partly offset by lower Company-operated margin dollars due to the impact of refranchising. Results in 2017 reflected stronger operating performance, GA savings, improved performance in Japan, and the benefit of a reversal of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in Japan. Included in the full year 2018 results were: ##TABLE_START  approximately $140 million, or $0.17 per share, of non-cash impairment charges; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pre-tax strategic restructuring charges of $94 million, or $0.09 per share (of which $85 million relates to the restructuring of the U.S. business); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  approximately $75 million, or $0.10 per share, of net tax cost associated with 2018 adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded in the prior year under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). ##TABLE_END Included in the full year 2017 results were: ##TABLE_START  approximately $700 million, or $0.82 per share, of net tax cost associated with the Tax Act; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a pre-tax gain of approximately $850 million on the sale of the Companys businesses in China and Hong Kong, offset in part by $150 million of restructuring and impairment charges in connection with the Companys global GA and refranchising initiatives, for a net benefit of $0.53 per share. ##TABLE_END Excluding these 2018 and 2017 items, 2018 net income was $6.2 billion, an increase of 14% (14% in constant currencies), and diluted earnings per share was $7.90, an increase of 19% (18% in constant currencies). Excluding items impacting 2017 and the 2016 strategic charges of $342 million, 2017 net income was $5.4 billion, an increase of 10% (10% in constant currencies), and diluted earnings per share was $6.66, an increase of 16% (16% in constant currencies). The Company repurchased 32.2 million shares of its stock for $5.2 billion in 2018 and 31.4 million shares of its stock for $4.6 billion in 2017 , driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share. REVENUES The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company has continually reviewed its mix of Company-owned and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be approximately 95% franchised over the long term. Franchised restaurants represent approximately 93% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide at December 31, 2018. Although refranchising allows the Company to generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams while operating with a less resource-intensive structure, the shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales are replaced by franchised revenues, where the Company receives rent and/or royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the guidance issued in Accounting Standards Codification 606, \"Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\" This standard changed the way initial fees from franchisees for new restaurant openings and new franchise terms are recognized. Under the new guidance, initial franchise fees are being recognized evenly over the franchise term rather than immediately upon receipt. Revenues for 2018 reflected a negative impact of approximately $42 million as a result of this new guidance. In 2018 , revenues decreased 8% ( 8% in constant currencies) and in 2017 , revenues decreased 7% (8% in constant currencies). For both periods, the decreases in revenues were due to the Company's strategic refranchising initiatives, partly offset by positive comparable sales.

Restructuring and impairment charges for all three years related to the Company's global refranchising and GA initiatives.

Excluding this charge, operating income for 2018 increased 2%. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  International Lead Markets: In 2018 and 2017, the constant currency operating income increase was primarily due to sales-driven improvements in franchised margin dollars across all markets. 2018 results also reflected higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses in the U.K. and Australia, while 2017 benefited from a property disposition gain in Australia. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  High Growth Markets: Results for 2018 and 2017 reflected impairment charges while 2017 also reflected a gain on the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong. Excluding these items, 2018 operating income decreased 10% (11% in constant currencies) due to the impact of refranchising in China and Hong Kong, and 2017 operating income increased 17% (15% in constant currencies) due to higher sales-driven franchised margin dollar performance, the impact of refranchising and GA savings, as well as benefiting from lower depreciation expense in China and Hong Kong. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Foundational Markets and Corporate: In 2018 and 2017, results reflected higher GA costs in Corporate, mainly due to investments in restaurant technology. 2017 results also included the benefit of the reversal of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in Japan. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating margin: Operating margin was 42.0% in 2018 , 41.9% in 2017 and 31.5% in 2016 . Excluding the previously described impairment and restructuring charges, as well as the 2017 refranchising gain, operating margin was 43.1%, 38.8% and 32.8% for the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. ##TABLE_END INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased 7% and 4% in 2018 and 2017 , respectively, primarily reflecting higher average debt balances, partly offset by lower average interest rates.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES In 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the reported effective income tax rates were 24.2% , 39.4% and 31.7%, respectively. The effective income tax rate for 2018 reflected approximately $75 million of net tax cost associated with the 2018 adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded in the prior year under the Tax Act. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act and the current year impairment charges, the effective income tax rate was 22.9% for 2018. Excluding the prior year provisional net tax cost of approximately $700 million under the Tax Act, the effective income tax rate was 31.6% for 2017. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act and the current year impairment charges, the lower effective income tax rate for 2018 reflected the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% in 2018. In addition, both 2018 and 2017 reflected a benefit from a change in tax reserves as a result of global audit progression. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $2.0 billion in 2018 and $1.5 billion in 2017 . Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Recently issued accounting standards are included in Part II, Item 8, page 37 of this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START Cash Flows  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $7.0 billion and free cash flow was $4.2 billion in 2018, an increase in free cash flow of $528 million or 14% compared with 2017. Cash provided by operations totaled $5.6 billion and free cash flow was $3.7 billion in 2017. The Company's free cash flow conversion rate was 71% in 2018 and 2017 (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12). In 2018, cash provided by operations increased by $1.4 billion or 25% compared with 2017, primarily due to lower tax payments. In 2017, cash provided by operations decreased by $508 million or 8% compared with 2016, as improved operating results were more than offset by higher income tax payments in the U.S. and other working capital changes. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.5 billion in 2018, an increase of $3 billion compared with 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower proceeds from the sale of restaurant businesses in 2018, as well as higher capital expenditures. Cash provided by investing activities totaled $562 million in 2017, an increase of $1.5 billion compared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to proceeds associated with the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong. Cash used for financing activities totaled $5.9 billion in 2018, an increase of $639 million compared with 2017, primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases. Cash used for financing activities totaled $5.3 billion in 2017, a decrease of $6 billion compared with 2016, primarily due to lower treasury stock purchases, partly offset by a decrease in net borrowings. The Companys cash and equivalents balance was $866 million and $2.5 billion at year end 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements . RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In 2018 , the Company opened 1,081 restaurants and closed 467 restaurants. In 2017 , the Company opened 929 restaurants and closed 587 restaurants. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure. Systemwide restaurants at year end ##TABLE_START    U.S. 13,914  14,036  14,155 International Lead Markets 6,987  6,921  6,851 High Growth Markets 6,305  5,884  5,552 Foundational Markets  Corporate 10,649  10,400  10,341 Total 37,855  37,241  36,899 ##TABLE_ENDMcDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 26 Approximately 93% of the restaurants at year-end 2018 were franchised, including 95% in the U.S., 88% in International Lead Markets, 83% in High Growth Markets and 98% in Foundational Markets. Capital expenditures increased $888 million or 48% in 2018, primarily due to reinvestment in existing restaurants (including investment in EOTF). Capital expenditures were relatively flat in 2017 as higher expenditures on restaurant reinvestment were offset by fewer restaurant openings that required the Company's capital. Under McDonald's developmental licensee and affiliate arrangements, licensees provide capital for the entire business and the Company generally has no capital invested. Capital expenditures invested in the U.S., International Lead Markets and High Growth Markets represented over 90% of the total in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . Capital expenditures  ##TABLE_START In millions   New restaurants $  $  $ Existing restaurants 2,111  1,236  1,108 Other (1)   Total capital expenditures $ 2,742  $ 1,854  $ 1,821 Total assets $ 32,811  $ 33,804  $ 31,024 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Primarily corporate equipment and other office-related expenditures ##TABLE_END New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with strong returns and/or opportunities for long-term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, as well as leveraging the Company's global sourcing network and best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs for new traditional McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $3.8 million in 2018 . The Company owned approximately 50% of the land and approximately 80% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2018 and 2017. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS In 2018, the Company returned approximately $8.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid. This brings the cumulative two-year return to shareholders to $16.2 billion toward our targeted return of about $25 billion for the three-year period ending 2019. Shares repurchased and dividends  ##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data   Number of shares repurchased 32.2  31.4  92.3 Shares outstanding at year end   Dividends declared per share $ 4.19  $ 3.83  $ 3.61 Treasury stock purchases (in Shareholders' equity) $ 5,247  $ 4,651  $ 11,142 Dividends paid 3,256  3,089  3,058 Total returned to shareholders $ 8,503  $ 7,740  $ 14,200 ##TABLE_ENDIn July 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $15 billion of the Company's outstanding stock, with no specified expiration date. In 2018, approximately 32.2 million shares were repurchased for $5.2 billion, bringing total purchases under the program to approximately 49.5 million shares or $7.9 billion. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 43 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2018 full year dividend of $4.19 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $1.01 per share, with an increase to $1.16 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 15% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $4.64 per share annual dividend and reflects the Companys confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors. ##TABLE_START Financial Position and Capital Resources  ##TABLE_ENDTOTAL ASSETS Total assets decreased $1.0 billion or 3% in 2018 primarily due to a decrease in cash and equivalents and the impact of foreign exchange rates, partly offset by an increase in accounts and notes receivable due to the significant number of EOTF projects and corresponding billings to franchisees for their portion of the reinvestment. Net property and equipment increased $394.4 million in 2018, primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Net property and equipment represented about 70% of total assets at year-end. Approximately 96% of total assets were in the U.S., International Lead Markets, and High Growth Markets at year-end 2018.  McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 27 FINANCING AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2018 totaled $31.1 billion, compared with $29.5 billion at December 31, 2017. The net increase in 2018 was primarily due to net long-term issuances of $2.0 billion.

These effects are excluded as they have no impact on the obligation at maturity. See Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Includes the effect of interest rate swaps used to hedge debt. ##TABLE_END Standard  Poors and Moodys currently rate, with a stable outlook, the Companys commercial paper A-2 and P-2, respectively; and its long-term debt BBB+ and Baa1, respectively. To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Under existing authorization from the Companys Board of Directors, the Company has $15.0 billion of authority to borrow funds, of which $6.5 billion remains outstanding as of December 31, 2018. These borrowings may include (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the SEC and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $3.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements). In 2019, the Company plans to issue long-term debt to refinance $2.1 billion of maturing corporate debt. As of December 31, 2018 , the Company's subsidiaries also had $254 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $11.8 billion and $12.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Companys restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2018 , the Company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to negative fair value of certain derivative positions. The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions. The Companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures ##TABLE_START In millions of U.S. Dollars  British Pounds Sterling $ 1,840  $ 1,877 Australian Dollars 1,499  1,519 Canadian Dollars  Russian Ruble  Japanese Yen  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 28 each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2018 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2018 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. LIQUIDITY The Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where we earn about 65% of our operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings have been reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $708 million as of December 31, 2018 . Consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, repatriation of a portion of foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing and financing activities. In the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Companys borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2018 . See discussions of cash flows, financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details. ##TABLE_START  Contractual cash outflows   Contractual cash inflows  In millions Operating leases (1)   Debt obligations (2)   Minimum rent under franchise arrangements   $ 1,145   $    $ 2,962  1,083   2,418   2,856  1,001   2,159   2,734    2,269   2,598    4,959   2,481 Thereafter  7,297   19,412   20,796 Total  $ 12,266   $ 31,217   $ 34,427 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) For sites that have lease escalations tied to an index, future minimum payments reflect the current index adjustments through December 31, 2018. In addition, future minimum payments exclude option periods that have not yet been exercised. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) The maturities include reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $2.4 billion , as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in December 2023. Debt obligations do not include the impact of non-cash fair value hedging adjustments, deferred debt costs and accrued interest. ##TABLE_END In the U.S., the Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") limitations. At December 31, 2018 , total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $437 million . At December 31, 2018, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $1.3 billion . In addition, a liability of approximately $757 million remains resulting from the Tax Act, which imposed a deemed repatriation tax on the Companys undistributed foreign earnings. This additional tax liability will be paid over the next eight years. Refer to the Income Taxes footnote on page 45 for additional information. There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature, will be funded from operating cash flows, and are not significant to the Companys overall financial position. ##TABLE_START Other Matters  ##TABLE_ENDCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 29 The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to confirm that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: ##TABLE_START  Property and equipment ##TABLE_END Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. ##TABLE_START  Share-based compensation ##TABLE_END The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Companys stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant, and prior to 2018 included a reduction for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. For performance-based RSUs granted beginning in 2016, the Company includes a relative Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. ##TABLE_START  Long-lived assets impairment review ##TABLE_END Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Companys experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Companys estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual market) with risk of material goodwill impairment. ##TABLE_START  Litigation accruals ##TABLE_END In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. ##TABLE_START  Income taxes ##TABLE_END The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. The most significant new developments in 2018 and 2017 are described below. In 2018 and 2017, the Company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits by $162 million and $256 million, respectively. In both 2018 and 2017, there was audit progression in the U.S. federal and state audits as well as multiple foreign tax jurisdictions. The Company has considered this new information in evaluating the unrecognized tax benefits and in certain situations, the Company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits. These changes have been reflected in the Unrecognized Tax Benefits table that is included in the Income Taxes footnote in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2015, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) that included certain disagreed transfer pricing adjustments related to the Companys U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. Also in 2015, the Company filed a protest with the IRS related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. During 2017, the Company received a response to its protest. In December 2018, the Company met with the IRS Appeals team and additional meetings are anticipated in 2019. The Company expects resolution on these issues in 2019 or 2020. In 2017, the IRS completed its examination of the Companys U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. In 2018, the IRS issued a RAR for these years. As expected, the RAR included the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 RAR. Also in 2018, the Company filed a protest with the IRS related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. The transfer pricing matters for 2011 McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 30 and 2012 are being addressed along with the 2009 and 2010 transfer pricing matters as part of the 2009-2010 appeals process, such that resolution is expected in either 2019 or 2020. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with Topic 740 - Income Taxes of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). In December 2015, the European Commission opened a formal investigation against the Luxembourg government to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries complied with European Union rules on state aid. In September 2018, the European Commission concluded that Luxembourgs tax treatment of these McDonalds subsidiaries did not constitute state aid under the European Union rules. This decision resulted in no impact to the Companys financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Tax Act was enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. In 2017, the Company recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment-date effects of the Tax Act by applying the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin (\"SAB\") 118 because the Company had not yet completed its enactment-date accounting for these effects. In 2018, the Company recorded adjustments to the provisional amounts and completed its accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 measurement period At December 31, 2017, the Company had not completed its accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Act under ASC 740, Income Taxes , primarily for the following aspects: remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, one-time transition tax, and its accounting position related to indefinite reinvestment of unremitted foreign earnings. As further discussed below, during 2018, the Company recognized adjustments of approximately $75 million to the provisional amounts recorded at December 31, 2017, primarily related to the transition tax. These adjustments are included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. One-time transition tax: The one-time transition tax is based on the Company's total post-1986 earnings and profits (\"EP\"), the tax on which it previously deferred from U.S. income taxes under U.S. law. The Company recorded a provisional amount for its one-time transition tax liability for each of its foreign subsidiaries, resulting in a transition tax liability of approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017. Upon further analyses of the Tax Act and notices and regulations issued and proposed by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Company finalized its calculations of the transition tax liability during 2018 and increased its December 31, 2017 provisional amount by approximately $75 million. The Company has elected to pay its transition tax over the eight-year period provided in the Tax Act. Deferred tax assets and liabilities: As of December 31, 2017, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future (generally 21%), by recording a provisional amount of approximately $500 million. No adjustment to the provisional amount was made in 2018. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICESINFLATION The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.

McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 36 ##TABLE_START Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  ##TABLE_ENDSummary of Significant Accounting Policies NATURE OF BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants in the global restaurant industry. All restaurants are operated either by the Company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchised arrangements, and developmental licensees and foreign affiliates under license agreements. The following table presents restaurant information by ownership type: ##TABLE_START Restaurants at December 31,   Conventional franchised 21,685  21,366  21,559 Developmental licensed 7,225  6,945  6,300 Foreign affiliated 6,175  5,797  3,371 Franchised 35,085  34,108  31,230 Company-operated 2,770  3,133  5,669 Systemwide restaurants 37,855  37,241  36,899 ##TABLE_ENDThe results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees were not material either individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale. CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily McDonalds China and Japan) are accounted for by the equity method. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the variable interest entity consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented. ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Income Taxes In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2018-02, \"Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (\"AOCI\").\" The guidance permits entities to reclassify the stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act from AOCI to retained earnings. ASU 2018-02 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. ASU 2018-02 may be applied in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change related to the Tax Act was recognized. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASU 2018-02 as of January 1, 2019, and plans to not make an election to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Act from AOCI to retained earnings. Lease Accounting In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Most prominent among the amendments is the recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. As discussed further in the Franchise Arrangements and Leasing Arrangements footnotes, the Company is engaged in a significant amount of leasing activity, both from a lessee and a lessor perspective. As required by the standard, the Company has adopted the provisions of the new standard effective January 1, 2019, using the required modified retrospective approach. The Company has elected the package of practical expedients, which allows the Company to retain the classification of existing leases; therefore, there will be minimal initial impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Moving forward, as the Company enters into new leases or as leases are modified, the expectation is that many of the Company's ground leases may be reclassified from operating classification to financing classification, which will change the timing and classification of a portion of lease expense between operating income and interest expense. It is not possible to quantify the impact at this time, due to the unknown timing of new leases and lease modifications, however the Company does not expect the impact to be material to any given year. ASU 2016-02 will have a material impact on the Consolidated Balance Sheet due to the significance of the Companys operating lease portfolio. The Company estimates adoption of the new standard will result in a Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability in the range of approximately $ 10.5 billion to $ 12.5 billion . At transition, the Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability reflect a present value of the Company's current minimum lease payments over a lease term, which may include options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using a collateralized incremental borrowing rate. The impact of ASU 2016-02 is non-cash in nature, therefore, it will not affect the Companys cash flows. The Company has also made an accounting policy election to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off the balance sheet. It will continue to recognize those lease payments in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 37 REVENUE RECOGNITION The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and foreign affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and may include initial fees. ASC 606 provides that revenues are to be recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received for those goods or services. This standard does not impact the Company's recognition of revenue from Company-operated restaurants as those sales are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. The standard also does not change the recognition of royalties from restaurants operated by franchisees or licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees, which are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Rental income from restaurants operated by conventional franchisees is also not impacted by this standard as those revenues are subject to the guidance in ASC 840, \"Leases.\" The standard does change the timing in which the Company recognizes initial fees from franchisees for new restaurant openings and new franchise terms. The Company's accounting policy through December 31, 2017, was to recognize initial franchise fees when received, upon a new restaurant opening and at the start of a new franchise term. Beginning in January 2018, initial franchise fees have been recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years. Refer to the Franchise Arrangements footnote on page 44 for additional information. The Company adopted ASC 606 as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. This method allows the standard to be applied retrospectively through a cumulative catch up adjustment recognized upon adoption. As such, comparative information in the Companys financial statements has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The cumulative adjustment recorded upon adoption of ASC 606 consisted of deferred revenue of approximately $ 600 million within long-term liabilities and approximately $ 150 million of associated adjustments to the deferred tax balances which are recorded in Deferred income taxes and Miscellaneous other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

ADVERTISING COSTS Advertising costs included in operating expenses of Company-operated restaurants primarily consist of contributions to advertising cooperatives and were (in millions): 2018  $ 388.8 ; 2017  $ 532.9 ; 2016  $ 645.8 . Production costs for radio and television advertising are expensed when the commercials are initially aired. These production costs, primarily in the U.S., as well as other marketing-related expenses included in Selling, general  administrative expenses were (in millions): 2018  $ 88.0 ; 2017  $ 100.2 ; 2016  $ 88.8 . Costs related to the Olympics sponsorship are included in the expenses for 2018 and 2016. In addition, significant advertising costs are incurred by franchisees through contributions to advertising cooperatives in individual markets. The costs incurred by these advertising cooperatives are approved and managed jointly by vote of both Company-operated restaurants and franchisees. McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 38 SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Share-based compensation includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value. Share-based compensation expense and the effect on diluted earnings per common share were as follows: ##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data   Share-based compensation expense $ 125.1  $ 117.5  $ 131.3 After tax $ 108.1  $ 82.0  $ 89.6 Earnings per common share-diluted $ 0.14  $ 0.10  $ 0.11 ##TABLE_ENDCompensation expense related to share-based awards is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in Selling, general  administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2018, there was $ 114.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for the 2018 , 2017 and 2016 stock option grants. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical trends. Expected stock price volatility is generally based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock for a period approximating the expected life. The expected dividend yield is based on the Companys most recent annual dividend rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life. Weighted-average assumptions ##TABLE_START  2017 Expected dividend yield 2.6 % 3.1 % 3.0 % Expected stock price volatility 18.7 % 18.4 % 19.2 % Risk-free interest rate 2.7 % 2.2 % 1.2 % Expected life of options (in years) 5.8 5.9 5.9 Fair value per option granted $ 23.80 $ 16.10 $ 13.65 ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant, and prior to 2018 included a reduction for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. For performance-based RSUs granted beginning in 2016, the Company includes a relative TSR modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildingsup to 40 years; leasehold improvements the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms , which generally include certain option periods; and equipment 3 to 12 years. LONG-LIVED ASSETS Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing McDonalds restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together in the U.S. at a field office level, and internationally, at a market level. The Company manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurants cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows. Losses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal and the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses are related to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered available for sale.\" GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurant businesses. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of McDonald's restaurants from franchisees and ownership increases in subsidiaries or affiliates, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit (defined as each individual market) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit.  McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 39 The following table presents the 2018 activity in goodwill by segment: ##TABLE_START In millions U.S. International Lead Markets  High Growth Markets  Foundational Markets  Corporate  Consolidated  Balance at December 31, 2017 $ 1,274.0  $ 750.5  $ 316.7  $ 38.5  $ 2,379.7 Net restaurant purchases (sales) 2.5  20.2  ( 1.3 )  ( 0.3 )  21.1 Impairment losses       ( 1.1 )  ( 1.1 ) Currency translation   ( 52.4 )  ( 14.1 )  ( 1.7 )  ( 68.2 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 1,276.5  $ 718.3  $ 301.3  $ 35.4  $ 2,331.5 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company conducts goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever an indicator of impairment exists. If an indicator of impairment exists (e.g., estimated earnings multiple value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value), the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit, generally based on discounted future cash flows, with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the carrying amount of goodwill. Historically, goodwill impairment has not significantly impacted the consolidated financial statements. Accumulated goodwill impairment losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $ 15.6 million and $ 14.5 million , respectively. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, and certain non-financial assets and liabilities on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value disclosures are reflected in a three-level hierarchy, maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: ##TABLE_START  Level 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for an identical asset or liability in an active market. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for a similar asset or liability in an active market or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END Certain of the Companys derivatives are valued using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate observable market parameters, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates, classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. Derivative valuations incorporate credit risk adjustments that are necessary to reflect the probability of default by the counterparty or the Company.  ##TABLE_START  Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value ##TABLE_END The following tables present financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the valuation hierarchy as defined in the fair value guidance: ##TABLE_START December 31, 2018       In millions Level 1*  Level 2  Carrying Value  Derivative assets $ 167.1  $ 39.2   $ 206.3 Derivative liabilities   $ ( 16.6 )   $ ( 16.6 )         December 31, 2017       In millions Level 1*  Level 2  Carrying Value  Derivative assets $ 167.3  $ 0.6   $ 167.9 Derivative liabilities   $ ( 45.4 )   $ ( 45.4 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Level 1 is comprised of derivatives that hedge market driven changes in liabilities associated with the Companys supplemental benefit plans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis ##TABLE_END Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded fair value adjustments to its long-lived assets, primarily to property and equipment, based on Level 3 inputs which includes the use of a discounted cash flow valuation approach. ##TABLE_START  Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2018, the fair value of the Companys debt obligations was estimated at $ 31.7 billion , compared to a carrying amount of $ 31.1 billion . The fair value was based on quoted market prices, Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. The carrying amount for both cash equivalents and notes receivable approximate fair value. McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 40 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES In 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2017-12, \"Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)\", utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt and derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of these changes. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. The Company documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions, as well as all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items. The Companys derivatives that are designated for hedge accounting consist mainly of interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, and cross-currency swaps, and are classified as either fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. Further details are explained in the \"Fair Value,\" \"Cash Flow\" and \"Net Investment\" hedge sections. The Company also enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Further details are explained in the Undesignated Derivatives section. All derivatives (including those not designated for hedge accounting) are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity dates. Changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments are reflected as adjustments to AOCI and/or current earnings. The following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 : ##TABLE_START  Derivative Assets  Derivative Liabilities In millions Balance Sheet Classification    Balance Sheet Classification   Derivatives designated as hedging instruments         Foreign currency Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $ 30.9  $ 0.5  Accrued payroll and other liabilities  $ ( 0.7 )  $ ( 31.0 ) Interest rate Prepaid expenses and other current assets      Accrued payroll and other liabilities  ( 0.1 )  ( 0.3 ) Foreign currency Miscellaneous other assets  3.8  0.1  Other long-term liabilities  ( 1.3 )  ( 1.4 ) Interest rate Miscellaneous other assets      Other long-term liabilities  ( 11.8 )  ( 5.9 ) Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments  $ 34.7  $ 0.6    $ ( 13.9 )  $ ( 38.6 ) Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments         Equity Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $ 167.1  $   Accrued payroll and other liabilities  $ ( 2.7 )  $ ( 1.3 ) Foreign currency Prepaid expenses and other current assets  4.5    Accrued payroll and other liabilities    ( 5.5 ) Equity Miscellaneous other assets    167.3       Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments  $ 171.6  $ 167.3    ( 2.7 )  $ ( 6.8 ) Total derivatives  $ 206.3  $ 167.9    $ ( 16.6 )  $ ( 45.4 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe following table presents the pre-tax amounts from derivative instruments affecting income and AOCI for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively: ##TABLE_START  Location of Gain or Loss Recognized in Income on Derivative  Gain (Loss) Recognized in Accumulated OCI  Gain (Loss) Reclassified into Income from Accumulated OCI  Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivative         In millions        Foreign currency Nonoperating income/expense  $ 60.0  $ ( 76.0 )  $ ( 2.2 )  $ ( 13.7 )     Interest rate Interest expense      ( 1.2 )  ( 0.5 )     Cash flow hedges  $ 60.0  $ ( 76.0 )  $ ( 3.4 )  $ ( 14.2 )                   Foreign currency denominated debt Nonoperating income/expense  $ 682.9  $ ( 1,599.7 )  $   $      Foreign currency derivatives Nonoperating income/expense  1.3  ( 8.9 )    8.6     Foreign currency derivatives (1) Interest expense          $ 4.0  $  Net investment hedges  $ 684.2  $ ( 1,608.6 )  $   $ 8.6  $ 4.0  $                Foreign currency Nonoperating income/expense          $ 22.1  $ ( 24.2 ) Equity Selling, general  administrative expenses          0.4  92.7 Undesignated derivatives          $ 22.5  $ 68.5 (1) The amount of gain (loss) recognized in income related to components excluded from effectiveness testing. ##TABLE_END McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 41 Fair Value Hedges The Company enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure to changes in fair values of certain liabilities. The Company enters into fair value hedges that convert a portion of its fixed rate debt into floating rate debt by use of interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2018 , the carrying amount of fixed-rate debt that was effectively converted was $ 738.0 million , which included a decrease of $ 12.0 million of cumulative hedging adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2018 , the Company recognized a $ 5.8 million loss on the fair value of interest rate swaps, and a corresponding gain on the fair value of the related hedged debt instrument to Interest expense. Cash Flow Hedges The Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies), the Company uses foreign currency forwards to hedge a portion of anticipated exposures. The hedges cover the next 18 months for certain exposures and are denominated in various currencies. As of December 31, 2018 , the Company had derivatives outstanding with an equivalent notional amount of $ 726.3 million that hedged a portion of forecasted foreign currency denominated cash flows. Based on market conditions at December 31, 2018 , the $ 32.4 million in cumulative cash flow hedging gains, after tax, is not expected to have a significant effect on earnings over the next 12 months. Net Investment Hedges The Company primarily uses foreign currency denominated debt (third party and intercompany) to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders' equity in the foreign currency translation component of OCI and offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in OCI. As of December 31, 2018 , $ 10.8 billion of the Company's third party foreign currency denominated debt and $ 3.5 billion of intercompany foreign currency denominated debt were designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Undesignated Derivatives The Company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting, therefore the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings together with the gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. As an example, the Company enters into equity derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Selling, general  administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in Nonoperating (income) expense, net, along with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. The Company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2018 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. For financial reporting purposes, the Company presents gross derivative balances in the financial statements and supplementary data, including for counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2018 , the Company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to the negative fair value of certain derivative positions. The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on certain hedges of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions. INCOME TAXES Income Tax Uncertainties The Company, like other multi-national companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. Accordingly, tax liabilities are recorded when, in managements judgment, a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may still be recorded depending on managements assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled. The Company records interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\"GILTI\") The Tax Act requires a U.S. shareholder of a foreign corporation to include GILTI in taxable income. The accounting policy of the Company is to record any tax on GILTI in the provision for income taxes in the year it is incurred.  McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 42 PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION Diluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of shares): 2018  7.3 ; 2017  8.1 ; 2016  6.8 . Stock options that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutive were (in millions of shares): 2018  0.5 ; 2017  0.1 ; 2016  1.2 . CASH AND EQUIVALENTS The Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.

Charges associated with strategic initiatives, such as refranchising and restructuring activities are also included. In addition, as the Company continues to make progress toward its long-term global refranchising goals, the realized gains/losses from the sale of McDonald's businesses in certain markets are reflected in this category, including the 2017 gain on the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong.  McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 43 ##TABLE_START Contingencies  ##TABLE_ENDIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. ##TABLE_START Franchise Arrangements  ##TABLE_ENDConventional franchise arrangements generally include a lease and a license and provide for payment of initial fees, as well as continuing rent and royalties to the Company based upon a percent of sales with minimum rent payments. Minimum rent payments are based on the Company's underlying investment in owned sites and parallel the Companys underlying leases and escalations on properties that are leased. Under the franchise arrangement, franchisees are granted the right to operate a restaurant using the McDonalds System and, in most cases, the use of a restaurant facility, generally for a period of 20 years . These franchisees pay related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance. Developmental licensees and affiliates operating under license agreements pay a royalty to the Company based upon a percent of sales, and may pay initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants consisted of: ##TABLE_START In millions   Rents $ 7,082.2  $ 6,496.3  $ 6,107.6 Royalties 3,886.3  3,518.7  3,129.9 Initial fees 44.0  86.5  89.4 Revenues from franchised restaurants $ 11,012.5  $ 10,101.5  $ 9,326.9 ##TABLE_ENDFuture gross minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing conventional franchise arrangements are: ##TABLE_START In millions Owned sites   Leased sites  Total  $ 1,452.3  $ 1,509.4  $ 2,961.7  1,417.1  1,438.5  2,855.6  1,374.0  1,360.3  2,734.3  1,322.8  1,275.0  2,597.8  1,275.5  1,205.9  2,481.4 Thereafter  11,116.4  9,680.1  20,796.5 Total minimum payments  $ 17,958.1  $ 16,469.2  $ 34,427.3 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2018 , net property and equipment under franchise arrangements totaled $ 17.8 billion (including land of $ 4.9 billion ) after deducting accumulated depreciation and amortization of $ 10.4 billion .  McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 44 ##TABLE_START Leasing Arrangements  ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2018, the Company was the lessee at 12,334 restaurant locations through ground leases (the Company leases the land and the Company generally owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases land and buildings). Lease terms for most restaurants, where market conditions allow, are generally for 20 years and, in many cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options, with certain leases providing purchase options. Escalation terms vary by market with examples including fixed-rent escalations, escalations based on an inflation index and fair-value market adjustments. The timing of these escalations generally range from annually to every five years . For most franchised locations, the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance; are required to be paid by the franchisees as part of the franchise arrangement.

The goal of this update was to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective method, resulting in a cumulative catch up adjustment of $57 million, the majority of which was recorded within Miscellaneous other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income and cash flows. The Tax Act was enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. In 2017, the Company recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment-date effects of the Tax Act by applying the guidance in SAB 118 because the Company had not yet completed its enactment-date accounting for these effects. In 2018, the Company recorded adjustments to the provisional amounts and completed its accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Act.  McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 45 SAB 118 measurement period At December 31, 2017, the Company had not completed its accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Act under ASC 740, Income Taxes , primarily for the following aspects: remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, one-time transition tax, and its accounting position related to indefinite reinvestment of unremitted foreign earnings. As further discussed below, during 2018, the Company recognized adjustments of approximately $ 75 million to the provisional amounts recorded at December 31, 2017, primarily related to the transition tax. These adjustments are included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. One-time transition tax: The one-time transition tax is based on the Company's total post-1986 earnings and profits (\"EP\"), the tax on which it previously deferred from U.S. income taxes under U,S. law. The Company recorded a provisional amount for its one-time transition tax liability of approximately $ 1.2 billion at December 31, 2017. Upon further analyses of the Tax Act and notices and regulations issued and proposed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS, the Company increased its December 31, 2017 provisional amount by approximately $ 75 million during 2018. The Company has elected to pay its transition tax over the eight-year period provided in the Tax Act. Deferred tax assets and liabilities: As of December 31, 2017, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future (generally 21%), by recording a provisional amount of approximately $ 500 million . No adjustment to the provisional amount was made in 2018. The provision for income taxes, classified by the timing and location of payment, was as follows: ##TABLE_START In millions   U.S. federal $ 292.9  $ 2,030.8  $ 1,046.6 U.S. state 183.9  169.8  121.3 Outside the U.S. 1,312.4  1,217.0  1,550.2 Current tax provision 1,789.2  3,417.6  2,718.1 U.S. federal 145.7  ( 120.1 )  ( 122.1 ) U.S. state 18.7  12.8  14.1 Outside the U.S. ( 61.8 )  70.9  ( 430.6 ) Deferred tax provision 102.6  ( 36.4 )  ( 538.6 ) Provision for income taxes $ 1,891.8  $ 3,381.2  $ 2,179.5 ##TABLE_ENDNet deferred tax liabilities consisted of: ##TABLE_START In millions December 31, 2018   Property and equipment   $ 1,288.9  $ 1,211.5 Intangible liabilities   312.3  296.2 Other   347.9  242.0 Total deferred tax liabilities   1,949.1  1,749.7 Property and equipment   ( 658.9 )  ( 633.8 ) Employee benefit plans   ( 213.3 )  ( 253.1 ) Intangible assets   ( 1,081.5 )  ( 228.8 ) Deferred foreign tax credits   ( 216.6 )  ( 208.6 ) Deferred revenue   ( 138.9 )   Operating loss carryforwards   ( 45.7 )  ( 71.1 ) Other   ( 269.2 )  ( 266.0 ) Total deferred tax assets before valuation allowance   ( 2,624.1 )  ( 1,661.4 ) Valuation allowance   671.1  163.2 Net deferred tax (assets) liabilities   $ ( 3.9 )  $ 251.5 Balance sheet presentation:      Deferred income taxes   $ 1,215.5  $ 1,119.4 Other assets-miscellaneous   ( 1,219.4 )  ( 867.9 ) Net deferred tax (assets) liabilities   $ ( 3.9 )  $ 251.5 ##TABLE_ENDAt December 31, 2018, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $ 216.7 million , of which $ 136.6 million has an indefinite carryforward. The remainder will expire at various dates from 2019 to 2037. Prior to 2018, the Company's effective income tax rate was generally lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because foreign income was generally subject to local statutory country tax rates that were below the 35% U.S. statutory tax rate and reflected the impact of global transfer pricing. Beginning in 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate to 21 % . As a result, the Companys 2018 effective income tax rate is higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to the impact of state income taxes and foreign income that is subject to local statutory country tax rates that are above the 21% U.S. statutory tax rate. McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 46 The statutory U.S. federal income tax rate reconciles to the effective income tax rates as follows: ##TABLE_START    Statutory U.S. federal income tax rate 21.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % State income taxes, net of related federal income tax benefit 1.8  1.2  1.5 Foreign income taxed at different rates 1.5  ( 4.6 )  ( 6.5 ) Transition tax 1.0  13.7   US net deferred tax liability remeasurement   ( 6.0 )   Other, net ( 1.1 )  0.1  1.7 Effective income tax rates 24.2 %  39.4 %  31.7 % ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the Companys gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $ 1,342.8 million and $ 1,180.4 million , respectively. After considering the deferred tax accounting impact, it is expected that about $ 940 million of the total as of December 31, 2018 would favorably affect the effective tax rate if resolved in the Companys favor. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START In millions  Balance at January 1 $ 1,180.4  $ 924.1 Decreases for positions taken in prior years ( 64.1 )  ( 13.7 ) Increases for positions taken in prior years 180.8  143.9 Increases for positions related to the current year 75.1  140.2 Settlements with taxing authorities ( 24.1 )  ( 6.5 ) Lapsing of statutes of limitations ( 5.3 )  ( 7.6 ) Balance at December 31 (1) $ 1,342.8  $ 1,180.4 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Of this amount, $ 1,313.7 million and $ 1,132.3 million are included in Other long-term liabilities for 2018 and 2017 , respectively, and $ 12.5 million and $ 30.8 million are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets for 2018 and 2017, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remainder is included in Deferred income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. ##TABLE_END In 2015, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) that included certain disagreed transfer pricing adjustments related to the Companys U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. Also in 2015, the Company filed a protest with the IRS related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. During 2017, the Company received a response to its protest. In December 2018, the Company met with the IRS Appeals team and additional meetings are anticipated in 2019. In 2017, the IRS completed its examination of the Companys U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. In 2018, the IRS issued a RAR for these years. As expected, the RAR included the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 RAR. Also in 2018, the Company filed a protest with the IRS related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. The transfer pricing matters for 2011 and 2012 are being addressed along with the 2009 and 2010 transfer pricing matters as part of the 2009-2010 appeals process. The Company is also under audit in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions for matters primarily related to transfer pricing, and the Company is under audit in multiple state tax jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease up to $ 900 million within the next 12 months, of which only a portion could favorably affect the effective tax rate. This would be due to the possible settlement of the IRS transfer pricing matters, completion of the aforementioned foreign and state tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions. In addition, it is reasonably possible that, as a result of audit progression in both the U.S. and foreign tax audits within the next 12 months, there may be new information that causes the Company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded. While the Company cannot estimate the impact that new information may have on our unrecognized tax benefit balance, it believes that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate. The Company operates within multiple tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2009. The Company had $ 152.0 million and $ 155.3 million accrued for interest and penalties at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalties related to tax matters of $ 13.9 million in 2018 , $ 34.9 million in 2017, and $ 41.7 million in 2016 , which are included in the provision for income taxes. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed the accounting of the income tax effects of the Tax Act, including the conclusion on the Companys accounting position related to the indefinite reinvestment of unremitted foreign earnings. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries, which were predominantly taxed in the U.S. as a result of the transition tax provisions enacted under the Tax Act. Management does not assert that these previously-taxed unremitted earnings are indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. Accordingly, the Company has provided deferred taxes for the tax effects incremental to the transition tax. We have not provided for deferred taxes on outside basis differences in our investments in our foreign subsidiaries that are unrelated to these accumulated undistributed earnings, as these outside basis differences are indefinitely reinvested. A determination of the unrecognized deferred taxes related to these other components of our outside basis differences is not practicable.   McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 47 ##TABLE_START Employee Benefit Plans  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company's 401k Plan is maintained for U.S.-based employees and includes a 401(k) feature, as well as an employer match. The 401(k) feature allows participants to make pre-tax contributions that are matched each pay period (with an annual true-up) from cash contributions and through July 31, 2018 from shares released under the Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Effective August 1, 2018, the contributions are matched only through cash contributions. All current account balances, future contributions and related earnings can be invested in eight investment alternatives as well as McDonalds stock in accordance with each participants investment elections. Future participant contributions are limited to 20 % investment in McDonalds stock. Participants may choose to make separate investment choices for current account balances and future contributions. The Company also maintains certain nonqualified supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the 401k Plan because of IRS limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the 401k Plan. Total liabilities were $ 437.4 million at December 31, 2018 , and $ 484.3 million at December 31, 2017 , and were primarily included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of the liabilities. At December 31, 2018 , derivatives with a fair value of $ 167.1 million indexed to the Company's stock and a total return swap with a notional amount of $ 169.2 million indexed to certain market indices were included at their fair value in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Accrued payroll and other liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in liabilities for these nonqualified plans and in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded primarily in Selling, general  administrative expenses. Changes in fair value of the derivatives indexed to the Companys stock are recorded in the income statement because the contracts provide the counterparty with a choice to settle in cash or shares. Total U.S. costs for the 401k Plan, including nonqualified benefits and related hedging activities, were (in millions): 2018  $ 18.0 ; 2017  $ 19.3 ; 2016  $ 24.8 . Certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. also offer profit sharing, stock purchase or other similar benefit plans. Total plan costs outside the U.S. were (in millions): 2018  $ 33.7 ; 2017  $ 43.3 ; 2016  $ 46.0 . The total combined liabilities for international retirement plans were $ 40.6 million and $ 44.6 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Other post-retirement benefits and post-employment benefits were immaterial.

Fees and interest rates on this line are primarily based on the Companys long-term credit rating assigned by Moodys and Standard  Poors . In addition, the Company's subsidiaries had unused lines of credit that were primarily uncommitted, short-term and denominated in various currencies at local market rates of interest . The weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings was 2.6 % at December 31, 2018 (based on $ 253.5 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings and $ 99.9 million of commercial paper outstanding) and 2.5 % at December 31, 2017 (based on $ 268.0 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings). DEBT OBLIGATIONS The Company has incurred debt obligations principally through public and private offerings and bank loans. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions, and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. Under certain agreements, the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at par or at a premium over par. The Company has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt prior to maturity. The following table summarizes the Companys debt obligations (interest rates and debt amounts reflected in the table include the effects of interest rate swaps used to hedge debt). ##TABLE_START    Interest rates (1) December 31    Amounts outstanding December 31  In millions of U.S. Dollars Maturity dates      Fixed   4.0 %  4.0 %   $ 18,075.8  $ 15,533.3 Floating   3.4  4.3   1,349.9  1,750.0 Total U.S. Dollars 2019-2048       19,425.7  17,283.3 Fixed   1.6  1.6   8,069.1  8,446.6 Floating   0.0  0.0   1,264.1  1,323.4 Total Euro 2019-2029       9,333.2  9,770.0 Total British Pounds Sterling - Fixed 2020-2054  5.3  5.3   952.3  1,008.9 Total Canadian Dollar - Fixed 2021-2025  3.1  3.1   732.0  793.8 Total Japanese Yen - Fixed  2.9  2.9   114.0  110.9 Fixed   0.3  0.8   414.9  451.5 Floating   2.6  2.3   244.2  244.7 Total other currencies (2) 2019-2056       659.1  696.2 Debt obligations before fair value adjustments and deferred debt costs (3)        31,216.3  29,663.1 Fair value adjustments (4)        ( 12.0 )  ( 6.2 ) Deferred debt costs        ( 129.0 )  ( 120.5 ) Total debt obligations        $ 31,075.3  $ 29,536.4 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Weighted-average effective rate, computed on a semi-annual basis. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Primarily consists of Swiss Francs and Korean Won. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Aggregate maturities for 2018 debt balances, before fair value adjustments and deferred debt costs, are as follows (in millions): 2019  $ 0.0 ; 2020  $ 2,418.0 ; 2021  $ 2,159.0 ; 2022  $ 2,269.1 ; 2023  $ 4,958.5 ; Thereafter $ 19,411.7 .

The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plans was 46.5 million at December 31, 2018 , including 28.4 million available for future grants. STOCK OPTIONS Stock options to purchase common stock are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Companys stock on the date of grant. Substantially all of the options become exercisable in four equal installments, beginning a year from the date of the grant, and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. Intrinsic value for stock options is defined as the difference between the current market value of the Companys stock and the exercise price. During 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $ 364.4 million , $ 353.6 million and $ 184.9 million , respectively. Cash received from stock options exercised during 2018 was $ 403.2 million and the tax benefit realized from stock options exercised totaled $ 73.2 million . The Company uses treasury shares purchased under the Companys share repurchase program to satisfy share-based exercises. A summary of the status of the Companys stock option grants as of December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , and changes during the years then ended, is presented in the following table: ##TABLE_START       Options Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price   Weighted- average remaining contractual life in years  Aggregate intrinsic value in millions   Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price   Shares in millions  Weighted- average exercise price  Outstanding at beginning of year 18.9   $ 101.55       21.5   $ 92.25  21.9   $ 84.76 Granted 2.7   157.95       4.0   128.74  4.3   117.10 Exercised ( 4.5 )   89.31       ( 5.6 )   81.77  ( 4.0 )   75.30 Forfeited/expired ( 0.5 )   137.08       ( 1.0 )   118.38  ( 0.7 )   106.50 Outstanding at end of year 16.6   $ 113.06  6.2   $ 1,073.4  18.9   $ 101.55  21.5   $ 92.25 Exercisable at end of year 10.0   $ 98.65  4.9   $ 792.0  11.3     13.4    ##TABLE_ENDRSUs RSUs generally vest 100 % on the third anniversary of the grant and are payable in either shares of McDonalds common stock or cash, at the Companys discretion.

Separately, Company executives have been awarded RSUs that vest based on Company performance. For performance-based RSUs granted beginning in 2016, the Company includes a relative TSR modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.

McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 52 ##TABLE_START Managements Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  ##TABLE_END The financial statements were prepared by management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity and for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: ##TABLE_START I. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START II. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START III. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ##TABLE_END There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may vary over time. Management assessed the design and effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on managements assessment using those criteria, as of December 31, 2018 , management believes that the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
