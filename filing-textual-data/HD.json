Business. ##TABLE_END Introduction The Home Depot, Inc. is the worlds largest home improvement retailer based on Net Sales for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2010 (fiscal 2009). The Home Depot stores sell a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement and lawn and garden products and provide a number of services. The Home Depot stores average approximately 105,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. As of the end of fiscal 2009, we had 2,244 The Home Depot stores located throughout the United States including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam (U.S.), Canada, China and Mexico. The Home Depot, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1978. Our Store Support Center (corporate office) is located at 2455 Paces Ferry Road, N.W., Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Our telephone number is (770) 433-8211. We maintain an Internet website at www.homedepot.com. We make available on our website, free of charge, our Annual Reports to shareholders, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5 as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such documents with, or furnishing such documents to, the SEC. We include our website addresses throughout this filing only as textual references. The information contained on our websites is not incorporated by reference into this report.  Our Business Operating Strategy. In fiscal 2009, despite prolonged difficulties in the economy, we continued to focus on our core retail business, investing in our associates and stores and improving our customer service. This focus reflected a continuation of strategies implemented in the fiscal year ended February 1, 2009 (fiscal 2008), including the decision, announced in late January 2009, to close our EXPO Design Center, THD Design Center, Yardbirds and HD Bath businesses (the Exited Businesses). In fiscal 2009, we maintained our focus on maximizing the productivity of our existing store base. During the year, we continued to implement significant changes in our store operations to make them simpler, more consistent and more customer-focused. We shifted associate hours to be more customer facing, provided additional customer service and product knowledge training to our associates and refocused our efforts on offering every day values in the stores. Additionally, we continued to make strategic decisions intended to optimize our capital allocation, control expenses and create long-term value for our shareholders. Customers. The Home Depot stores serve three primary customer groups: ##TABLE_START    Do-It-Yourself (D-I-Y) Customers: These customers are typically home owners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Do-It-For-Me (D-I-F-M) Customers: These customers are typically home owners who purchase materials themselves and hire third parties to complete the project or installation. We arrange for the installation of a variety of The Home Depot products through qualified independent contractors. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Professional Customers: These customers are professional remodelers, general contractors, repairmen, small business owners and tradesmen. In many stores, we offer a variety of programs to these customers, including delivery and will-call services, dedicated staff and expanded credit programs, all of which we believe increase sales to these customers. ##TABLE_END Products. A typical Home Depot store stocks approximately 30,000 to 40,000 products during the year, including both national brand name and proprietary items. The following table shows the percentage of Net Sales of each major product group (and related services) for each of the last three fiscal years: ##TABLE_START   Percentage of Net Sales for Fiscal Year Ended  Product Group  January 31, 2010   February 1, 2009   February 3, 2008  Plumbing, electrical and kitchen  29.8 %  30.6 %  31.0 % Hardware and seasonal  29.1   28.7   28.0  Building materials, lumber and millwork  21.9   22.1   22.3  Paint and flooring  19.2   18.6   18.7           Total  100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 %          ##TABLE_END In fiscal 2009, we reduced our inventory while improving our in-stock rate. We also reduced a number of one-time discount promotions and refocused our efforts on offering every day values. We continued to introduce innovative and distinctive products to our customers, including Thomasville  deep seating patio furniture, Behr Premium Plus Ultra  paint and primer in one, Charbroil  infrared grills, RIDGID  pressure washers and Homelite  trimmers. To complement and enhance our product selection, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. During fiscal 2009, we offered a number of proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments including, but not limited to, Behr Premium Plus  paint, Hampton Bay  lighting, Vigoro  lawn care products, Husky  hand tools, RIDGID  and Ryobi  power tools and Glacier Bay  bath fixtures. We also announced our  partnership with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia to offer an exclusive Martha Stewart Living brand of home improvement products in select categories including outdoor living and paint. We may consider additional strategic alliances and relationships with other suppliers and will continue to assess opportunities to expand the range of products available under brand names that are exclusive to The Home Depot. From our Store Support Center we maintain a global sourcing merchandise program to source high-quality products directly from manufacturers around the world. Our merchant team identifies and purchases market leading innovative products directly for our stores. Additionally, we have three sourcing offices located in the Chinese cities of Shanghai, Shenzhen and Dalian, and offices in Gurgaon, India; Rome, Italy; Monterrey, Mexico and Toronto, Canada. Services. Our stores offer a variety of installation services. These services target D-I-F-M customers who select and purchase products and installation of those products from us. These installation programs include products such as carpeting, flooring, cabinets, countertops and water heaters. In addition, we provide professional installation of a number of products sold through our in-home sales programs, such as generators and furnace and central air systems. Store Growth. United States . At the end of fiscal 2009, we were operating 1,976 The Home Depot stores in the U.S., including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. During fiscal 2009, we opened five new The Home Depot stores in the U.S. Canada . At the end of fiscal 2009, we were operating 179 The Home Depot stores in ten Canadian provinces. Of these stores, three were opened during fiscal 2009. Mexico . At the end of fiscal 2009, we were operating 79 The Home Depot stores in Mexico. Of these stores, five were opened during fiscal 2009. China . At the end of fiscal 2009, we were operating 10 The Home Depot stores in four Chinese cities. Net Sales for the Company outside of the U.S. were $7.0 billion for fiscal 2009 and were $7.4 billion for fiscal 2008 and 2007. Long-lived assets outside of the U.S. totaled $3.0 billion, $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion as of January 31, 2010, February 1, 2009 and February 3, 2008, respectively. Store Support Services Information Technologies. During fiscal 2009, we continued to make information technology investments to better support our customers and provide an improved overall shopping environment and experience. We invested in our supply chain and merchandising tools to improve inventory management capabilities and streamline our operations. With regard to our supply chain, in fiscal 2009 we continued implementation of our new warehouse management system and new transportation management system. We also made additional enhancements to our Central Automated Replenishment system. We provided additional tools and made improvements to existing tools utilized in merchandising systems in the areas of assortment management, forecasting and replenishment. With our continued focus on the stores, we provided additional technology improvements designed to help store associates perform their tasks and improve customer service. In fiscal 2009, we equipped 1,977 stores with new servers, 211 stores with new computers, registers and printers and 63 stores with new paint dispensers. Credit Services. We offer private label credit products in our stores through a third-party credit provider to professional, D-I-Y and D-I-F-M customers. In fiscal 2009, approximately 2.8 million new The Home Depot  private label credit accounts were opened, and the total number of The Home Depot active account holders was approximately 12 million. Private label credit card sales accounted for approximately 25% of store sales in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2008, Home Depot renegotiated and extended the term of the primary contracts governing the private label program. In fiscal 2009, we continued to benefit from our new contracts which established a ceiling for the cost of credit for the program while retaining the ability for portfolio performance improvements to lower the cost of credit. Logistics. We continued our supply chain transformation in fiscal 2009 to ensure product availability for customers, effective use of our investment in inventory and low total supply chain costs. Across our supply chain operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, we restructured our distribution center network to meet the changing needs of our business, including the Rapid Deployment Center (RDC) build-out in the U.S. and general distribution center space rationalization initiatives. RDCs allow for aggregation of store product needs to a single purchase order, and then rapid allocation and deployment of inventory to individual stores upon arrival at the center. This process allows improved transportation, simplified order processing at suppliers and reduced lead time from the time that product needs at stores are determined to actual replenishment. As a result of the changes to our distribution network, in fiscal 2009 we added 5.2 million square feet of distribution center space, primarily for new RDCs, and closed other distribution center operations occupying approximately 2.4 million square feet, primarily as a result of eliminating conventional distribution center space in the U.S. At the end of fiscal 2009, we operated 30 lumber distribution centers, 36 conventional distribution centers and two transit facilities, all located in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Additionally in fiscal 2009, we opened seven new RDCs in the U.S., bringing our total number of RDCs to 12. We now serve approximately 1,250 of our U.S. stores from RDCs, which represents approximately 65% of our U.S. stores, and have onboarded approximately 35% of our costs of sales for those stores. We plan to open additional RDCs during fiscal 2010 and ultimately serve all of our U.S. stores from RDCs. We remain committed to our overall RDC roll-out strategy, supporting our goal of increasing our central distribution penetration. Associates. At the end of fiscal 2009, we employed approximately 317,000 associates, of whom approximately 19,000 were salaried, with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis. Approximately 61% of our associates are employed on a full-time basis. We believe that our employee relations are very good. To attract and retain qualified personnel, we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve. Intellectual Property. Our business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, e-commerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business. We also maintain patent portfolios relating to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our products or business operations. Quality Assurance Program. We have both quality assurance and engineering resources that are dedicated to overseeing the quality of our directly imported, globally-sourced and proprietary products at the factory, product and packaging levels. Through these programs, we have established criteria for supplier and product performance that are designed to ensure that our products comply with federal, state and local safety, quality and performance standards and to allow us to measure and track the timeliness of shipments. We also have a Supplier Social and Environmental Responsibility Program designed to ensure that our suppliers adhere to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility. Environmental, Health  Safety (EHS). We are committed to maintaining a safe environment for our customers and associates and protecting the environment of the communities in which we do business. Our EHS function in the field is directed by trained associates focused primarily on the execution of the EHS programs. Additionally, we have a Store Support Center-based team of dedicated EHS professionals who evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a Company-wide basis.  Environmental. The Home Depot is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner. This commitment impacts all areas of our business, including store construction and maintenance, energy usage, supply chain, product selection and delivery of product knowledge to our customers. In fiscal 2009, we spent approximately $22 million for energy efficiency-related projects and saved over 114 million kilowatt hours (kWh) compared to fiscal 2008, enough to power over 10,000 U.S. homes for one year. We continued to implement strict operational standards that establish energy efficient practices in all of our facilities. These include HVAC unit temperature regulation and adherence to strict lighting schedules, which are the largest sources of energy consumption in our stores, as well as utilizing the Novar Energy Management and Alarm System in each store to monitor energy efficiency. We estimate that by implementing and utilizing these energy saving programs, we have saved over 2.6 billion kWh since 2004, enough to power approximately 203,000 U.S. homes for one year. We have achieved a 16 percent reduction in kWh per square foot of energy consumption in our U.S. stores since 2004, and our goal is to achieve a 20 percent reduction in our U.S. stores by 2015, through our energy conservation initiatives. We have also partnered with the U.S. Green Building Council and have built seven Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green certified and equivalent stores. Through our supply chain efficiencies created by the actions described above under Logistics, we are also targeting a 20 percent reduction in our domestic supply chain greenhouse gas emissions from 2008 to 2015, which would equate to annual fuel savings of approximately 25 million gallons or approximately 8,000 trips around the earths circumference. We received the 2009 Environmental Excellence Award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency SmartWay SM Transport Partnership for our leadership in conserving energy and lowering greenhouse gas emission from our supply chain activities. As the worlds largest home improvement retailer, we are in a unique position to enable our customers to achieve energy savings through our products and services. Through our Eco Options SM Program introduced in 2007, we have created product categories that allow consumers to easily identify environmentally preferred product selections in our stores. Our Eco Options SM Program has certified approximately 4,000 products that meet specifications for energy efficiency, water conservation, healthy home, clean air and sustainable forestry. During 2009, we sold more than 90 million Energy Star  refrigerators, dishwashers, compact fluorescent light bulbs, programmable thermostats, water heaters and other products, which are capable of saving our customers approximately $740 million on their utility bills. We also sold more than six million WaterSense  -labeled bath faucets, aerators and toilets, giving our customers the potential to save at least 1.8 billion gallons of water. In 2009, we also upgraded our Eco Options SM page on our website, which offers consumer education on environmental impacts of various products as well as identifying easy green D-I-Y projects. This online experience, coupled with our D-I-Y in-store how-to clinics on green projects and our continual enhancement of our Eco Options SM product categories, helps us to meet a growing customer demand for environmentally responsible and cost-saving products and projects. We continue to offer our nationwide, in-store compact fluorescent light bulb recycling program launched in June 2008. This service is offered to customers free of charge and is available in all U.S. stores. We also maintain an in-store rechargeable battery recycling program. Launched in 2001 in partnership with the Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation, this program is also available to customers free of charge in all U.S. and Canada stores. Seasonality. Our business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, and the lowest volume occurs during our fourth fiscal quarter. Competition. Our business is highly competitive, based primarily on customer service, price, store location and assortment of merchandise. In each of the markets we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. With respect to some products, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and, to a lesser  extent, other retailers. Due to the variety of competition we face, we are unable to precisely measure the impact on our sales by our competitors. ##TABLE_START ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. ##TABLE_END The risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. The Risk Factors described below include the considerable risks associated with the current economic environment and the related potential adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. You should read these Risk Factors in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item 8. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. Sustained uncertainty regarding current economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. Our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets. Adverse conditions in or sustained uncertainty about these markets could adversely impact consumer confidence, causing our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services. Other factors  including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures, interest rate fluctuations, fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs, the availability of financing, the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit, weather, natural disasters and other conditions beyond our control  could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. We operate in markets that are highly competitive. We compete principally based on customer services, price, store location and assortment of merchandise. In each market we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. With respect to some products, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and other retailers. Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors could affect prices or demand for our products and services. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through maintenance of superior customer service and customer loyalty, our financial performance and our market share could be adversely affected. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences, expectations and needs. Failure to maintain attractive stores and to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences, expectations as to service levels, spending patterns and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share.  Our success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs. Our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. To be successful, we must attract, train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates to meet the needs and expectations of our customers while at the same time controlling labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the impact of legislation or regulations governing healthcare benefits or labor relations, such as the proposed Employee Free Choice Act, and health and other insurance costs. In addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. In addition, our centralization of certain human resources functions might not be readily adapted by our associates and therefore might not provide the anticipated benefits. The inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. Prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. We rely on third party suppliers. If we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our current suppliers experience financial difficulties, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. We buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by political instability, the financial instability of suppliers (particularly in light of recent economic conditions), suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and cost and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. As part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. If we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation. If we do not maintain the security of customer, associate or company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. Any significant compromise or breach of customer, associate or company data security could significantly damage our reputation and result in additional costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits. The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. There is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches.  A failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to analyze, process and manage transactions and data. We also rely heavily on the integrity of this data in managing our business. We or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be expensive, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. The implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. We have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology. These initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers. The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. In addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether. Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal, state or local regulations. Changes in the federal, state or local minimum wage or living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations could increase our costs of doing business. In addition, changes in federal, state or local regulations governing the sale of some of our products or tax regulations could increase our costs of doing business. Passage of the Employee Free Choice Act or other similar laws in Congress could lead to higher labor costs by encouraging unionization efforts among our associates and disruption of store operations. Healthcare reform, if enacted, could also adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates. Our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if needed, could be adversely affected by the volatility in the capital markets. We obtain and manage liquidity from the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to capital markets, including our commercial paper programs supported by a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks. Although we currently maintain a strong investment grade rating and had no outstanding commercial paper obligations as of the end of fiscal 2009, there is no assurance that our ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets, if needed, will not be adversely impacted due to current economic conditions. New or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity and continued volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit, higher cost of borrowing and lack of confidence in the equity market, making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us. If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations. Our ability to successfully operate in international markets is affected by many of the same operational risks we face in our U.S. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. Our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by our inability to identify and gain access to local suppliers as well as by local laws and customs, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), other legal and regulatory constraints, political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, adverse tax consequences, greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights and risks associated with FCPA and local anti-bribery law compliance. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations.  If we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business, we could be subject to fines and lawsuits. We act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our D-I-F-M customers through third-party installers. As such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of our third-party installers. We have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction. If we fail to manage these processes effectively, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive verdicts. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of managements attention and resources from other matters. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Of our 2,244 stores operating at the end of fiscal 2009, approximately 89% were owned (including those owned subject to a ground lease) consisting of approximately 209.4 million square feet, and approximately 11% of such stores were leased consisting of approximately 25.8 million square feet. At the end of fiscal 2009, we utilized 188 warehouses and distribution centers located in 33 states or provinces, consisting of approximately 32.1 million square feet, of which approximately 0.2 million is owned and approximately 31.9 million is leased. Our executive, corporate staff, divisional staff and financial offices occupy approximately 2.1 million square feet of leased and owned space in Atlanta, Georgia. At the end of fiscal 2009, we occupied an aggregate of approximately 3.7 million square feet, of which approximately 2.4 million square feet is owned and approximately 1.3 million square feet is leased, for store support centers and customer support centers.  ##TABLE_START ", "3": " Item 3. Legal Proceedings. ##TABLE_END In July 2005, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office in Los Angeles, California, seeking documents and information relating to the Companys handling, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. The Company is cooperating fully with the United States Attorneys Office. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding, it does not expect any such outcome to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. In August 2005, the Company received an informal request from the staff of the SEC for information related to the Companys return-to-vendor policies and procedures. Subsequent to August 2005, the SEC staff requested additional information related to those policies and procedures. The SEC staff last contacted the Company regarding this matter in January 2007. The Company responded to the requests and will continue to fully cooperate with the SEC staff. The SEC has informed the Company that the informal inquiry is not an indication that any violations of law have occurred. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of this matter, it does not expect that this informal inquiry will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The following actions have been filed against the Company and, in some cases, against certain of its current and former officers and directors as described below. Although the Company cannot predict their outcome, it does not expect these actions, individually or together, will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. As previously reported, in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2006, three purported, but uncertified, class actions were filed against the Company, The Home Depot FutureBuilder Administrative Committee and certain of the Companys current and former directors and employees alleging breach of fiduciary duty in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) in connection with the Companys return-to-vendor and stock option practices. These actions were joined into one case in 2007, and the joint amended complaint seeks certification as a class action, unspecified damages, costs, attorneys fees and equitable and injunctive relief. The case is currently before the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in Atlanta, following the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in July 2008 reversing the District Courts prior decision on standing, affirming its finding that the plaintiffs failed to exhaust the administrative remedies provided under ERISA, and remanding the matter to the District Court for further adjudication. On November 9, 2009, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint following their pursuit of administrative remedies. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of this matter, it does not expect the outcome to have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. On January 27, 2010, the Superior Court of the County of Los Angeles in California approved the Companys settlement with the plaintiffs in five lawsuits containing multiple class-action allegations that the Company failed to provide meal breaks. The complaints were filed by current and former hourly associates from the first quarter of 2004 through the fourth quarter of 2008. The disposition of this matter is now complete. As previously disclosed, the Company established a reserve for this settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The settlement did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations. ##TABLE_START Item 4.

Participants in the Plans may also surrender shares as payment of applicable tax withholding on the vesting of restricted stock and deferred share awards. Shares so surrendered by participants in the Plans are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the Plans and applicable award agreements and not pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) The Companys common stock repurchase program was initially announced on July 15, 2002.

NonEmployee Directors Deferred Stock Compensation Plan pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The deferred stock units were credited to the accounts of those nonemployee directors who elected to receive board retainers in the form of deferred stock units instead of cash during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company credited 41,675 deferred stock units to participant accounts under The Home Depot FutureBuilder Restoration Plan pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for involuntary, non-contributory plans. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following the termination of services as described in this plan. ##TABLE_START ", "6": " Item 6. Selected Financial Data. ##TABLE_END The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to pages F-1 and F-2 of this report.  ##TABLE_START ", "7": " Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ##TABLE_END Executive Summary and Selected Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data For fiscal year ended January 31, 2010 (fiscal 2009), we reported Net Earnings of $2.7 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $1.57 compared to Net Earnings of $2.3 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $1.34 for fiscal year ended February 1, 2009 (fiscal 2008). The results for fiscal 2009 and 2008 reflect the impact of several strategic actions initiated in fiscal 2008. These strategic actions resulted in store rationalization charges related to the closing of 15 underperforming stores and the removal of approximately 50 stores from our new store pipeline, business rationalization charges related to the exit of our EXPO, THD Design Center, Yardbirds and HD Bath businesses (the Exited Businesses) and charges related to the restructuring of support functions (collectively, the Rationalization Charges). These actions resulted in pretax Rationalization Charges of $146 million and $951 million for fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our fiscal 2009 and 2008 results included a pretax charge of $163 million in each year to write-down our investment in HD Supply, Inc. Additionally, fiscal 2009 included earnings of $41 million from discontinued operations, net of tax, compared to a loss of $52 million from discontinued operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2008 for the settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of HD Supply. We reported Earnings from Continuing Operations of $2.6 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations of $1.55 for fiscal 2009 compared to Earnings from Continuing Operations of $2.3 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations of $1.37 for fiscal 2008. Excluding the Rationalization Charges and the write-downs of our investment in HD Supply, Earnings from Continuing Operations were $2.8 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $1.66 for fiscal 2009 compared to Earnings from Continuing Operations of $3.0 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations of $1.78 for fiscal 2008. Net Sales decreased 7.2% to $66.2 billion for fiscal 2009 from $71.3 billion for fiscal 2008. The slowdown in the global economy and weakness in the U.S. residential construction, housing and home improvement markets negatively impacted our Net Sales for fiscal 2009. Our comparable store sales declined 6.6% in fiscal 2009 driven by a 6.3% decline in our comparable store average ticket to $51.65, as well as a 0.3% decline in comparable store customer transactions. Comparable store sales for our U.S. stores declined 6.2% in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, we continued to focus on our core retail business, investing in our associates and stores and improving our customer service. The roll-out of our Customers FIRST training to all store associates and support staff in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 has brought simplification and focus across the business, and we are seeing the benefit of this in improved customer service ratings for fiscal 2009. We also made significant progress on our merchandising tools in the U.S. that helped us to better manage markdown and clearance activity and to better control inventory. At the end of fiscal 2009, our inventory had decreased by $485 million, or 4.5%, from fiscal 2008. Additionally, our average inventory per store decreased by 3.3% at the end of fiscal 2009 compared to last year. We continued our supply chain transformation to improve product availability. At the end of fiscal 2009, we had 12 Rapid Deployment Centers (RDCs) operating that serve approximately 65% of our U.S. stores. We remain committed to our overall RDC roll-out strategy, supporting our goal of increasing our central distribution penetration. Our supply chain transformation also includes restructuring our stocking distribution centers. We opened 13 new stores in fiscal 2009, closed two stores in China and closed 41 stores related to our Exited Businesses, bringing our total store count at the end of fiscal 2009 to 2,244. As of the end of fiscal 2009, a total of 268 stores, or approximately 12%, were located in Canada, Mexico and China compared to 262 stores, or approximately 12%, as of fiscal 2008.  We generated $5.1 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2009. We used a portion of this cash flow to repay $1.8 billion of Long-Term Debt, pay $1.5 billion of dividends, fund $966 million in capital expenditures and fund $213 million of share repurchases. At the end of fiscal 2009, our long-term debt-to-equity ratio was 44.7% compared to 54.4% at the end of fiscal 2008. Our return on invested capital for continuing operations (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 10.7% at the end of fiscal 2009 compared to 9.5% for fiscal 2008. Excluding Rationalization Charges, our return on invested capital for continuing operations was 11.1% for fiscal 2009 compared to 11.4% for fiscal 2008.  We believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations. ##TABLE_START   % of Net Sales   % Increase (Decrease) In Dollar Amounts    Fiscal Year (1)    2009   2008   2007   2009 vs. 2008   2008 vs. 2007  NET SALES   100.0 %   100.0 %   100.0 %  (7.2 )%  (7.8 )% Gross Profit   33.9    33.7    33.6   (6.6 )  (7.7 ) Operating Expenses:      Selling, General and Administrative   24.0    25.0    22.1   (10.9 )  4.7  Depreciation and Amortization   2.6    2.5    2.2   (4.4 )  4.9                    Total Operating Expenses   26.6    27.5    24.3   (10.3 )  4.7                    OPERATING INCOME   7.3    6.1    9.4   10.2   (39.8 ) Interest and Other (Income) Expense:      Interest and Investment Income           (0.1 )  0.0   (75.7 ) Interest Expense   1.0    0.9    0.9   8.3   (10.3 ) Other   0.2    0.2       0.0   0.0                    Interest and Other, net   1.2    1.1    0.8   6.8   23.6                    EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES   6.0    5.0    8.6   10.9   (45.8 ) Provision for Income Taxes   2.1    1.8    3.1   6.6   (47.0 )                   EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS   4.0 %   3.2 %   5.4 %  13.3 %  (45.1 )%                   SELECTED SALES DATA      Number of Customer Transactions (in millions) (2)   1,274    1,272    1,336   0.2 %  (4.8 )% Average Ticket (2)  $ 51.76   $ 55.61   $ 57.48   (6.9 )  (3.3 ) Weighted Average Weekly Sales per Operating Store (in thousands) (2)  $ 563   $ 601   $ 658   (6.3 )  (8.7 ) Weighted Average Sales per Square Foot (2)  $ 278.97   $ 298.19   $ 331.86   (6.4 )  (10.1 ) Comparable Store Sales Decrease (%) (3)   (6.6 )%   (8.7 )%   (6.7 )%  N/A   N/A  ##TABLE_END Note: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding. ##TABLE_START (1) Fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 refer to the fiscal years ended January 31, 2010, February 1, 2009 and February 3, 2008, respectively.

Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Net Sales Net Sales for fiscal 2009 decreased 7.2% to $66.2 billion from $71.3 billion for fiscal 2008. The decrease in Net Sales for fiscal 2009 reflects the impact of negative comparable store sales as well as the net impact of fewer open stores in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008. Total comparable store sales decreased 6.6% for fiscal 2009 compared to a decrease of 8.7% for fiscal 2008. There were a number of factors that contributed to our comparable store sales decline. The U.S. residential construction, housing and home improvement markets continued to be soft, and consumers were challenged due to a number of factors including higher unemployment. We saw relative strength in our Building Materials, Flooring, Paint, Plumbing and Garden/Seasonal product categories as comparable store sales in these areas were above the Company average for fiscal 2009. Comparable store sales for our Lumber, Hardware, Electrical, Kitchen/Bath and Millwork product categories were below the Company average for fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, we also saw significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against all currencies. Fluctuating exchange rates negatively impacted our total Company sales by approximately $565 million for fiscal 2009 compared to last year. We believe that our sales performance has been, and could continue to be, negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets. We estimate our share of the U.S. home improvement market is approximately 21%. Gross Profit Gross Profit decreased 6.6% to $22.4 billion for fiscal 2009 from $24.0 billion for fiscal 2008. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 33.9% for fiscal 2009 compared to 33.7% for fiscal 2008, an increase of 22 basis points. Through our focused bay portfolio approach, our U.S. merchants continued to introduce new lower prices while growing overall gross margin. Additionally, gross margin expansion for fiscal 2009 was driven by lower markdowns as compared to last year. Operating Expenses Selling, General and Administrative expenses (SGA) decreased 10.9% to $15.9 billion for fiscal 2009 from $17.8 billion for fiscal 2008. As a percent of Net Sales, SGA was 24.0% for fiscal 2009 compared to 25.0% for fiscal 2008. Excluding the Rationalization Charges, SGA as a percent of Net Sales was 23.9% for fiscal 2009 compared to 23.7% for fiscal 2008. Our SGA results for fiscal 2009 reflect the impact of a negative comparable store sales environment, offset by a lower cost of credit associated with the private label credit card program and solid expense control. For fiscal 2009, the penetration of the private label credit card sales was 25.1% compared to 28.1% for fiscal 2008. Depreciation and Amortization decreased 4.4% to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2009 from $1.8 billion for fiscal 2008. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.6% for fiscal 2009 and 2.5% for fiscal 2008. The increase in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to lower sales. Operating Income Operating Income increased 10.2% to $4.8 billion for fiscal 2009 from $4.4 billion for fiscal 2008. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 7.3% for fiscal 2009 compared to 6.1% for fiscal 2008. Excluding the  Rationalization Charges, Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 7.5% for fiscal 2009 compared to 7.4% for fiscal 2008. Interest and Other, net In fiscal 2009, we recognized $821 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $769 million in fiscal 2008. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 1.2% for fiscal 2009 compared to 1.1% for fiscal 2008. Interest and Other, net, reflects a $163 million charge in each of fiscal 2009 and 2008 to write-down our investment in HD Supply. Excluding these charges, Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 1.0% for fiscal 2009 compared to 0.9% for fiscal 2008. The increase in Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to lower sales. Provision for Income Taxes Our combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 34.2% for fiscal 2009 from 35.6% for fiscal 2008. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 reflects benefits arising from a favorable foreign tax settlement and realignment of our foreign corporate structure. These benefits positively impacted Diluted Earnings per Share by approximately $0.06 for fiscal 2009. Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $1.55 for fiscal 2009 and $1.37 for fiscal 2008. Excluding the Rationalization Charges and the write-downs of our investment in HD Supply, Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations for fiscal 2009 were $1.66 compared to $1.78 for fiscal 2008, a decrease of 6.7%. Discontinued Operations On August 30, 2007, the Company closed the sale of HD Supply. Discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 consist of earnings of $41 million, net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $52 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share in fiscal 2008, in each case for the settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of HD Supply. Non-GAAP Measures To provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance for fiscal 2009 and 2008, we supplement our reporting with non-GAAP financial measures to reflect adjustments for the Rationalization Charges as described more fully in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the Net Sales from Exited Businesses during the period from closing announcement to actual closing, and the charges to write-down our investment in HD Supply as described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures.  The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures for fiscal 2009 and 2008 (amounts in millions, except per share data): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2010    As Reported  Adjustments   Non-GAAP Measures  % of Net Sales  Net Sales  $ 66,176  $ 221   $ 65,955  100.0 % Cost of Sales   43,764   193    43,571  66.1               Gross Profit   22,412   28    22,384  33.9  Operating Expenses:     Selling, General and Administrative   15,902   170    15,732  23.9  Depreciation and Amortization   1,707   4    1,703  2.6               Total Operating Expenses   17,609   174    17,435  26.4               Operating Income   4,803   (146 )   4,949  7.5  Interest and Other, net   821   163    658  1.0               Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes   3,982   (309 )   4,291  6.5  Provision for Income Taxes   1,362   (118 )   1,480  2.2               Earnings from Continuing Operations  $ 2,620  $ (191 )  $ 2,811  4.3 %              Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations  $ 1.55  $ (0.11 )  $ 1.66  N/A               ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2009    As Reported  Adjustments   Non-GAAP Measures  % of Net Sales  Net Sales  $ 71,288  $    $ 71,288  100.0 % Cost of Sales   47,298   30    47,268  66.3               Gross Profit   23,990   (30 )   24,020  33.7  Operating Expenses     Selling, General and Administrative   17,846   918    16,928  23.7  Depreciation and Amortization   1,785   3    1,782  2.5               Total Operating Expenses   19,631   921    18,710  26.2               Operating Income   4,359   (951 )   5,310  7.4  Interest and Other, net   769   163    606  0.9               Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes   3,590   (1,114 )   4,704  6.6  Provision for Income Taxes   1,278   (430 )   1,708  2.4               Earnings from Continuing Operations  $ 2,312  $ (684 )  $ 2,996  4.2 %              Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations  $ 1.37  $ (0.41 )  $ 1.78  N/A               ##TABLE_END  Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended February 3, 2008 (fiscal 2007) Net Sales Fiscal 2008 consisted of 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2007. Net Sales for fiscal 2008 decreased 7.8% to $71.3 billion from $77.3 billion for fiscal 2007. The decrease in Net Sales for fiscal 2008 reflects the impact of negative comparable store sales and $1.1 billion of Net Sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2007, partially offset by Net Sales of $1.8 billion from new stores in fiscal 2008. Comparable store sales decreased 8.7% for fiscal 2008 compared to a decrease of 6.7% for fiscal 2007. There were a number of factors that contributed to our comparable store sales decline. The U.S. residential construction and home improvement markets continued to be soft and consumers were challenged due to higher unemployment and an across-the-board tightening of consumer credit availability. We saw relative strength in Building Materials, Plumbing, Garden/Seasonal and Hardware as comparable store sales in these areas were above or at the Company average for fiscal 2008. Comparable store sales for Lumber, Flooring, Paint, Electrical, Kitchen/Bath and Millwork were below the Company average for fiscal 2008. Softness in our big ticket categories negatively impacted average ticket, which decreased 3.3% to $55.61 for fiscal 2008. Our new stores cannibalized approximately 5% of our existing stores as of the end of fiscal 2008, which had a negative impact to comparable store sales of approximately 1%. Gross Profit Gross Profit decreased 7.7% to $24.0 billion for fiscal 2008 from $26.0 billion for fiscal 2007. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 33.7% for fiscal 2008 compared to 33.6% for fiscal 2007, an increase of four basis points. This gross margin expansion included $30 million in markdowns taken in connection with our Rationalization Charges. Excluding these markdowns, our Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales increased eight basis points for fiscal 2008, reflecting our focused bay portfolio approach to product assortment. Operating Expenses SGA increased 4.7% to $17.8 billion for fiscal 2008 from $17.1 billion for fiscal 2007. As a percent of Net Sales, SGA was 25.0% for fiscal 2008 compared to 22.1% for fiscal 2007. Excluding the Rationalization Charges, SGA as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2008 was 23.7%, an increase of approximately 170 basis points over the prior year. The increase in SGA as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of expense deleverage in the negative comparable store sales environment, as well as an increase of approximately 70 basis points due to a higher cost of credit associated with the private label credit card program. For fiscal 2008, the penetration of the private label credit card sales was 28.1% compared to 29.4% for fiscal 2007. Depreciation and Amortization increased 4.9% to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2008 from $1.7 billion for fiscal 2007. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.5% for fiscal 2008 and 2.2% for fiscal 2007. The increase as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to sales deleverage and the depreciation of our investments in shorter lived assets such as store resets and technology. Operating Income Operating Income decreased 39.8% to $4.4 billion for fiscal 2008 from $7.2 billion for fiscal 2007. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 6.1% for fiscal 2008 compared to 9.4% for fiscal 2007. Excluding the Rationalization Charges, Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 7.4% for fiscal 2008. Interest and Other, net In fiscal 2008, we recognized $769 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $622 million in fiscal 2007. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 1.1% for fiscal 2008 compared to 0.8% for fiscal 2007.  Interest and Other, net, reflects a $163 million charge to write-down our investment in HD Supply. Excluding this charge, Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.9% for fiscal 2008. Provision for Income Taxes Our combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 35.6% for fiscal 2008 from 36.4% for fiscal 2007. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2008 reflects lower state and foreign effective tax rates. Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $1.37 for fiscal 2008 and $2.27 for fiscal 2007. Excluding the Rationalization Charges and the write-down of our investment in HD Supply, Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations for fiscal 2008 were $1.78, a decrease of 21.6% from fiscal 2007. The 53 rd week in fiscal 2007 increased Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations by approximately $0.04 for fiscal 2007. Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were favorably impacted by the repurchase of shares of our common stock. We repurchased 2.4 million shares for $70 million in fiscal 2008 and 293 million shares for $10.8 billion in fiscal 2007. Discontinued Operations On August 30, 2007, the Company closed the sale of HD Supply. Discontinued operations for fiscal 2008 consist of a loss of $52 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share, related to the settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of HD Supply. Discontinued operations for fiscal 2007 consist of the results of operations for HD Supply through August 30, 2007 and a $4 million loss on the sale of HD Supply. Net Sales from discontinued operations were $7.4 billion for fiscal 2007 and Earnings from Discontinued Operations, net of tax, were $185 million for fiscal 2007. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. For fiscal 2009, Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $5.1 billion compared to $5.5 billion for fiscal 2008. This change was a result of lower earnings excluding noncash impairment charges and reduced cash flows from working capital items. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities for fiscal 2009 was $755 million compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of $881 million less in Capital Expenditures in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, we spent $966 million on Capital Expenditures, allocated as follows: 26% for merchandising and operations, 19% for maintenance, 19% for core technology, 15% for new stores and 21% for other initiatives. In fiscal 2009, we added 13 new stores. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities for fiscal 2009 was $3.5 billion compared with $3.7 billion for fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily due to repayments in fiscal 2008 of $1.7 billion of short-term commercial paper and $282 million of structured financing debt compared to $1.8 billion in Repayments of Long-Term Debt in fiscal 2009. We repurchased 7.7 million shares of our common stock for $213 million in fiscal 2009 and 2.4 million shares for $70 million in fiscal 2008. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2002, we have repurchased 753.6 million shares of our common stock for a total of $27.5 billion. As of January 31, 2010, $12.5 billion remained under our share repurchase authorization. We have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $3.25 billion. In connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $3.25 billion. As  of January 31, 2010, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility. The credit facility expires in December 2010 and contains various restrictive covenants. As of January 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. In August 2009, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for the potential future issuance of debt securities, replacing a shelf registration statement that had expired. We use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers and store support centers. The net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-Term Debt and Current Installments of Long-Term Debt. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of the end of fiscal 2009, our long-term debt-to-equity ratio was 44.7% compared to 54.4% at the end of fiscal 2008. As of January 31, 2010, we guaranteed a $1.0 billion senior secured amortizing term loan (guaranteed loan) in connection with the sale of HD Supply. The fair value of the guarantee, which was determined to be approximately $16 million, is recorded as a liability and included in Other Long-Term Liabilities. We are responsible for up to $1.0 billion and any unpaid interest in the event of nonpayment by HD Supply. The guaranteed loan is collateralized by certain assets of HD Supply. The original expiration date of the guarantee was August 30, 2012. On March 19, 2010, we amended the expiration date and extended it to April 1, 2014. As of January 31, 2010, we had $1.4 billion in Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments. We believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. At January 31, 2010, we had outstanding interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, that expire on December 16, 2013 with a notional amount of $1.25 billion that swap fixed rate interest on our $1.25 billion 5.25% Senior Notes for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 259 basis points. At January 31, 2010, the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of $12 million, which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreements. In November 2009, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $500 million, accounted for as a cash flow hedge, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of issuing long-term debt to refinance debt maturing in fiscal 2010. At January 31, 2010, the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $3 million, which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement. During fiscal 2008 and 2007, we entered into interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, with notional amounts of $3.0 billion, that swapped fixed rate interest on our $3.0 billion 5.40% Senior Notes for variable rate interest equal to LIBOR plus 60 to 149 basis points. In fiscal 2008, we received $56 million to settle these swaps, which is being amortized to reduce net Interest Expense over the remaining term of the debt. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of January 31, 2010 (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual Obligations  Total  2010  2011-2012  2013-2014  Thereafter Total Debt (1)  $ 15,495  $ 1,476  $ 1,824  $ 2,017  $ 10,178 Capital Lease Obligations (2)   1,242   90   180   177   795 Operating Leases   8,536   802   1,357   1,119   5,258 Purchase Obligations (3)   5,073   1,494   1,779   1,769   31 Unrecognized Tax Benefits (4)   23   23                         Total  $ 30,369  $ 3,885  $ 5,140  $ 5,082  $ 16,262                ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Excludes present value of capital lease obligations of $408 million.

Purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4) Excludes $636 million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. ##TABLE_END Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. Interest rate swap agreements are used, at times, to manage our fixed/floating debt portfolio. At January 31, 2010, after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, approximately 87% of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate debt and 13% was floating-rate debt. A 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our results of operations. As of January 31, 2010 we had, net of discounts, $9.3 billion of Senior Notes outstanding. The aggregate market value of the publicly traded Senior Notes as of January 31, 2010, was approximately $9.5 billion. Although we have international operating entities, our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition or results of operations. Impact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices We have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates.  Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. We have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. However, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely impacted. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. We also record Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. Merchandise Inventories Our Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, with approximately 82% valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method. Retailers like The Home Depot, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, Merchandise Inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. We evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the end of fiscal 2009 or 2008. Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, swell) is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. We estimate shrink as a percent of Net Sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. The estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007. Self-Insurance We are self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, product liability, automobile, workers compensation and medical claims. Our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates, and is reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation, or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007. Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. We believe that our estimate  of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors. Volume rebates and advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in SGA. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, managements decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, we also recognize in SGA the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of long-lived assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition and inflation. A 10% decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations. Our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations. As part of our Rationalization Charges, we recorded no asset impairment and $84 million of lease obligation costs in fiscal 2009 compared to $580 million of asset impairments and $252 million of lease obligation costs in fiscal 2008. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the Rationalization Charges. A 10% decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10% increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on results of operations. We also recorded impairments on other closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill, but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. The fair values of our identified reporting units were estimated using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows. We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition, inflation and discount rates. A 10% decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting units tested would result in an impairment that is not material to our results of operations. A 1.0 percentage point  increase in the discount rate used would also result in an impairment that is not material to our results of operations. We amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range from 1 to 20 years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. We recorded no impairment charges for goodwill or other intangible assets for fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (FASB ASC 105-10), which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the sole source for authoritative U.S. GAAP and supersedes all accounting standards in U.S. GAAP, aside from those issued by the SEC. FASB ASC 105-10 was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of the Codification did not have an impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. In accordance with the Codification, references to previously issued accounting standards have been replaced by FASB ASC references. In June 2009, the FASB issued Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FASB ASC 810-10), which clarifies that the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an entitys purpose and design and a companys ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. FASB ASC 810-10 requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and eliminates the qualifying special purpose entity concept. FASB ASC 810-10 also requires additional disclosures about a companys involvement in variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. This guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued guidance to clarify that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and are to be included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. This guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. This guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " Item 7A.

These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and properly reflect certain estimates and judgments based upon the best available information. The financial statements of the Company have been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their accompanying report is based upon an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting solely of independent directors, meets five times a year with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and representatives of management to discuss auditing and financial reporting matters. In addition, a telephonic meeting is held prior to each quarterly earnings release. The Audit Committee retains the independent registered public accounting firm and regularly reviews the internal accounting controls, the activities of the independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors and the financial condition of the Company. Both the Companys independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2010 based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2010 in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2010 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included on page 30 in this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START /s/ F RANCIS S.

Tom Chief Financial Officer  Executive Vice President  Corporate Services ##TABLE_END  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders The Home Depot, Inc.: We have audited The Home Depot Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Home Depot Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, The Home Depot, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 31, 2010 and February 1, 2009, and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Stockholders Equity and Comprehensive Income, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2010, and our report dated March 25, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/ KPMG LLP Atlanta, Georgia March 25, 2010  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders The Home Depot, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 31, 2010 and February 1, 2009, and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Stockholders Equity and Comprehensive Income, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2010. These Consolidated Financial Statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Consolidated Financial Statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ##TABLE_END Business, Consolidation and Presentation The Home Depot, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) operate The Home Depot stores, which are full-service, warehouse-style stores averaging approximately 105,000 square feet in size. The stores stock approximately 30,000 to 40,000 different kinds of building materials, home improvement supplies and lawn and garden products that are sold to do-it-yourself customers, do-it-for-me customers and professional customers. At the end of fiscal 2009, the Company was operating 2,244 stores, which included 1,976 The Home Depot stores in the United States, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam (U.S.), 179 The Home Depot stores in Canada, 79 The Home Depot stores in Mexico and 10 The Home Depot stores in China. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31. Fiscal years ended January 31, 2010 (fiscal 2009) and February 1, 2009 (fiscal 2008) include 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended February 3, 2008 (fiscal 2007) includes 53 weeks. Use of Estimates Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses in preparing these financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Receivables and Accounts Payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments. The fair value of the Companys investments is discussed under the caption Short-Term Investments in this Note 1. The fair value of the Companys Long-Term Debt is discussed in Note 11. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Companys Cash Equivalents are carried at fair market value and consist primarily of high-grade commercial paper, money market funds and U.S. government agency securities. Short-Term Investments Short-Term Investments are recorded at fair value based on current market rates and are classified as available-for-sale. Accounts Receivable The Company has an agreement with a third-party service provider who directly extends credit to customers, manages the Companys private label credit card program and owns the related receivables. We evaluated the third-party entities holding the receivables under the program and concluded that they should not be consolidated by the Company. The agreement with the third-party service provider expires in 2018, with the Company having the option, but no obligation, to purchase the receivables at the end of the agreement. The deferred interest charges incurred by the Company for its deferred financing programs offered to its customers are included in Cost of Sales. The interchange fees charged to the Company for the customers use of the cards  and the profit sharing with the third-party administrator are included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses (SGA). The sum of the three is referred to by the Company as the cost of credit of the private label credit card program. In addition, certain subsidiaries of the Company extend credit directly to customers in the ordinary course of business. The receivables due from customers were $38 million and $37 million as of January 31, 2010 and February 1, 2009, respectively. The Companys valuation reserve related to accounts receivable was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of the end of fiscal 2009 or 2008. Merchandise Inventories The majority of the Companys Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, as determined by the retail inventory method. As the inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, the inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Certain subsidiaries, including retail operations in Canada, Mexico and China, and distribution centers, record Merchandise Inventories at the lower of cost or market, as determined by a cost method. These Merchandise Inventories represent approximately 18% of the total Merchandise Inventories balance. The Company evaluates the inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of the end of fiscal 2009 or 2008. Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in stores, the Company accrues for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis based on historical shrink results and current trends in the business. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, swell) is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. Income Taxes The Company provides for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as for those deferred due to timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Non-U.S. subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, are not eligible to be included in the Companys consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Separate provisions for income taxes have been determined for these entities. The Company intends to reinvest substantially all of the unremitted earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries and postpone their remittance indefinitely. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes for these non-U.S. subsidiaries was recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  Depreciation and Amortization The Companys Buildings, Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold Improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the original term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. The Companys Property and Equipment is depreciated using the following estimated useful lives: ##TABLE_START   Life Buildings  5  45 years Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment  3  20 years Leasehold Improvements  5  45 years ##TABLE_END Capitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to six years. These costs are included in Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred. Revenues The Company recognizes revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. The liability for sales returns is estimated based on historical return levels. When the Company receives payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. The Company also records Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognizes this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. Gift card breakage income is recognized based upon historical redemption patterns and represents the balance of gift cards for which the Company believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized $40 million, $37 million and $36 million, respectively, of gift card breakage income. This income is recorded as other income and is included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a reduction in SGA. Services Revenue Net Sales include services revenue generated through a variety of installation, home maintenance and professional service programs. In these programs, the customer selects and purchases material for a project and the Company provides or arranges professional installation. These programs are offered through the Companys stores. Under certain programs, when the Company provides or arranges the installation of a project and the subcontractor provides material as part of the installation, both the material and labor are included in services revenue. The Company recognizes this revenue when the service for the customer is complete. All payments received prior to the completion of services are recorded in Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Services revenue was $2.6 billion, $3.1 billion and $3.5 billion for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Self-Insurance The Company is self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, product liability, automobile, workers compensation and medical claims. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date is not discounted and is recognized as a liability. The expected ultimate cost of claims is estimated based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates.  Prepaid Advertising Television and radio advertising production costs, along with media placement costs, are expensed when the advertisement first appears. Amounts included in Other Current Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to prepayments of production costs for print and broadcast advertising as well as sponsorship promotions were not material at the end of fiscal 2009 and 2008. Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and certain advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, gross advertising expense was $897 million, $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, and is included in SGA. Specific, incremental and identifiable advertising co-op allowances were $105 million, $107 million and $120 million for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and were recorded as an offset to advertising expense in SGA. Cost of Sales Cost of Sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed, the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to the Companys stores, locations or customers, the operating cost of the Companys sourcing and distribution network and the cost of deferred interest programs offered through the Companys private label credit card program. The cost of handling and shipping merchandise from the Companys stores, locations or distribution centers to the customer is classified as SGA. The cost of shipping and handling, including internal costs and payments to third parties, classified as SGA was $426 million, $501 million and $571 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates its long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, managements decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, the Company also recognizes in SGA the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. As part of its Rationalization Charges, the Company recorded no asset impairment and $84 million of lease obligation costs in fiscal 2009 compared to $580 million of asset impairments and $252 million of lease obligation costs in fiscal 2008. See Note 2 for more details on the Rationalization Charges. The Company also  recorded impairments on other closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. The Company does not amortize goodwill, but does assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. The fair values of the Companys identified reporting units were estimated using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows. The Company amortizes the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range from 1 to 20 years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. The Company recorded no impairment charges for goodwill or other intangible assets for fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007. Stock-Based Compensation The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $6.61, $6.46 and $9.45, respectively. The fair value of these options was determined at the date of grant using the Black- Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended   January 31, 2010  February 1, 2009  February 3, 2008 Risk-free interest rate  2.3%  2.9%  4.4% Assumed volatility  41.5%  33.8%  25.5% Assumed dividend yield  3.9%  3.5%  2.4% Assumed lives of option  6 years  6 years  6 years ##TABLE_END Derivatives The Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate exposure on long-term debt and its exposure on foreign currency fluctuations. The Company accounts for its derivative financial instruments in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC) 815-10. The fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments is discussed in Note 5. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive Income includes Net Earnings adjusted for certain revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are excluded from Net Earnings under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Adjustments to Net Earnings and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income consist primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and Liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses are generally translated using average exchange rates for the period and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the day of the transaction. Segment Information The Company operates within a single reportable segment primarily within North America. Net Sales for the Company outside of the U.S. were $7.0 billion for fiscal 2009 and were $7.4 billion for fiscal 2008 and 2007. Long-lived assets outside of the U.S. totaled $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion as of January 31, 2010 and February 1, 2009, respectively.  ##TABLE_START 2. RATIONALIZATION CHARGES ##TABLE_END In fiscal 2008, the Company reduced its square footage growth plans to improve free cash flow, provide stronger returns for the Company and invest in its existing stores to continue improving the customer experience. As a result of this store rationalization plan, the Company determined that it would no longer pursue the opening of approximately 50 U.S. stores that had been in its new store pipeline. The Company expects to dispose of or sublet these pipeline locations over varying periods. The Company also closed 15 underperforming U.S. stores in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, and the Company expects to dispose of or sublet those locations over varying periods. Also in fiscal 2008, the Company announced that it would exit its EXPO, THD Design Center, Yardbirds and HD Bath businesses (the Exited Businesses) in order to focus on its core The Home Depot stores. The Company closed the Exited Businesses in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and expects to dispose of or sublet those locations over varying periods. These steps impacted approximately 5,000 associates in those locations, their support functions and their distribution centers. Finally, in January 2009 the Company restructured its support functions to better align the Companys cost structure. These actions impacted approximately 2,000 associates. The Company recognized $146 million and $951 million in total pretax charges for fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to these actions (collectively, the Rationalization Charges). The significant components of the total expected charges and charges incurred to date are as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Total Expected Charges  Fiscal 2008 Charges  Fiscal 2009 Charges  Estimated Remaining Charges Asset impairments  $ 580  $ 580  $   $  Lease obligation costs, net   336   252   84    Severance   86   78   8    Other   95   41   54                Total  $ 1,097  $ 951  $ 146  $              ##TABLE_END Inventory markdown costs reflected in Other are included in Cost of Sales in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings, and costs related to asset impairments, lease obligations, severance and other miscellaneous costs are included in SGA expenses. Asset impairment charges, including contractual costs to complete certain assets, were determined based on fair market value using market data for each individual property. Lease obligation costs represent the present value of contractually obligated rental payments offset by estimated sublet income, including estimates of the time required to sublease the locations. The payments related to the leased locations therefore are not generally incremental uses of cash. Activity related to Rationalization Charges for fiscal 2009 and 2008 was as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2008 Charges  Cash Uses  Non-cash Uses  Accrued Balance February 1, 2009  Fiscal 2009 Charges  Cash Uses  Non-cash Uses  Accrued Balance January 31, 2010 Asset impairments  $ 580  $   $ 542  $ 38  $   $   $ 15  $ 23 Lease obligation costs, net   252   39      213   84   106      191 Severance   78   6      72   8   80       Other   41   18   3   20   54   71   3                            Total  $ 951  $ 63  $ 545  $ 343  $ 146  $ 257  $ 18  $ 214                         ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START 3. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE ##TABLE_END During fiscal 2008, the Company implemented a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, including a new inventory system, for its retail operations in Canada. Along with this implementation, the Company changed its method of accounting for Merchandise Inventories for its retail operations in Canada from the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, as determined by the retail inventory method, to the lower of cost or market using a weighted-average cost method. As of the end of fiscal 2008, the implementation of the new inventory system and related conversion to the weighted-average cost method for Canadian retail operations was complete. The new ERP system allows the Company to utilize the weighted-average cost method, which the Company believes will result in greater precision in the costing of inventories and a better matching of cost of sales with revenue generated. The effect of the change on the Merchandise Inventories and Retained Earnings balances was not material. Prior to the inventory system conversion, the Company could not determine the impact of the change to the weighted-average cost method, and therefore, could not retroactively apply the change to periods prior to fiscal 2008. ##TABLE_START 4. DISPOSITION AND ACQUISITIONS ##TABLE_END On August 30, 2007, the Company closed the sale of HD Supply. The Company received $8.3 billion of net proceeds for the sale of HD Supply and recognized a $4 million loss, net of tax, in fiscal 2007. Settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of HD Supply resulted in earnings from discontinued operations of $41 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2009 and a loss from discontinued operations of $52 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2008. In connection with the sale, the Company purchased a 12.5% equity interest in the newly formed HD Supply for $325 million. In fiscal 2008, the Company determined its 12.5% equity interest in HD Supply was impaired and recorded a $163 million charge to write-down the investment. In fiscal 2009, the Company determined its equity interest in HD Supply was further impaired and recorded an additional charge of $163 million to write-down the remaining investment. These charges are included in Interest and Other, net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Also in connection with the sale, the Company guaranteed a $1.0 billion senior secured amortizing term loan (guaranteed loan) of HD Supply. The fair value of the guarantee, which was determined to be approximately $16 million, is recorded as a liability of the Company and included in Other Long-Term Liabilities. The Company is responsible for up to $1.0 billion and any unpaid interest in the event of nonpayment by HD Supply. The guaranteed loan is collateralized by certain assets of HD Supply. The original expiration date of the guarantee was August 30, 2012. On March 19, 2010, the Company amended the expiration date and extended it to April 1, 2014. In accordance with FASB ASC 360-10, the Company reclassified the results of HD Supply as discontinued operations in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. The following table presents Net Sales and Earnings of HD Supply through August 30, 2007 and the gains and losses on disposition which have been classified as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended    January 31, 2010  February 1, 2009   February 3, 2008  Net Sales  $   $    $ 7,391             Earnings Before Provision for Income Taxes  $   $    $ 291  Provision for Income Taxes          (102 ) Gain (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, net   41   (52 )   (4 )            Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax  $ 41  $ (52 )  $ 185             ##TABLE_END  The Company made no acquisitions during fiscal 2009 and 2008. The aggregate purchase price for acquisitions in fiscal 2007 was $25 million. The Company recorded Goodwill related to the HD Supply businesses of $20 million for fiscal 2007 and recorded no Goodwill related to its retail businesses for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007. ##TABLE_START 5. DEBT ##TABLE_END The Company has commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $3.25 billion. All of the Companys short-term borrowings in fiscal 2009 and 2008 were under these commercial paper programs. In connection with the commercial paper programs, the Company has a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $3.25 billion. The credit facility expires in December 2010 and contains various restrictive covenants. At January 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact the Companys liquidity or capital resources. Short-Term Debt under the commercial paper programs was as follows (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START   January 31, 2010   February 1, 2009  Balance outstanding at fiscal year-end  $    $   Maximum amount outstanding at any month-end  $ 190   $ 1,771  Average daily short-term borrowings  $ 55   $ 403  Weighted average interest rate   1.1 %   3.4 % The Companys Long-Term Debt at the end of fiscal 2009 and 2008 consisted of the following (amounts in millions):    January 31, 2010   February 1, 2009  3.75% Senior Notes; due September 15, 2009; interest payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15  $     $999  Floating Rate Senior Notes; due December 16, 2009; interest payable on March 16, June 16, September 16 and December 16       750  4.625% Senior Notes; due August 15, 2010; interest payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15   999    998  5.20% Senior Notes; due March 1, 2011; interest payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1   1,000    1,000  5.25% Senior Notes; due December 16, 2013; interest payable semi-annually on June 16 and December 16   1,258    1,245  5.40% Senior Notes; due March 1, 2016; interest payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1   3,040    3,047  5.875% Senior Notes; due December 16, 2036; interest payable semi-annually on June 16 and December 16   2,960    2,959  Capital Lease Obligations; payable in varying installments through January 31, 2055   408    417  Other   17    19          Total debt   9,682    11,434  Less current installments   1,020    1,767          Long-Term Debt, excluding current installments  $ 8,662   $ 9,667          ##TABLE_END At January 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, that expire on December 16, 2013 with a notional amount of $1.25 billion that swap fixed rate interest on the Companys $1.25 billion 5.25% Senior Notes for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 259 basis points. At January 31, 2010, the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of $12 million, which is the estimated amount the Company would have received to settle the agreements.  In November 2009, the Company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $500 million, accounted for as a cash flow hedge, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of issuing long-term debt to refinance debt maturing in fiscal 2010. At January 31, 2010, the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $3 million, which is the estimated amount the Company would have received to settle the agreement. During fiscal 2008 and 2007, the Company entered into interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, with notional amounts of $3.0 billion, that swapped fixed rate interest on the Companys $3.0 billion 5.40% Senior Notes for variable rate interest equal to LIBOR plus 60 to 149 basis points. In fiscal 2008, the Company received $56 million to settle these swaps, which is being amortized to reduce net Interest Expense over the remaining term of the debt. The Senior Notes may be redeemed by the Company at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed, or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, if a Change in Control Triggering Event occurs, as defined by the terms of the 5.25% Senior Notes and the 5.875% Senior Notes issuance (together the December 2006 Issuance), holders of the December 2006 Issuance have the right to require the Company to redeem those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The Company is generally not limited under the indenture governing the Senior Notes in its ability to incur additional indebtedness or required to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. However, the indenture governing the Senior Notes contains various restrictive covenants, none of which is expected to impact the Companys liquidity or capital resources. At January 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding cross currency swap agreements with a notional amount of $900 million, accounted for as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency fluctuations on certain intercompany debt. At January 31, 2010, the approximate fair value of these agreements was a liability of $4 million, which is the estimated amount the Company would have paid to settle the agreements. Interest Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings is net of interest capitalized of $4 million, $20 million and $46 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Maturities of Long-Term Debt are $1.0 billion for fiscal 2010, $1.0 billion for fiscal 2011, $30 million for fiscal 2012, $1.3 billion for fiscal 2013, $33 million for fiscal 2014 and $6.3 billion thereafter.  ##TABLE_START 6. INCOME TAXES ##TABLE_END The components of Earnings from Continuing Operations before Provision for Income Taxes for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended   January 31, 2010  February 1, 2009  February 3, 2008 United States  $ 3,586  $ 3,136  $ 5,905 Foreign   396   454   715          Total  $ 3,982  $ 3,590  $ 6,620          ##TABLE_END The Provision for Income Taxes consisted of the following (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended    January 31, 2010   February 1, 2009   February 3, 2008  Current:    Federal  $ 1,157   $ 1,283   $ 2,055  State   184    198    285  Foreign   195    85    310                1,536    1,566    2,650              Deferred:    Federal   (121 )   (209 )   (242 ) State   (24 )   (56 )   17  Foreign   (29 )   (23 )   (15 )               (174 )   (288 )   (240 )             Total  $ 1,362   $ 1,278   $ 2,410              ##TABLE_END The Companys combined federal, state and foreign effective tax rates for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, net of offsets generated by federal, state and foreign tax benefits, were approximately 34.2%, 35.6% and 36.4%, respectively. The reconciliation of the Provision for Income Taxes at the federal statutory rate of 35% to the actual tax expense for the applicable fiscal years was as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended    January 31, 2010   February 1, 2009   February 3, 2008  Income taxes at federal statutory rate  $ 1,394   $ 1,257   $ 2,317  State income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit   104    92    196  Other, net   (136 )   (71 )   (103 )             Total  $ 1,362   $ 1,278   $ 2,410              ##TABLE_END  The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of January 31, 2010 and February 1, 2009, were as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   January 31, 2010   February 1, 2009  Current:   Deferred Tax Assets:   Property and equipment  $ 85   $ 85  Accrued self-insurance liabilities   109    143  Other accrued liabilities   303    204  Deferred compensation   372    286          Current Deferred Tax Assets   869    718  Deferred Tax Liabilities:   Accelerated inventory deduction   (114 )   (114 ) Other   (114 )   (118 )         Current Deferred Tax Liabilities   (228 )   (232 )         Current Deferred Tax Assets, net   641    486          Noncurrent:   Deferred Tax Assets:   Accrued self-insurance liabilities   338    317  State income taxes   123    118  Capital loss carryover   86    65  Net operating losses   74    71  Foreign tax credit carry forward   65    7  Other   291    215  Valuation allowance   (15 )   (12 )         Noncurrent Deferred Tax Assets   962    781  Deferred Tax Liabilities:   Property and equipment   (1,178 )   (1,068 ) Goodwill and other intangibles   (88 )   (78 )         Noncurrent Deferred Tax Liabilities   (1,266 )   (1,146 )         Noncurrent Deferred Tax Liabilities, net   (304 )   (365 )         Net Deferred Tax Assets (Liabilities)  $ 337   $ 121          ##TABLE_END Current deferred tax assets and current deferred tax liabilities are netted by tax jurisdiction and noncurrent deferred tax assets and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities are netted by tax jurisdiction, and are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   January 31, 2010   February 1, 2009  Other Current Assets  $ 650   $ 491  Other Assets   12    4  Other Accrued Expenses   (6 )   (5 ) Deferred Income Taxes   (319 )   (369 )         Net Deferred Tax Assets (Liabilities)  $ 337   $ 121          ##TABLE_END  The Company believes that the realization of the deferred tax assets is more likely than not, based upon the expectation that it will generate the necessary taxable income in future periods, and except for certain net operating losses discussed below, no valuation reserves have been provided. At January 31, 2010, the Company had state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, expiring at various dates from 2010 to 2028. Management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits related to the net operating losses will be realized. However, certain foreign net operating losses are in jurisdictions where the expiration period is too short to be assured of utilization. Therefore, a valuation allowance has been provided to reduce the deferred tax asset related to net operating losses to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Total valuation allowances at January 31, 2010 and February 1, 2009 were $15 million and $12 million, respectively. As a result of its sale of HD Supply, the Company incurred a tax loss, resulting in a net capital loss carryover of approximately $244 million as of January 31, 2010. A portion of the net capital loss carryover will expire if not used by 2013 and the remaining portion will expire in 2014. However, the Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits related to the capital loss carryover will be realized based on its ability to generate adequate capital gain income during the carryover period. Therefore, no valuation allowance has been provided. The Company has not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes on approximately $456 million of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries because of its intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable; however, unrecognized foreign income tax credits would be available to reduce a portion of this liability. On January 29, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10 related to uncertainty in income taxes. This guidance requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions. It further requires that a change in judgment related to prior years tax positions be recognized in the quarter of such change. This adoption reduced the Companys Retained Earnings at January 29, 2007 by $111 million. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for continuing operations is as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   January 31, 2010   February 1, 2009  Unrecognized tax benefits balance at beginning of fiscal year  $ 695   $ 608  Additions based on tax positions related to the current year   55    67  Additions for tax positions of prior years   33    231  Reductions for tax positions of prior years   (28 )   (142 ) Reductions due to settlements   (94 )   (65 ) Reductions due to lapse of statute of limitations   (2 )   (4 )         Unrecognized tax benefits balance at end of fiscal year  $ 659   $ 695          ##TABLE_END The gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31, 2010 includes $386 million of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the annual effective income tax rate. The accrual for interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions increased by approximately $41 million in fiscal 2009, decreased by $19 million in fiscal 2008 and increased by $32 million in fiscal 2007. Total accrued interest and penalties as of January 31, 2010 and February 1, 2009 are $138 million and $109 million, respectively. Interest and penalties are included in net interest expense and operating expenses, respectively. The Companys income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. The Companys U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2005, 2006 and 2007 are currently under audit by the IRS. Fiscal year 2006 is currently under audit by the Canadian tax authorities. There are also ongoing U.S.  state and local and other foreign audits covering tax years 2002 to 2008. At this time, the Company does not expect the results from any income tax audit to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. The Company believes that certain adjustments under examination in certain states will be agreed upon within the next twelve months. The Company has classified approximately $23 million of the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits as a short-term liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Final settlement of these audit issues may result in payments that are more or less than these amounts, but the Company does not anticipate the resolution of these matters will result in a material change to its consolidated financial position or results of operations. ##TABLE_START 7. EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS ##TABLE_END The Home Depot, Inc. 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (2005 Plan) and The Home Depot, Inc. 1997 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (1997 Plan and collectively with the 2005 Plan, the Plans) provide that incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, performance shares, performance units and deferred shares may be issued to selected associates, officers and directors of the Company. Under the 2005 Plan, the maximum number of shares of the Companys common stock authorized for issuance is 255 million shares, with any award other than a stock option reducing the number of shares available for issuance by 2.11 shares. As of January 31, 2010, there were 188 million shares available for future grants under the 2005 Plan. No additional equity awards may be issued from the 1997 Plan after the adoption of the 2005 Plan on May 26, 2005. Under the terms of the Plans, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options must have an exercise price at or above the fair market value of the Companys stock on the date of the grant. Typically, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options vest at the rate of 25% per year commencing on the first or second anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth anniversary date of the grant. Certain of the non-qualified stock options also include performance options which vest on the later of the first anniversary date of the grant and the date the closing price of the Companys common stock has been 25% greater than the exercise price of the options for 30 consecutive trading days. Additionally, certain stock options may become non-forfeitable upon age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The Company recognized $19 million, $47 million and $61 million of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to stock options. Restrictions on the restricted stock issued under the Plans generally lapse according to one of the following schedules: (1) the restrictions on the restricted stock lapse over various periods up to five years, (2) the restrictions on 25% of the restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing upon the associates attainment of age 62, or (3) the restrictions on 25% of the restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing upon the earlier of the associates attainment of age 60 or the tenth anniversary date. The Company has also granted performance shares under the Plans, the payout of which is dependent on either (1) the Companys total shareholder return percentile ranking compared to the performance of individual companies included in the SP 500 index at the end of the three-year performance cycle, or (2) the Companys performance against target average return on invested capital and operating profit over a three-year performance cycle. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon the attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The fair value of the restricted stock and performance shares is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and performance shares of $158 million, $109 million and $122 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, there were an aggregate of 666 thousand, 641 thousand and 593 thousand deferred shares, respectively, granted under the Plans. For associates, each deferred share entitles the individual to one share of common stock to be received up to five years after the grant date of the deferred shares, subject to certain deferral rights of the associate. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The Company recorded stock-based  compensation expense related to deferred shares of $14 million, $9 million and $10 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of January 31, 2010, there were 2.5 million non-qualified stock options outstanding under non-qualified stock option plans that are not part of the Plans. The Company maintains two Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) (U.S. and non-U.S. plans). The plan for U.S. associates is a tax-qualified plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The non-U.S. plan is not a Section 423 plan. As of January 31, 2010, there were 13 million shares available under the plan for U.S associates and 20 million shares available under the non-U.S. plan. The purchase price of shares under the ESPPs is equal to 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day of the purchase period, which is a six-month period ending on December 31 and June 30 of each year. During fiscal 2009, there were 3 million shares purchased under the ESPPs at an average price of $22.34. Under the outstanding ESPPs as of January 31, 2010, employees have contributed $7 million to purchase shares at 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day (June 30, 2010) of the purchase period. The Company recognized $10 million, $11 million and $14 million of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to the ESPPs. In total, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense, including the expense of stock options, ESPPs, restricted stock, performance shares and deferred shares, of $201 million, $176 million and $207 million, in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

As of January 31, 2010, there was $42 million of unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years.  The following table summarizes restricted stock and performance shares outstanding at January 31, 2010 (shares in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Number of Shares   Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at January 28, 2007  10,130   $ 39.20       Granted  7,091    39.10 Restrictions lapsed  (2,662 )   39.01 Canceled  (2,844 )   39.37       Outstanding at February 3, 2008  11,715   $ 39.14       Granted  7,938    27.14 Restrictions lapsed  (1,251 )   34.37 Canceled  (2,115 )   34.86       Outstanding at February 1, 2009  16,287   $ 34.22       Granted  8,257    23.41 Restrictions lapsed  (1,686 )   34.65 Canceled  (2,195 )   31.84       Outstanding at January 31, 2010  20,663   $ 30.11       ##TABLE_END As of January 31, 2010, there was $332 million of unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and performance shares which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of three years. The total fair value of restricted stock and performance shares vesting during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $41 million, $33 million and $103 million, respectively. ##TABLE_START 8. LEASES ##TABLE_END The Company leases certain retail locations, office space, warehouse and distribution space, equipment and vehicles. While most of the leases are operating leases, certain locations and equipment are leased under capital leases. As leases expire, it can be expected that, in the normal course of business, certain leases will be renewed or replaced. Certain lease agreements include escalating rents over the lease terms. The Company expenses rent on a straight-line basis over the lease term which commences on the date the Company has the right to control the property. The cumulative expense recognized on a straight-line basis in excess of the cumulative payments is included in Other Accrued Expenses and Other Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total rent expense, net of minor sublease income for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $823 million, $846 million and $824 million, respectively. Certain store leases also provide for contingent rent payments based on percentages of sales in excess of specified minimums. Contingent rent expense for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $4 million, $5 million and $6 million, respectively. Real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and operating expenses applicable to the leased property are obligations of the Company under the lease agreements.  The approximate future minimum lease payments under capital and all other leases at January 31, 2010 were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START Fiscal Year  Capital Leases  Operating Leases 2010  $ 90  $ 802 2011   90   717 2012   90   640 2013   89   584 2014   88   535 Thereafter through 2097   795   5,258         1,242  $ 8,536     Less imputed interest   834      Net present value of capital lease obligations   408  Less current installments   19      Long-term capital lease obligations, excluding current installments  $ 389      ##TABLE_END Short-term and long-term obligations for capital leases are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in Current Installments of Long-Term Debt and Long-Term Debt, respectively. The assets under capital leases recorded in Property and Equipment, net of amortization, totaled $299 million and $309 million at January 31, 2010 and February 1, 2009, respectively. ##TABLE_START 9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS ##TABLE_END The Company maintains active defined contribution retirement plans for its employees (the Benefit Plans). All associates satisfying certain service requirements are eligible to participate in the Benefit Plans. The Company makes cash contributions each payroll period up to specified percentages of associates contributions as approved by the Board of Directors. The Company also maintains a restoration plan to provide certain associates deferred compensation that they would have received under the Benefit Plans as a matching contribution if not for the maximum compensation limits under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company funds the restoration plan through contributions made to a grantor trust, which are then used to purchase shares of the Companys common stock in the open market. The Companys contributions to the Benefit Plans and the restoration plan were $161 million, $158 million and $152 million for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. At January 31, 2010, the Benefit Plans and the restoration plan held a total of 18 million shares of the Companys common stock in trust for plan participants. ##TABLE_START 10. BASIC AND DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES ##TABLE_END The reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average common shares for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 is as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended   January 31, 2010  February 1, 2009  February 3, 2008 Weighted average common shares  1,683  1,682  1,849 Effect of potentially dilutive securities:    Stock Plans  9  4  7       Diluted weighted average common shares  1,692  1,686  1,856       ##TABLE_END  Stock plans include shares granted under the Companys employee stock plans as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Options to purchase 48 million, 52 million and 43 million shares of common stock at January 31, 2010, February 1, 2009 and February 3, 2008, respectively, were excluded from the computation of Diluted Earnings per Share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_START 11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ##TABLE_END The fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties. A liabilitys fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: ##TABLE_START  Level 1    Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets  Level 2    Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  Level 3    Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions ##TABLE_END Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 31, 2010 are as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Fair Value at Reporting Date Using   Level 1  Level 2   Level 3 Available-for-sale securities  $ 6  $    $  Derivative agreements - assets      15     Derivative agreements - liabilities      (4 )              Total  $ 6  $ 11   $            ##TABLE_END The Companys available-for-sale securities are discussed further under the caption Short-Term Investments in Note 1. The Companys derivative agreements are discussed further in Note 5. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of January 31, 2010 are as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Fair Value Level 3   Fiscal 2009 Gains (Losses)  HD Supply investment  $    $ (163 ) Store Rationalization - lease obligation costs, net   (191 )   (84 )         Total  $ (191 )  $ (247 )         ##TABLE_END During fiscal 2009, the Company impaired the remaining value of its investment in HD Supply using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3), as further discussed in Note 4. Additionally, lease obligation costs included in the Companys Rationalization Charges were measured on a nonrecurring basis using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3), as further discussed in Note 2. Long-lived assets and goodwill and other intangible assets were also analyzed for impairment on a nonrecurring basis using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3). The Company did not record any impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal 2009 as further discussed in Note 1  under the caption Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Impairment charges related to long-lived assets in fiscal 2009 were not material, as further discussed in Note 1 under the caption Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. The aggregate fair value of the Companys Senior Notes, based on quoted market prices (level 1), was $9.5 billion at January 31, 2010 compared to a carrying value of $9.3 billion. ##TABLE_START 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ##TABLE_END At January 31, 2010, the Company was contingently liable for approximately $434 million under outstanding letters of credit and open accounts issued for certain business transactions, including insurance programs, trade contracts and construction contracts. The Companys letters of credit are primarily performance-based and are not based on changes in variable components, a liability or an equity security of the other party. On January 27, 2010, the Superior Court of the County of Los Angeles in California approved the Companys settlement with the plaintiffs in five lawsuits containing multiple class-action allegations that the Company failed to provide meal breaks. The complaints were filed by current and former hourly associates from the first quarter of 2004 through the fourth quarter of 2008. The disposition of this matter is now complete. As previously disclosed, the Company established a reserve for this settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The settlement did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations. ##TABLE_START 13.

We continued to eliminate tasks to give associates more time with customers and provide enhanced customer service. At the same time, we remained focused on offering every day values in the stores. Finally, we continued our focus on disciplined capital allocation, expense control and increasing shareholder returns. Customers. The Home Depot stores serve three primary customer groups: ##TABLE_START    Do-It-Yourself (D-I-Y) Customers: These customers are typically home owners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Do-It-For-Me (D-I-F-M) Customers: These customers are typically home owners who purchase materials themselves and hire third parties to complete the project or installation.

The following table shows the percentage of Net Sales of each major product group (and related services) for each of the last three fiscal years: ##TABLE_START Product Group  Percentage of Net Sales for Fiscal Year Ended   January 30, 2011   January 31, 2010   February 1, 2009  Plumbing, electrical and kitchen   30.0 %   29.8 %   30.6 % Hardware and seasonal   29.4    29.1    28.7  Building materials, lumber and millwork   21.7    21.9    22.1  Paint and flooring   18.9    19.2    18.6              Total   100.0 %   100.0 %   100.0 %             ##TABLE_END In fiscal 2010, we continued to introduce a number of innovative and distinctive products to our customers at highly attractive values. Examples of these new products include EcoSmart  LED light bulbs, Commercial Electric  electrical tools, Husky  tool bags, Platinum Plus carpeting and Ryobi  outdoor tools. To complement and enhance our product selection, we continued to form strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. During fiscal 2010, we offered a number of proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments including, but not limited to, Behr Premium Plus  paint, Hampton Bay  lighting, Vigoro  lawn care products, Husky  hand tools, RIDGID  and Ryobi  power tools and Glacier Bay  bath fixtures. We also continued our partnership with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia to offer an exclusive Martha Stewart Living brand of home improvement products in select categories including outdoor living, paint, cabinetry, flooring, and shelving and storage. We may consider additional strategic alliances and relationships with other suppliers and will continue to assess opportunities to expand the range of products available under brand names that are exclusive to The Home Depot.  From our Store Support Center, we maintain a global sourcing merchandise program to source high-quality products directly from manufacturers around the world. Our merchant team identifies and purchases market leading innovative products directly for our stores. Additionally, we have three sourcing offices located in the Chinese cities of Shanghai, Shenzhen and Dalian, and offices in Gurgaon, India; Rome, Italy; Monterrey, Mexico and Toronto, Canada. Services. Our stores offer a variety of installation services. These services target D-I-F-M customers who select and purchase products and installation of those products from us. These installation programs include products such as carpeting, flooring, cabinets, countertops and water heaters. In addition, we provide professional installation of a number of products sold through our in-home sales programs, such as generators and furnace and central air systems. Stores. United States . At the end of fiscal 2010, we were operating 1,976 The Home Depot stores in the U.S., including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. During fiscal 2010, we opened two new The Home Depot stores in the U.S., including one relocation, and closed one store. Canada . At the end of fiscal 2010, we were operating 179 The Home Depot stores in ten Canadian provinces. Mexico . At the end of fiscal 2010, we were operating 85 The Home Depot stores in Mexico. Of these stores, six were opened during fiscal 2010. China . At the end of fiscal 2010, we were operating eight The Home Depot stores in four Chinese cities. We closed two stores in China during fiscal 2010. Net Sales for the Company outside of the U.S. were $7.5 billion, $7.0 billion and $7.4 billion for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Long-lived assets outside of the U.S. totaled $3.2 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion as of January 30, 2011, January 31, 2010 and February 1, 2009, respectively. Store Support Services Information Technologies. During fiscal 2010, we continued to invest in our information technology to serve our customers more effectively and provide an improved overall shopping environment and experience. We also continued to invest in our supply chain and merchandising tools to improve inventory management capabilities. With regard to our supply chain and merchandising activities, in fiscal 2010 we completed the roll out of a warehouse management system into our flow distribution network, reduced freight costs by implementing transportation planning systems for both inbound and outbound shipments and continued improving inventory management capabilities by implementing a new inventory forecasting solution. Further, we provided additional tools and made improvements to existing tools utilized in merchandising systems to simplify set-up processes and provide more effective management of our distribution network. To better serve our customers and simplify store tasking, we completed deployment of our FIRST Phones across our stores in fiscal 2010, equipping our associates with devices that are at once portable computers, phones, walkie-talkies and portable registers that allow customers to check out using debit or credit cards. In addition, we are implementing new customer analytics capabilities to better understand customer behavior.  Credit Services. We offer private label credit products in our stores through a third-party credit provider to professional, D-I-Y and D-I-F-M customers. In fiscal 2010, approximately 2.5 million new The Home Depot private label credit accounts were opened, and the total number of The Home Depot active account holders was approximately 10 million. Private label credit card sales accounted for approximately 22% of store sales in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2010, we also launched a home improvement loan program for D-I-F-M customers and introduced PayPal as a payment option for our online customers. Logistics. We continued our supply chain transformation in fiscal 2010 to ensure product availability for customers, effective use of our investment in inventory and optimal total supply chain costs. Across our supply chain operations in the U.S., we continued the restructuring of our distribution center network to meet the changing needs of our business, including our general distribution center space rationalization initiatives and the completion of the Rapid Deployment Center (RDC) roll out in the U.S. RDCs allow for aggregation of store product needs to a single purchase order, and then rapid allocation and deployment of inventory to individual stores upon arrival at the center. This process allows improved transportation, simplified order processing at suppliers and last minute reallocation from the time that product needs at stores are determined to actual replenishment. As a result of the changes to our distribution network, in fiscal 2010 we added 2.9 million net square feet of distribution center space, primarily for new RDCs. At the end of fiscal 2010, we operated 30 bulk distribution centers and 34 conventional distribution centers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Additionally in fiscal 2010, we opened seven new RDCs in the U.S., bringing our total number of RDCs to 19. We now serve all of our U.S. stores from RDCs, with approximately 42% of our costs of sales on an annualized basis for those stores serviced through the RDCs. We remain committed to leveraging our supply chain capabilities to fully utilize and optimize our improved logistics network. Associates. At the end of fiscal 2010, we employed approximately 321,000 associates, of whom approximately 19,000 were salaried, with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis. Approximately 59% of our associates are employed on a full-time basis. We believe that our employee relations are very good. To attract and retain qualified personnel, we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve. Intellectual Property. Our business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, e-commerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business. We also maintain patent portfolios relating to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our products or business operations. Quality Assurance Program. We have both quality assurance and engineering resources that are dedicated to overseeing the quality of all of our products, whether they are directly imported, locally- or globally-sourced or proprietary branded products. Through these programs, we have established criteria for supplier and product performance that are designed to ensure that our products comply with federal, state and local safety, quality and performance standards and to allow us to measure and track the timeliness of shipments. We also have a Supplier Social and Environmental Responsibility Program designed to ensure that our suppliers adhere to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility. Environmental, Health  Safety (EHS). We are committed to maintaining a safe environment for our customers and associates and protecting the environment of the communities in which we do business. Our EHS function in the field is directed by trained associates focused primarily on the execution of the EHS programs. Additionally, we have a Store Support Center-based team of dedicated EHS professionals who evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a Company-wide basis.  Environmental. The Home Depot is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner. This commitment impacts all areas of our business, including store construction and maintenance, energy usage, supply chain, product selection and delivery of product knowledge to our customers. In fiscal 2010, we continued to implement strict operational standards that establish energy efficient practices in all of our facilities. These include HVAC unit temperature regulation and adherence to strict lighting schedules, which are the largest sources of energy consumption in our stores, as well as using energy management systems in each store to monitor energy efficiency. We estimate that by implementing and utilizing these energy saving programs, we have saved over 3.5 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) since 2004, enough to power approximately 320,000 U.S. homes for one year. We have achieved over a 16 percent reduction in kWh per square foot in our U.S. stores since 2004, and our goal is to achieve a 20 percent reduction in our U.S. stores by 2015, through our energy conservation initiatives. We have also partnered with the U.S. Green Building Council and have built seven Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for New Construction (LEED-NC) certified and other similarly certified stores. In fiscal 2010, we began one of the largest retailer host solar programs in North America, installing solar panels on 62 of our North American store locations, capable of producing 21 megawatts. Through our supply chain efficiencies created by the actions described above under Logistics, we are targeting a 20 percent reduction in our domestic supply chain greenhouse gas emissions from 2008 to 2015, which would equate to annual fuel savings of approximately 25 million gallons or approximately 8,000 trips around the earths circumference. We have been recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency SmartWay SM Transport Partnership for our leadership in conserving energy and lowering greenhouse gas emission from our supply chain activities. In fiscal 2010, we also calculated our total carbon dioxide emissions for 2009 to allow us greater insight into our carbon footprint from the operation of our stores as well as from our transportation and supply chain activities. As the worlds largest home improvement retailer, we are in a unique position to enable our customers to achieve energy savings through our products and services. Through our Eco Options  Program introduced in 2007, we have created product categories that allow consumers to easily identify environmentally preferred product selections in our stores. Our Eco Options  Program has certified approximately 4,000 products that meet specifications for energy efficiency, water conservation, healthy home, clean air and sustainable forestry. Through this program, we sell products such as Energy Star  refrigerators, dishwashers, compact fluorescent light bulbs, programmable thermostats, water heaters and other products, enabling our customers to save on their utility bills. We also help our customers save water through sales of WaterSense  -labeled bath faucets, aerators and toilets. Our Eco Options  page on our website offers consumer education on environmental impacts of various products as well as identifying easy green D-I-Y projects. This online experience, coupled with our D-I-Y in-store how-to clinics on green projects and our continual enhancement of our Eco Options  product categories, helps us to meet a growing customer demand for environmentally responsible and cost-saving products and projects. We continue to offer our nationwide, in-store compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulb recycling program launched in June 2008. This service is offered to customers free of charge and is available in all U.S. stores. We also maintain an in-store rechargeable battery recycling program. Launched in 2001 in partnership with the Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation, this program is also available to customers free of charge in all U.S. and Canada stores. Through these recycling programs, in fiscal 2010 we helped recycle over 700,000 pounds of CFL bulbs and over 620,000 pounds of rechargeable batteries collected from our customers. In fiscal 2010, we also recycled over 120,000 lead acid batteries collected from our customers under our lead acid battery exchange program, as well as approximately 160,000 tons of cardboard through a nationwide cardboard recycling program across our U.S. stores. Seasonality. Our business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, and the lowest volume occurs during our fourth fiscal quarter.  Competition. Our business is highly competitive, based primarily on customer service, price, store location and assortment of merchandise. In each of the markets we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. With respect to some products, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and, to a lesser extent, other retailers. Due to the variety of competition we face, we are unable to precisely measure the impact on our sales by our competitors. ##TABLE_START ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. ##TABLE_END The risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. The Risk Factors described below include the considerable risks associated with the current economic environment and the related potential adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. You should read these Risk Factors in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item 8. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. Sustained uncertainty regarding current economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. Our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. Adverse conditions in or sustained uncertainty about these markets or the economy could adversely impact consumer confidence, causing our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services. Other factors  including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures, interest rate fluctuations, fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs, the availability of financing, the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit, weather, natural disasters and other conditions beyond our control  could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. We operate in markets that are highly competitive. We compete principally based on customer service, price, store location and appearance, and quality, availability and assortment of merchandise. In each market we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and other retailers, as well as with installers of home improvement products. Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors could affect prices or demand for our products and services. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through maintenance of superior customer service and customer loyalty, our financial performance and our market share could be adversely affected. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics and  consumer preferences, expectations and needs. Failure to maintain attractive stores and to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences, expectations as to service levels, spending patterns and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs. Our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations or healthcare benefits, and health and other insurance costs. In addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. The inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. Prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. We rely on third party suppliers. If we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our current suppliers experience financial difficulties, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. We buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by political instability, the financial instability of suppliers (particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the world), suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, supply disruptions, shipping interruptions or cost, and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. As part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. If we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation. If we do not maintain the security of customer, associate or company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. Any significant compromise or breach of customer, associate or company data security could significantly damage our reputation and result in additional costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits. The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. There is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches.  A failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to analyze, process and manage transactions and data. We also rely heavily on the integrity of this data in managing our business. We or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be expensive, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. The implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. We have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology. These initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience. The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. In addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether. Disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. A disruption within our logistics or supply chain network, including damage or destruction to our distribution centers, could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to our reputation. Such a disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, increased enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. We are subject to various federal, state or local laws and regulations that govern different aspects of our business. Recently, there have been a large number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms, as well as increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. Changes in, increased enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements, other wage or workplace regulations, the sale of some of our products, transportation, logistics, taxes, energy costs or environmental matters, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our store operations. Healthcare reform under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 enacted in March 2010 could adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates. Our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if needed, could be adversely affected by the volatility in the capital markets. We obtain and manage liquidity from the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to capital markets, including our commercial paper programs supported by a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks. Although we currently maintain a strong investment grade rating and had no outstanding commercial paper obligations as of the end of fiscal 2010, there is no assurance that our ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets, if needed, will not be adversely impacted due to economic conditions. New or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity and volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit, higher cost of borrowing and lack of confidence in the equity market, making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us.  If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations. Our ability to successfully operate in international markets is affected by many of the same operational risks we face in our U.S. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. Our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by our inability to identify and gain access to local suppliers as well as by local laws and customs, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), other legal and regulatory constraints, political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, adverse tax consequences, greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights and risks associated with FCPA and local anti-bribery law compliance. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations. If we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business, we could be subject to fines and lawsuits. We act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our D-I-F-M customers through third-party installers. As such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of our third-party installers. We have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. If we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive verdicts. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of managements attention and resources from other matters. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Additionally, at the end of fiscal 2010, we had six Home Decorators Collection locations in Illinois, Kansas, Missouri and New Jersey. At the end of fiscal 2010, we utilized 185 warehouses and distribution centers located in 34 states or provinces, consisting of approximately 35.6 million square feet, of which approximately 0.2 million is owned and approximately 35.4 million is leased. Our executive, corporate staff, divisional staff and financial offices occupy approximately 2.1 million square feet of leased and owned space in Atlanta, Georgia. At the end of fiscal 2010, we occupied an aggregate of approximately 4.1 million square feet, of which approximately 2.4 million square feet is owned and approximately 1.7 million square feet is leased, for store support centers and customer support centers in Atlanta and other locations.  ##TABLE_START ", "3": " Item 3. Legal Proceedings. ##TABLE_END In July 2005, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office in Los Angeles, California, seeking documents and information relating to the Companys handling, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. The Company is cooperating fully with the United States Attorneys Office. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding, it does not expect the outcome to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. As previously reported, in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2006, three purported, but uncertified, class actions were filed against the Company, The Home Depot FutureBuilder Administrative Committee and certain of the Companys current and former directors and employees alleging breach of fiduciary duty in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) in connection with the Companys return-to-vendor and stock option practices. These actions were joined into one case in 2007, and the joint amended complaint seeks certification as a class action, unspecified damages, costs, attorneys fees and equitable and injunctive relief. On June 7, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in Atlanta granted with prejudice Home Depots motion to dismiss plaintiffs third amended complaint. On June 28, 2010, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of this matter, it does not expect the outcome to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. In September 2010, the Company was contacted by prosecutors in the four counties in California within the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and the City of Los Angeles regarding allegations that the Company sold products in those counties with VOC (volatile organic compound) levels in excess of amounts permitted by SCAQMD rules. The Company has received an administrative subpoena seeking documents and information related to the alleged violations. The Company is in the process of responding to the subpoena. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of this matter, it does not expect the outcome to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. ##TABLE_START Item 4.

Under the Plans, participants may exercise stock options by surrendering shares of common stock that the participants already own as payment of the exercise price. Participants in the Plans may also surrender shares as payment of applicable tax withholding on the vesting of restricted stock and deferred share awards. Shares so surrendered by participants in the Plans are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the Plans and applicable award agreement and not pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) The Companys common stock repurchase program was initially announced on July 15, 2002. As of the end of fiscal 2010, the Board had approved purchases up to $40.0 billion. The program does not have a prescribed expiration date. ##TABLE_END Sales of Unregistered Securities During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company issued 448 deferred stock units under The Home Depot, Inc. NonEmployee Directors Deferred Stock Compensation Plan pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The deferred stock units were credited to the accounts of those nonemployee directors who elected to receive board retainers in the form of deferred stock units instead of cash during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company credited 1,037 deferred stock units to participant accounts under The Home Depot FutureBuilder Restoration Plan pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for involuntary, non-contributory plans. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following the termination of services as described in this plan. ##TABLE_START ", "6": " Item 6. Selected Financial Data. ##TABLE_END The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to page F-1 of this report.  ##TABLE_START ", "7": " Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ##TABLE_END Executive Summary and Selected Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data For fiscal year ended January 30, 2011 (fiscal 2010), we reported Net Earnings of $3.3 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $2.01 compared to Net Earnings of $2.7 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $1.57 for fiscal year ended January 31, 2010 (fiscal 2009). The results for fiscal 2010 included a $51 million pretax charge related to the extension of our guarantee of a senior secured loan of HD Supply, Inc. (the HD Supply Guarantee Extension). The results for fiscal 2009 reflected the impact of several strategic actions initiated in fiscal 2008. These strategic actions resulted in store rationalization charges related to the closing of 15 underperforming U.S. stores and the removal of approximately 50 stores from our new store pipeline, business rationalization charges related to the exit of our EXPO, THD Design Center, Yardbirds and HD Bath businesses (the Exited Businesses) and charges related to the restructuring of support functions (collectively, the Rationalization Charges). These actions resulted in pretax Rationalization Charges of $146 million for fiscal 2009. The results for fiscal 2009 also included a pretax charge of $163 million to write-down our investment in HD Supply, Inc. Additionally, fiscal 2009 included earnings of $41 million from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of HD Supply. We reported Earnings from Continuing Operations of $3.3 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations of $2.01 for fiscal 2010 compared to Earnings from Continuing Operations of $2.6 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations of $1.55 for fiscal 2009. Excluding the HD Supply Guarantee Extension charge from our fiscal 2010 results, and the Rationalization Charges and the write-down of our investment in HD Supply from our fiscal 2009 results, Earnings from Continuing Operations were $3.4 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $2.03 for fiscal 2010 compared to Earnings from Continuing Operations of $2.8 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations of $1.66 for fiscal 2009. Net Sales increased 2.8% to $68.0 billion for fiscal 2010 from $66.2 billion for fiscal 2009. Our comparable store sales increased 2.9% in fiscal 2010, driven by a 2.4% increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 0.5% increase in our comparable store average ticket to $51.93. Comparable store sales for our U.S. stores increased 2.5% in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2010, we focused on the following four key initiatives: Customer Service  Our focus on customer service is anchored on the principles of taking care of our associates, putting customers first and simplifying the business. The roll out of our Customers FIRST training to all store associates and support staff in fiscal 2009 has brought simplification and focus across the business, and we repeated and refreshed the Customers FIRST training during fiscal 2010. The Customers FIRST program is part of our ongoing commitment to improve customer service levels in our stores, and we continued to see the benefit of this training in improved customer service ratings for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Also in fiscal 2010, we completed the deployment of our FIRST Phone, a new hand held device that provides multiple functions such as inventory management, product location and mobile checkout. The core purpose of this new device is to reduce tasking time for our store associates to allow them more time to focus on customer service. We ended fiscal 2010 with more than half of our store payroll allocated to customer facing activities rather than tasking activities. We have a customer facing store payroll target of 60%, and we believe we will achieve that by 2013. Product Authority  Our focus on product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, including innovation, assortment and value. In fiscal 2010, we made significant progress on our merchandising tools in the U.S. that helped us manage markdown and clearance activity and better control inventory. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.13 times at the end of fiscal 2010 compared to 4.06 times at the end of fiscal 2009. Additionally, we continued to form strategic alliances and relationships with selected suppliers to bring a number of proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments.  Productivity and Efficiency  Our approach to driving productivity and efficiency starts with disciplined capital allocation focused on building best-in-class competitive advantages in information technology and supply chain, as well as building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. At the end of fiscal 2010, we completed the roll out of our Rapid Deployment Centers (RDCs) and now have 19 RDCs that serve 100% of our U.S. stores. Also during fiscal 2010, we repurchased 80.9 million shares for $2.6 billion, and on February 22, 2011 we announced a six percent increase in our quarterly cash dividend to 25 cents per share. Interconnected Retail  Our focus on interconnected retail is based on the view that providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels will be a critical enabler for future success. Our multiple channel focus is allowing us to greatly expand our assortment of merchandise, and we are making the investment to build these capabilities, including the roll out of buy on-line, pick-up in store next year. We are committed to having a best-in-class website, and during fiscal 2010 our site was named as a Most Improved Website for customer satisfaction by Foresee, a leading customer satisfaction analytics firm. We opened eight new stores in fiscal 2010, including one relocation, and closed three stores, bringing our total store count at the end of fiscal 2010 to 2,248. As of the end of fiscal 2010, a total of 272 of these stores, or 12.1%, were located in Canada, Mexico and China compared to 268 stores, or 11.9%, at the end of fiscal 2009. We generated approximately $4.6 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2010. We used this cash flow along with cash on hand to fund $2.6 billion of share repurchases, pay $1.6 billion of dividends and fund $1.1 billion in capital expenditures. At the end of fiscal 2010, our long-term debt-to-equity ratio was 46.1% compared to 44.7% at the end of fiscal 2009. Our return on invested capital for continuing operations (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 12.8% for fiscal 2010 compared to 10.7% for fiscal 2009. This increase reflects the impact of the Rationalization Charges which were included in our operating profit for fiscal 2009. Excluding the Rationalization Charges, our return on invested capital for continuing operations was 12.7% for fiscal 2010 compared to 11.1% for fiscal 2009.  We believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations. ##TABLE_START   % of Net Sales   % Increase (Decrease) In Dollar Amounts    Fiscal Year (1)    2010   2009   2008   2010 vs. 2009   2009 vs. 2008  NET SALES   100.0 %   100.0 %   100.0 %   2.8 %   (7.2 )% Gross Profit   34.3    33.9    33.7    4.0    (6.6 ) Operating Expenses:      Selling, General and Administrative   23.3    24.0    25.0    (0.3 )   (10.9 ) Depreciation and Amortization   2.4    2.6    2.5    (5.3 )   (4.4 )                     Total Operating Expenses   25.7    26.6    27.5    (0.8 )   (10.3 )                     OPERATING INCOME   8.6    7.3    6.1    21.6    10.2  Interest and Other (Income) Expense:      Interest and Investment Income               (16.7 )   0.0  Interest Expense   0.8    1.0    0.9    (21.6 )   8.3  Other   0.1    0.2    0.2    (68.7 )   0.0                      Interest and Other, net   0.8    1.2    1.1    (31.1 )   6.8                      EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES   7.8    6.0    5.0    32.4    10.9  Provision for Income Taxes   2.8    2.1    1.8    42.1    6.6                      EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS   4.9 %   4.0 %   3.2 %   27.4 %   13.3 %                     SELECTED SALES DATA      Number of Customer Transactions (in millions)   1,306    1,274    1,272    2.5 %   0.2 % Average Ticket  $ 51.93   $ 51.76   $ 55.61    0.3    (6.9 ) Weighted Average Weekly Sales per Operating Store (in thousands)  $ 581   $ 563   $ 601    3.2    (6.3 ) Weighted Average Sales per Square Foot  $ 288.64   $ 278.97   $ 298.19    3.5    (6.4 ) Comparable Store Sales Increase (Decrease) (%) (2)   2.9 %   (6.6 )%   (8.7 )%   N/A    N/A  ##TABLE_END Note: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding. ##TABLE_START (1) Fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 refer to the fiscal years ended January 30, 2011, January 31, 2010 and February 1, 2009, respectively.

Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Net Sales Net Sales for fiscal 2010 increased 2.8% to $68.0 billion from $66.2 billion for fiscal 2009. The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2010 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales. Total comparable store sales increased 2.9% for fiscal 2010 compared to a decrease of 6.6% for fiscal 2009. The increase in comparable store sales for fiscal 2010 reflects a number of factors. We experienced positive comparable store sales in 11 of our 13 departments for fiscal 2010. Comparable store sales for our Lumber, Tools, Electrical, Indoor Garden, Outdoor Garden and Kitchen/Bath product categories were above the Company average for fiscal 2010. The increase in comparable store sales also reflects a 2.4% increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 0.5% increase in our comparable store average ticket to $51.93. We believe that our sales performance has been, and could continue to be, negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets. We estimate our share of the U.S. home improvement market is approximately 26% using the U.S. Census Bureaus North American Industry Classification System, or NAICS, 4441 classification for building material and supplies dealers. Gross Profit Gross Profit increased 4.0% to $23.3 billion for fiscal 2010 from $22.4 billion for fiscal 2009. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 34.3% for fiscal 2010 compared to 33.9% for fiscal 2009, an increase of 40 basis points. Our U.S. stores experienced gross profit margin expansion in fiscal 2010 as we realized benefits from better product assortment management through our portfolio approach and leveraging of our newly developed merchandising tools. Lower levels of clearance inventory in our stores for fiscal 2010 compared to last year also contributed to this expansion. Additionally, we realized gross profit margin expansion from our non-U.S. businesses, primarily Canada, due primarily to a change in the mix of products sold. Operating Expenses Selling, General and Administrative expenses (SGA) decreased 0.3% to $15.8 billion for fiscal 2010 from $15.9 billion for fiscal 2009. As a percent of Net Sales, SGA was 23.3% for fiscal 2010 compared to 24.0% for fiscal 2009. Excluding the Rationalization Charges, SGA as a percent of Net Sales was 23.9% for fiscal 2009. The decrease in SGA as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2010 reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment and lower payroll and other expenses. Depreciation and Amortization decreased 5.3% to $1.6 billion for fiscal 2010 from $1.7 billion for fiscal 2009. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.4% for fiscal 2010 compared to 2.6% for fiscal 2009. The decrease in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to a smaller depreciable fixed asset base compared to last year, arising from fully depreciated assets. Operating Income Operating Income increased 21.6% to $5.8 billion for fiscal 2010 from $4.8 billion for fiscal 2009. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 8.6% for fiscal 2010 compared to 7.3% for fiscal 2009. Excluding the Rationalization Charges from the results of fiscal 2009, Operating Income increased 18.0% for fiscal 2010.  Interest and Other, net In fiscal 2010, we recognized $566 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $821 million for fiscal 2009. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.8% for fiscal 2010 compared to 1.2% for fiscal 2009. Interest and Other, net, reflects a $51 million charge in fiscal 2010 related to the HD Supply Guarantee Extension and a $163 million charge in fiscal 2009 to write-down our investment in HD Supply. Excluding these charges, Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.8% for fiscal 2010 compared to 1.0% for fiscal 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a $44 million benefit arising from favorable IRS guidance resulting in the reversal of an interest accrual during fiscal 2010, a lower cost of outstanding indebtedness than last year and an interest benefit arising from certain state income tax settlements. Provision for Income Taxes Our combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations increased to 36.7% for fiscal 2010 from 34.2% for fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2009 included benefits arising from a favorable foreign tax settlement and a realignment of our foreign corporate structure. Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $2.01 for fiscal 2010 and $1.55 for fiscal 2009. Excluding the HD Supply Guarantee Extension charge from our fiscal 2010 results, and the Rationalization Charges and the write-down of our investment in HD Supply from our fiscal 2009 results, Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations for fiscal 2010 were $2.03 compared to $1.66 for fiscal 2009, an increase of 22.3%. Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations for fiscal 2010 reflect $0.04 of benefit from repurchases of our common stock. Discontinued Operations On August 30, 2007, the Company closed the sale of HD Supply. Discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 consist of earnings of $41 million, net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of HD Supply. Non-GAAP Measures To provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, we supplement our reporting with non-GAAP financial measures to reflect adjustments for the $51 million pretax charge related to the HD Supply Guarantee Extension as described more fully in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Rationalization Charges as described more fully in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the Net Sales from Exited Businesses during the period from closing announcement to actual closing, and the charges to write-down our investment in HD Supply of $163 million in each of fiscal 2009 and 2008 as described more fully in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency that impact the comparability of underlying business results from period to period. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures.  The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 (amounts in millions, except per share data): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 30, 2011    As Reported   Adjustment   Non-GAAP Measures   % of Net Sales  Net Sales  $ 67,997   $    $ 67,997    100.0 % Cost of Sales   44,693        44,693    65.7                  Gross Profit   23,304        23,304    34.3  Operating Expenses:     Selling, General and Administrative   15,849        15,849    23.3  Depreciation and Amortization   1,616        1,616    2.4                  Total Operating Expenses   17,465        17,465    25.7                  Operating Income   5,839        5,839    8.6  Interest and Other, net   566    51    515    0.8                  Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes   5,273    (51 )   5,324    7.8  Provision for Income Taxes   1,935    (18 )   1,953    2.9                  Earnings from Continuing Operations  $ 3,338   $ (33 )  $ 3,371    5.0 %                 Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations  $ 2.01   $ (0.02 )  $ 2.03    N/A                    Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2010    As Reported   Adjustments   Non-GAAP Measures   % of Net Sales  Net Sales  $ 66,176   $ 221   $ 65,955    100.0 % Cost of Sales   43,764    193    43,571    66.1                  Gross Profit   22,412    28    22,384    33.9  Operating Expenses:     Selling, General and Administrative   15,902    170    15,732    23.9  Depreciation and Amortization   1,707    4    1,703    2.6                  Total Operating Expenses   17,609    174    17,435    26.4                  Operating Income   4,803    (146 )   4,949    7.5  Interest and Other, net   821    163    658    1.0                  Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes   3,982    (309 )   4,291    6.5  Provision for Income Taxes   1,362    (118 )   1,480    2.2                  Earnings from Continuing Operations  $ 2,620   $ (191 )  $ 2,811    4.3 %                 Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations  $ 1.55   $ (0.11 )  $ 1.66    N/A                  ##TABLE_END  Non-GAAP Measures (continued): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2009    As Reported   Adjustments   Non-GAAP Measures   % of Net Sales  Net Sales  $ 71,288   $    $ 71,288    100.0 % Cost of Sales   47,298    30    47,268    66.3                  Gross Profit   23,990    (30 )   24,020    33.7  Operating Expenses:     Selling, General and Administrative   17,846    918    16,928    23.7  Depreciation and Amortization   1,785    3    1,782    2.5                  Total Operating Expenses   19,631    921    18,710    26.2                  Operating Income   4,359    (951 )   5,310    7.4  Interest and Other, net   769    163    606    0.9                  Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes   3,590    (1,114 )   4,704    6.6  Provision for Income Taxes   1,278    (430 )   1,708    2.4                  Earnings from Continuing Operations  $ 2,312   $ (684 )  $ 2,996    4.2 %                 Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations  $ 1.37   $ (0.41 )  $ 1.78    N/A                  ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2009 (fiscal 2008) Net Sales Net Sales for fiscal 2009 decreased 7.2% to $66.2 billion from $71.3 billion for fiscal 2008. The decrease in Net Sales for fiscal 2009 reflects the impact of negative comparable store sales as well as the net impact of fewer open stores in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008. Total comparable store sales decreased 6.6% for fiscal 2009 compared to a decrease of 8.7% for fiscal 2008. There were a number of factors that contributed to our comparable store sales decline. The U.S. residential construction, housing and home improvement markets continued to be soft, and consumers were challenged due to a number of factors including higher unemployment. We saw relative strength in our Building Materials, Flooring, Paint, Plumbing and Garden/Seasonal product categories as comparable store sales in these areas were above the Company average for fiscal 2009. Comparable store sales for our Lumber, Hardware, Electrical, Kitchen/Bath and Millwork product categories were below the Company average for fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, we also saw significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against all currencies. Fluctuating exchange rates negatively impacted our total Company sales by approximately $565 million for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Gross Profit Gross Profit decreased 6.6% to $22.4 billion for fiscal 2009 from $24.0 billion for fiscal 2008. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 33.9% for fiscal 2009 compared to 33.7% for fiscal 2008, an increase of 22 basis points. Through our focused bay portfolio approach, our U.S. merchants continued to introduce new lower prices while growing overall gross margin. Additionally, gross margin expansion for fiscal 2009 was driven by lower markdowns as compared to fiscal 2008. Operating Expenses SGA decreased 10.9% to $15.9 billion for fiscal 2009 from $17.8 billion for fiscal 2008. As a percent of Net Sales, SGA was 24.0% for fiscal 2009 compared to 25.0% for fiscal 2008. Excluding the Rationalization  Charges, SGA as a percent of Net Sales was 23.9% for fiscal 2009 compared to 23.7% for fiscal 2008. Our SGA results for fiscal 2009 reflect the impact of a negative comparable store sales environment, offset by a lower cost of credit associated with the private label credit card program and solid expense control. For fiscal 2009, the penetration of the private label credit card sales was 25.1% compared to 28.1% for fiscal 2008. Depreciation and Amortization decreased 4.4% to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2009 from $1.8 billion for fiscal 2008. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.6% for fiscal 2009 and 2.5% for fiscal 2008. The increase in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to lower sales. Operating Income Operating Income increased 10.2% to $4.8 billion for fiscal 2009 from $4.4 billion for fiscal 2008. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 7.3% for fiscal 2009 compared to 6.1% for fiscal 2008. Excluding the Rationalization Charges, Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 7.5% for fiscal 2009 compared to 7.4% for fiscal 2008. Interest and Other, net In fiscal 2009, we recognized $821 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $769 million in fiscal 2008. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 1.2% for fiscal 2009 compared to 1.1% for fiscal 2008. Interest and Other, net, reflects a $163 million charge in each of fiscal 2009 and 2008 to write-down our investment in HD Supply. Excluding these charges, Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 1.0% for fiscal 2009 compared to 0.9% for fiscal 2008. The increase in Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to lower sales. Provision for Income Taxes Our combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 34.2% for fiscal 2009 from 35.6% for fiscal 2008. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 reflects benefits arising from a favorable foreign tax settlement and a realignment of our foreign corporate structure. Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $1.55 for fiscal 2009 and $1.37 for fiscal 2008. Excluding the Rationalization Charges and the write-downs of our investment in HD Supply, Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations for fiscal 2009 were $1.66 compared to $1.78 for fiscal 2008, a decrease of 6.7%. Discontinued Operations On August 30, 2007, the Company closed the sale of HD Supply. Discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 consist of earnings of $41 million, net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $52 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share in fiscal 2008, in each case for the settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of HD Supply. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. For fiscal 2010, Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was approximately $4.6 billion compared to approximately $5.1 billion for fiscal 2009. This decrease was primarily a result of changes in inventory levels and other net working capital items partially offset by increased earnings. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities for fiscal 2010 was $1.0 billion compared to $755 million for fiscal 2009. This change was primarily due to increased Capital Expenditures and lower Proceeds from Sales of Property and Equipment.  In fiscal 2010, we spent $1.1 billion on Capital Expenditures, allocated as follows: 34% for core technology, 18% for merchandising and operations, 17% for maintenance, 9% for new stores and 22% for other initiatives. In fiscal 2010, we added eight new stores, including one relocation. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities for fiscal 2010 was $4.5 billion compared to $3.5 billion for fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily due to $2.4 billion more in Repurchases of Common Stock than in fiscal 2009, partially offset by a $998 million increase in Proceeds from Long-Term Borrowings and a $745 million decrease in Repayments of Long-Term Debt in fiscal 2010. We repurchased 80.9 million shares of our common stock for $2.6 billion in fiscal 2010 and 7.7 million shares for $213 million in fiscal 2009. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2002, we have repurchased 834.4 million shares of our common stock for a total of $30.1 billion. As of January 30, 2011, $9.9 billion remained under our share repurchase authorization. We have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. In connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. As of January 30, 2011, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility. The credit facility expires in July 2013 and contains various restrictive covenants. As of January 30, 2011, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. We use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers and store support centers. The net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-Term Debt and Current Installments of Long-Term Debt. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of the end of fiscal 2010, our long-term debt-to-equity ratio was 46.1% compared to 44.7% at the end of fiscal 2009. As of January 30, 2011, we guaranteed a $1.0 billion senior secured amortizing term loan in connection with the sale of HD Supply. We are responsible for up to $1.0 billion and any unpaid interest in the event of nonpayment by HD Supply. As reported in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q of HD Supply for the period ended October 31, 2010, the outstanding balance of this term loan as of October 31, 2010 was $940 million. The guaranteed loan is collateralized by certain assets of HD Supply. The original expiration date of the guarantee was August 30, 2012. On March 19, 2010, we amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to April 1, 2014. The fair value of the guarantee at August 30, 2007 was $16 million and was recorded as a liability in Other Long-Term Liabilities. The extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to $67 million, resulting in a $51 million charge to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2010. As of January 30, 2011, we had $545 million in Cash and Cash Equivalents. We believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2010, we repaid $1.0 billion of 5.20% Senior Notes that were due March 1, 2011. We issued commercial paper to repay the 5.20% Senior Notes and plan to refinance this debt in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. At January 30, 2011, we had outstanding interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, that expire on December 16, 2013 with a notional amount of $1.25 billion that swap fixed rate interest on our $1.25 billion 5.25% Senior Notes for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 259 basis points. At January 30, 2011, the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of $47 million, which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreements. In May 2010, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $500 million, accounted for as cash flow hedge, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of issuing long-term debt to refinance debt maturing in fiscal 2011. At January 30, 2011, the approximate fair market value of this  agreement was a liability of $2 million, which is the estimated amount we would have paid to settle the agreement. In September 2010, we issued $500 million of 3.95% Senior Notes due September 15, 2020 at a discount of $1 million and $500 million of 5.40% Senior Notes due September 15, 2040 at a discount of $1 million (together, the September 2010 issuance). The net proceeds of the September 2010 issuance were used to refinance our 4.625% Senior Notes that matured August 15, 2010 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. In fiscal 2009 and 2010, we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of $1.0 billion to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the September 2010 issuance, which were accounted for as cash flow hedges. Upon the September 2010 issuance, we paid $193 million to settle these forward starting interest rate swap agreements. This amount, net of income taxes, is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and is being amortized to Interest Expense over the lives of the Senior Notes issued in September 2010. In March 2011, we entered into an interest rate swap, accounted for as a fair value hedge, that expires on March 1, 2016 with a notional amount of $500 million that swaps fixed rate interest on our $500 million 5.40% Senior Notes due March 1, 2016 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 300 basis points. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of January 30, 2011 (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Payments Due by Fiscal Year  Contractual Obligations  Total   2011   2012-2013   2014-2015   Thereafter  Total Debt (1)  $ 15,953   $ 1,452   $ 2,135   $ 780   $ 11,586  Capital Lease Obligations (2)   1,259    114    192    179    774  Operating Leases   8,181    783    1,338    1,125    4,935  Purchase Obligations (3)   4,352    1,711    1,741    900      Unrecognized Tax Benefits (4)   63    63                                  Total  $ 29,808   $ 4,123   $ 5,406   $ 2,984   $ 17,295                      ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Excludes present value of capital lease obligations of $452 million.

Purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4) Excludes $599 million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. ##TABLE_END Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. Interest rate swap agreements are used, at times, to manage our fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. At January 30, 2011, after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, approximately 87% of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate debt and 13% was floating-rate debt. A 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our results of operations.  As of January 30, 2011 we had, net of discounts, $9.3 billion of Senior Notes outstanding. The aggregate market value of the publicly traded Senior Notes as of January 30, 2011 was approximately $9.8 billion. Although we have international operating entities, our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition or results of operations. Impact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices We have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates. Revenues We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. We have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. However, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely impacted. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. We also record Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. Merchandise Inventories Our Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, with approximately 80% valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method. Retailers like us, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, Merchandise Inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. We evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the end of fiscal 2010 or 2009. Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, swell) is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. We estimate shrink as a percent of Net Sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. The estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008.  Self-Insurance We are self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, workers compensation, medical, product liability and automobile claims. Our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates, and is reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation, or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008. Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. We believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors. Volume rebates and advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in SGA. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, managements decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, we also recognize in SGA the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of long-lived assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition and inflation. A 10% decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations. Our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations. As part of our Rationalization Charges, we recorded no asset impairments in fiscal 2010 and 2009 and recorded $580 million of asset impairments in fiscal 2008. Also as part of our Rationalization Charges, we recorded no lease obligation costs in fiscal 2010 and recorded $84 million and $252 million of lease obligation costs in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the  Rationalization Charges. A 10% decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10% increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations. We also recorded impairments and other lease obligation costs on other closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill, but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. The fair values of our identified reporting units were estimated using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows. We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition, inflation and discount rates. A 10% decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting units tested would result in an impairment that is not material to our results of operations. A 1.0 percentage point increase in the discount rate used would also result in an impairment that is not material to our results of operations. We amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 20 years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. Impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets were not material for fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB issued Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FASB ASC 810-10), which clarifies that the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an entitys purpose and design and a companys ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. FASB ASC 810-10 requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and eliminates the qualifying special purpose entity concept. FASB ASC 810-10 also requires additional disclosures about a companys involvement in variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement. This guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. This guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued guidance to clarify that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and are to be included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. This guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. This guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " Item 7A.

These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and properly reflect certain estimates and judgments based upon the best available information. The financial statements of the Company have been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their accompanying report is based upon an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting solely of independent directors, meets five times a year with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and representatives of management to discuss auditing and financial reporting matters. In addition, a telephonic meeting is held prior to each quarterly earnings release. The Audit Committee retains the independent registered public accounting firm and regularly reviews the internal accounting controls, the activities of the independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors and the financial condition of the Company. Both the Companys independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2011 based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 30, 2011 in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2011 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included on page 30 in this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START /s/ F RANCIS S.

Tom Chief Financial Officer  Executive Vice President  Corporate Services ##TABLE_END  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders The Home Depot, Inc.: We have audited The Home Depot Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Home Depot Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, The Home Depot, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010, and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Stockholders Equity and Comprehensive Income, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 30, 2011, and our report dated March 24, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/ KPMG LLP Atlanta, Georgia March 24, 2011  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders The Home Depot, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010, and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Stockholders Equity and Comprehensive Income, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 30, 2011. These Consolidated Financial Statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Consolidated Financial Statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 30, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ##TABLE_START 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ##TABLE_END Business, Consolidation and Presentation The Home Depot, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) operate The Home Depot stores, which are full-service, warehouse-style stores averaging approximately 105,000 square feet in size. The stores stock approximately 30,000 to 40,000 different kinds of building materials, home improvement supplies and lawn and garden products that are sold to do-it-yourself customers, do-it-for-me customers and professional customers. At the end of fiscal 2010, the Company was operating 2,248 stores, which included 1,976 The Home Depot stores in the United States, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam (U.S.), 179 The Home Depot stores in Canada, 85 The Home Depot stores in Mexico and 8 The Home Depot stores in China. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31. Fiscal years ended January 30, 2011 (fiscal 2010), January 31, 2010 (fiscal 2009) and February 1, 2009 (fiscal 2008) include 52 weeks. Use of Estimates Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses in preparing these financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Receivables and Accounts Payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments. The fair value of the Companys investments is discussed under the caption Short-Term Investments in this Note 1. The fair value of the Companys Long-Term Debt is discussed in Note 11. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Companys cash equivalents are carried at fair market value and consist primarily of high-grade commercial paper, money market funds and U.S. government agency securities. Short-Term Investments Short-term investments are recorded at fair value based on current market rates and are classified as available-for-sale. The Companys short-term investments are included in Other Current Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounts Receivable The Company has an agreement with a third-party service provider who directly extends credit to customers, manages the Companys private label credit card program and owns the related receivables. The Company evaluated the third-party entities holding the receivables under the program and concluded that they should not be consolidated by the Company. The agreement with the third-party service provider expires in 2018, with the Company having the option, but no obligation, to purchase the receivables at the end of the agreement. The deferred interest charges incurred by the Company for its deferred financing programs offered to its customers  are included in Cost of Sales. The interchange fees charged to the Company for the customers use of the cards and the profit sharing with the third-party administrator are included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses (SGA). The sum of the three is referred to by the Company as the cost of credit of the private label credit card program. In addition, certain subsidiaries of the Company extend credit directly to customers in the ordinary course of business. The receivables due from customers were $42 million and $38 million as of January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010, respectively. The Companys valuation reserve related to accounts receivable was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of the end of fiscal 2010 or 2009. Merchandise Inventories The majority of the Companys Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, as determined by the retail inventory method. As the inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, the inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Certain subsidiaries, including retail operations in Canada, Mexico and China, and distribution centers, record Merchandise Inventories at the lower of cost or market, as determined by a cost method. These Merchandise Inventories represent approximately 20% of the total Merchandise Inventories balance. The Company evaluates the inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of the end of fiscal 2010 or 2009. Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in stores, the Company accrues for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis based on historical shrink results and current trends in the business. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, swell) is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. The Company provides for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as for those deferred due to timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Non-U.S. subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, are not eligible to be included in the Companys consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Separate provisions for income taxes have been determined for these entities. The Company intends to reinvest substantially all of the unremitted earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries and postpone their remittance indefinitely. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes for these non-U.S. subsidiaries was recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  Depreciation and Amortization The Companys Buildings, Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold Improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the original term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. The Companys Property and Equipment is depreciated using the following estimated useful lives: ##TABLE_START   Life  Buildings   5  45 years  Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment   2  20 years  Leasehold Improvements   5  45 years  ##TABLE_END Capitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to six years. These costs are included in Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred. Revenues The Company recognizes revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. The liability for sales returns is estimated based on historical return levels. When the Company receives payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. The Company also records Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognizes this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. Gift card breakage income is recognized based upon historical redemption patterns and represents the balance of gift cards for which the Company believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote. During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized $46 million, $40 million and $37 million, respectively, of gift card breakage income. This income is included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a reduction in SGA. Services Revenue Net Sales include services revenue generated through a variety of installation, home maintenance and professional service programs. In these programs, the customer selects and purchases material for a project and the Company provides or arranges professional installation. These programs are offered through the Companys stores. Under certain programs, when the Company provides or arranges the installation of a project and the subcontractor provides material as part of the installation, both the material and labor are included in services revenue. The Company recognizes this revenue when the service for the customer is complete. All payments received prior to the completion of services are recorded in Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Services revenue was $2.7 billion, $2.6 billion and $3.1 billion for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Self-Insurance The Company is self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, workers compensation, medical, product liability and automobile claims. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date is not discounted and is recognized as a liability. The expected ultimate cost of claims is estimated based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates.  Prepaid Advertising Television and radio advertising production costs, along with media placement costs, are expensed when the advertisement first appears. Amounts included in Other Current Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to prepayments of production costs for print and broadcast advertising as well as sponsorship promotions were not material at the end of fiscal 2010 and 2009. Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and certain advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense. In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, gross advertising expense was $864 million, $897 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, and is included in SGA. Specific, incremental and identifiable advertising co-op allowances were $90 million, $105 million and $107 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are recorded as an offset to advertising expense in SGA. Cost of Sales Cost of Sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed, the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to the Companys stores, locations or customers, the operating cost of the Companys sourcing and distribution network and the cost of deferred interest programs offered through the Companys private label credit card program. The cost of handling and shipping merchandise from the Companys stores, locations or distribution centers to the customer is classified as SGA. The cost of shipping and handling, including internal costs and payments to third parties, classified as SGA was $438 million, $426 million and $501 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates its long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, managements decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, the Company also recognizes in SGA the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. As part of its Rationalization Charges, the Company recorded no asset impairments in fiscal 2010 and 2009 and recorded $580 million of asset impairments in fiscal 2008. Also as part of its Rationalization Charges, the Company recorded no lease obligation costs in fiscal 2010 and recorded $84 million and $252 million of lease  obligation costs in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 2 for more details on the Rationalization Charges. The Company also recorded impairments and other lease obligation costs on other closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. The Company does not amortize goodwill, but does assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. The fair values of the Companys identified reporting units were estimated using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows. The Company amortizes the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 20 years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. Impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets were not material for fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008. Stock-Based Compensation The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $6.70, $6.61 and $6.46, respectively. The fair value of these options was determined at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended    January 30, 2011   January 31, 2010   February 1, 2009  Risk-free interest rate   3.1%    2.3%    2.9%  Assumed volatility   26.4%    41.5%    33.8%  Assumed dividend yield   2.9%    3.9%    3.5%  Assumed lives of option   5 years    6 years    6 years  ##TABLE_END Derivatives The Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate exposure on long-term debt and its exposure on foreign currency fluctuations. The Company accounts for its derivative financial instruments in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC) 815-10. The fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments is discussed in Note 11. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive Income includes Net Earnings adjusted for certain revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are excluded from Net Earnings under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Adjustments to Net Earnings and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income consist primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses are generally translated using average exchange rates for the period and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the day of the transaction.  Segment Information The Company operates within a single reportable segment primarily within North America. Net Sales for the Company outside of the U.S. were $7.5 billion, $7.0 billion and $7.4 billion for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Long-lived assets outside of the U.S. totaled $3.2 billion and $3.0 billion as of January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010, respectively. Reclassifications Certain amounts in prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform with the presentation adopted in the current fiscal year. ##TABLE_START 2. RATIONALIZATION CHARGES ##TABLE_END In fiscal 2008, the Company reduced its square footage growth plans to improve free cash flow, provide stronger returns for the Company and invest in its existing stores to continue improving the customer experience. As a result of this store rationalization plan, the Company determined that it would no longer pursue the opening of approximately 50 U.S. stores that had been in its new store pipeline. The Company expects to dispose of or sublet any remaining pipeline locations over varying periods. The Company also closed 15 underperforming U.S. stores in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, and the Company expects to dispose of or sublet any remaining locations over varying periods. Also in fiscal 2008, the Company announced that it would exit its EXPO, THD Design Center, Yardbirds and HD Bath businesses (the Exited Businesses) in order to focus on its core The Home Depot stores. The Company closed the Exited Businesses in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and expects to dispose of or sublet any remaining locations over varying periods. These steps impacted approximately 5,000 associates in those locations, their support functions and their distribution centers. Finally, in January 2009 the Company also restructured its support functions to better align the Companys cost structure. These actions impacted approximately 2,000 associates. The Company did not incur any material charges related to these actions (collectively, the Rationalization Charges) in fiscal 2010 and recognized $146 million and $951 million in total pretax charges for fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company does not expect any further material charges related to these actions. Activity related to Rationalization Charges for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Asset Impairments   Lease Obligation Costs, net   Severance   Other   Total  Fiscal 2008 Charges  $ 580   $ 252   $ 78   $ 41   $ 951  Cash Uses       39    6    18    63  Non-cash Activity   542            3    545                      Accrued Balance at February 1, 2009   38    213    72    20    343                      Fiscal 2009 Charges       84    8    54    146  Cash Uses       106    80    71    257  Non-cash Activity   15            3    18                      Accrued Balance at January 31, 2010   23    191            214                      Cash Uses       42            42  Non-cash Activity   19    (9 )           10                      Accrued Balance at January 30, 2011  $ 4   $ 158   $    $    $ 162                      ##TABLE_END  Inventory markdown costs reflected in Other are included in Cost of Sales in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings, and costs related to asset impairments, lease obligations, severance and other miscellaneous costs are included in SGA expenses. Asset impairment charges, including contractual costs to complete certain assets, were determined based on fair market value using market data for each individual property. Lease obligation costs represent the present value of contractually obligated rental payments offset by estimated sublet income, including estimates of the time required to sublease the locations. The payments related to the leased locations therefore are not generally incremental uses of cash. ##TABLE_START 3. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE ##TABLE_END During fiscal 2008, the Company implemented a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, including a new inventory system, for its retail operations in Canada. Along with this implementation, the Company changed its method of accounting for Merchandise Inventories for its retail operations in Canada from the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, as determined by the retail inventory method, to the lower of cost or market using a weighted-average cost method. As of the end of fiscal 2008, the implementation of the new inventory system and related conversion to the weighted-average cost method for Canadian retail operations was complete. The new ERP system allows the Company to utilize the weighted-average cost method, which the Company believes will result in greater precision in the costing of inventories and a better matching of cost of sales with revenue generated. The effect of the change on the Merchandise Inventories and Retained Earnings balances was not material. Prior to the inventory system conversion, the Company could not determine the impact of the change to the weighted-average cost method, and therefore, could not retroactively apply the change to periods prior to fiscal 2008. ##TABLE_START 4. HD SUPPLY DISPOSITION ##TABLE_END On August 30, 2007, the Company closed the sale of HD Supply, Inc. In accordance with FASB ASC 360-10, the Company reclassified the results of HD Supply as discontinued operations in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. Settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of HD Supply resulted in earnings from discontinued operations of $41 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2009 and a loss from discontinued operations of $52 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2008. In connection with the sale, the Company purchased a 12.5% equity interest in the newly formed HD Supply for $325 million. In fiscal 2008, the Company determined its 12.5% equity interest in HD Supply was impaired and recorded a $163 million charge to write-down the investment. In fiscal 2009, the Company determined its equity interest in HD Supply was further impaired and recorded an additional charge of $163 million to write-down the remaining investment. These charges are included in Interest and Other, net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Also in connection with the sale, the Company guaranteed a $1.0 billion senior secured amortizing term loan of HD Supply. The Company is responsible for up to $1.0 billion and any unpaid interest in the event of nonpayment by HD Supply. As reported in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q of HD Supply for the period ended October 31, 2010, the outstanding balance of this term loan as of October 31, 2010 was $940 million. The guaranteed loan is collateralized by certain assets of HD Supply. The original expiration date of the guarantee was August 30, 2012. On March 19, 2010, the Company amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to April 1, 2014. The fair value of the guarantee at August 30, 2007 was $16 million and was recorded as a liability of the Company in Other Long-Term Liabilities. The extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to $67 million, resulting in a $51 million charge to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2010.  ##TABLE_START 5. DEBT ##TABLE_END The Company has commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. All of the Companys short-term borrowings in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were under these commercial paper programs. In connection with the commercial paper programs, the Company has a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. The credit facility expires in July 2013 and contains various restrictive covenants. At January 30, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact the Companys liquidity or capital resources. Short-Term Debt under the commercial paper programs was as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   January 30, 2011   January 31, 2010  Balance outstanding at fiscal year-end  $    $   Maximum amount outstanding at any month-end  $    $ 190  Average daily short-term borrowings  $ 5   $ 55  Weighted average interest rate   0.4 %   1.1 % ##TABLE_END The Companys Long-Term Debt at the end of fiscal 2010 and 2009 consisted of the following (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   January 30, 2011   January 31, 2010  4.625% Senior Notes; due August 15, 2010; interest payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15  $    $ 999  5.20% Senior Notes; due March 1, 2011; interest payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1   1,000    1,000  5.25% Senior Notes; due December 16, 2013; interest payable semi-annually on June 16 and December 16   1,297    1,258  5.40% Senior Notes; due March 1, 2016; interest payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1   3,033    3,040  3.95% Senior Notes; due September 15, 2020; interest payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15   499      5.875% Senior Notes; due December 16, 2036; interest payable semi-annually on June 16 and December 16   2,960    2,960  5.40% Senior Notes; due September 15, 2040; interest payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15   499      Capital Lease Obligations; payable in varying installments through January 31, 2055   452    408  Other   9    17          Total debt   9,749    9,682  Less current installments   1,042    1,020          Long-Term Debt, excluding current installments  $ 8,707   $ 8,662          ##TABLE_END At January 30, 2011, the Company had outstanding interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, that expire on December 16, 2013 with a notional amount of $1.25 billion that swap fixed rate interest on the Companys $1.25 billion 5.25% Senior Notes for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 259 basis points. At January 30, 2011, the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of $47 million, which is the estimated amount the Company would have received to settle the agreements and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. In May 2010, the Company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $500 million, accounted for as a cash flow hedge, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of issuing long-  term debt to refinance debt maturing in fiscal 2011. At January 30, 2011, the approximate fair market value of this agreement was a liability of $2 million, which is the estimated amount the Company would have paid to settle the agreement and is included in Other Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. In September 2010, the Company issued $500 million of 3.95% Senior Notes due September 15, 2020 at a discount of $1 million and $500 million of 5.40% Senior Notes due September 15, 2040 at a discount of $1 million (together, the September 2010 issuance). Interest on these Senior Notes is due semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The net proceeds of the September 2010 issuance were used to refinance the Companys 4.625% Senior Notes that matured August 15, 2010 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. The $2 million discount associated with the September 2010 issuance is being amortized over the term of the Senior Notes using the effective interest rate method. Issuance costs were $8 million and are being amortized over the term of the Senior Notes. In fiscal 2009 and 2010, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of $1.0 billion to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the September 2010 issuance, which were accounted for as cash flow hedges. Upon the September 2010 issuance, the Company paid $193 million to settle these forward starting interest rate swap agreements. This amount, net of income taxes, is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and is being amortized to Interest Expense over the lives of the Senior Notes issued in September 2010. During fiscal 2007 and 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, with notional amounts of $3.0 billion, that swapped fixed rate interest on the Companys $3.0 billion 5.40% Senior Notes due March 1, 2016 for variable rate interest equal to LIBOR plus 60 to 149 basis points. In fiscal 2008, the Company received $56 million to settle these swaps, which is being amortized to reduce net Interest Expense over the remaining term of the debt. The Senior Notes may be redeemed by the Company at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed, or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, if a Change in Control Triggering Event occurs, as defined by the terms of the September 2010 Issuance and the 5.25% Senior Notes and the 5.875% Senior Notes issuance (together, the December 2006 Issuance), holders of the September 2010 Issuance and the December 2006 Issuance have the right to require the Company to redeem those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The Company is generally not limited under the indenture governing the Senior Notes in its ability to incur additional indebtedness or required to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. Further, while the indenture governing the Senior Notes contains various restrictive covenants, none is expected to impact the Companys liquidity or capital resources. At January 30, 2011, the Company had outstanding cross currency swap agreements with a notional amount of $590 million, accounted for as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency fluctuations on certain intercompany debt. At January 30, 2011, the approximate fair value of these agreements was a liability of $38 million, which is the estimated amount the Company would have paid to settle the agreements and is included in Other Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings is net of interest capitalized of $3 million, $4 million and $20 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Maturities of Long-Term Debt are $1.0 billion for fiscal 2011, $29 million for fiscal 2012, $1.3 billion for fiscal 2013, $28 million for fiscal 2014, $26 million for fiscal 2015 and $7.3 billion thereafter.  ##TABLE_START 6.

At January 30, 2011, the Company had state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, expiring at various dates from 2011 to 2028. Management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits related to the net operating losses will be realized. However, certain foreign net operating losses are in jurisdictions where the expiration period is too short to be assured of utilization. Therefore, a valuation allowance has been provided to reduce the deferred tax asset related to net operating losses to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Total valuation allowances related to net operating losses at January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010 were $21 million and $15 million, respectively. As a result of its sale of HD Supply, the Company incurred a tax loss, resulting in a net capital loss carryover of approximately $397 million as of January 30, 2011. Portions of the net capital loss carryover will expire in fiscal years 2013 through 2015 if not used. The Company has concluded that it is not more likely than not that all of the tax benefits related to the capital loss carryover will be realized based on its ability to generate adequate capital gain income during the carryover period. Therefore, a valuation allowance of $45 million has been provided. The Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $30 million and $65 million as of January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010, respectively. The foreign tax credit carryforwards will expire in 2020. Management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits related to the foreign tax credit carryforwards will be realized based on the Companys ability to generate foreign source income during the carryforward period. Therefore, no valuation allowance has been provided. The Company has not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes on approximately $2.0 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries because of its intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable; however, unrecognized foreign income tax credits would be available to reduce a portion of this liability. The Companys income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. The Companys U.S. federal and Canadian tax returns for fiscal years 2005 through 2007 are currently under audit by the IRS and the Canadian tax authorities. There are also ongoing U.S. state and local and other foreign audits covering tax years 2003 to 2009. The Company does not expect the results from any income tax audit to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. The Company believes that certain adjustments under examination by the IRS and in certain states will be agreed upon within the next twelve months. The Company has classified approximately $63 million of the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits as a short-term liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Final settlement of these audit issues may result in payments that are more or less than these amounts, but the Company does not anticipate the resolution of these matters will result in a material change to its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Reconciliations of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for continuing operations for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   January 30, 2011   January 31, 2010   February 1, 2009  Unrecognized tax benefits balance at beginning of fiscal year  $ 659   $ 695   $ 608  Additions based on tax positions related to the current year   174    55    67  Additions for tax positions of prior years   84    33    231  Reductions for tax positions of prior years   (181 )   (28 )   (142 ) Reductions due to settlements   (65 )   (94 )   (65 ) Reductions due to lapse of statute of limitations   (9 )   (2 )   (4 )             Unrecognized tax benefits balance at end of fiscal year  $ 662   $ 659   $ 695              ##TABLE_END  The amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $298 million, $386 million and $401 million as of January 30, 2011, January 31, 2010 and February 1, 2009, respectively, that if recognized would affect the annual effective income tax rate. Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions provided income of $32 million in fiscal 2010, expense of $41 million in fiscal 2009 and income of $19 million in fiscal 2008. Total accrued interest and penalties as of January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010 are $84 million and $138 million, respectively. Interest and penalties are included in Interest Expense and SGA, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. ##TABLE_START 7. EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS ##TABLE_END The Home Depot, Inc. 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (2005 Plan) and The Home Depot, Inc. 1997 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (1997 Plan and collectively with the 2005 Plan, the Plans) provide that incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, performance shares, performance units and deferred shares may be issued to selected associates, officers and directors of the Company. Under the 2005 Plan, the maximum number of shares of the Companys common stock authorized for issuance is 255 million shares, with any award other than a stock option reducing the number of shares available for issuance by 2.11 shares. As of January 30, 2011, there were 175 million shares available for future grants under the 2005 Plan. No additional equity awards could be issued from the 1997 Plan after the adoption of the 2005 Plan on May 26, 2005. Under the terms of the Plans, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options must have an exercise price at or above the fair market value of the Companys stock on the date of the grant. Typically, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options vest at the rate of 25% per year commencing on the first or second anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth anniversary date of the grant. Certain of the non-qualified stock options also include performance options which vest on the later of the first anniversary date of the grant and the date the closing price of the Companys common stock has been 25% greater than the exercise price of the options for 30 consecutive trading days. Additionally, certain stock options may become non-forfeitable upon age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The Company recognized $20 million, $19 million and $47 million of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to stock options. Restrictions on the restricted stock issued under the Plans generally lapse according to one of the following schedules: (1) the restrictions on the restricted stock lapse over various periods up to five years, (2) the restrictions on 25% of the restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing upon the associates attainment of age 62, or (3) the restrictions on 25% of the restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing upon the earlier of the associates attainment of age 60 or the tenth anniversary date. The Company has also granted performance shares under the Plans, the payout of which is dependent on either (1) the Companys total shareholder return percentile ranking compared to the performance of individual companies included in the SP 500 index at the end of the three-year performance cycle, or (2) the Companys performance against target average return on invested capital and operating profit over a three-year performance cycle. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon the attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The fair value of the restricted stock and performance shares is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and performance shares of $167 million, $158 million and $109 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, there were an aggregate of 479 thousand, 666 thousand and 641 thousand deferred shares, respectively, granted under the Plans. For associates, each deferred share entitles the individual to one share of common stock to be received up to five years after the grant date of the deferred shares, subject to certain deferral rights of the associate. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon age 60,  provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to deferred shares of $14 million, $14 million and $9 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of January 30, 2011, there were 2 million non-qualified stock options outstanding under non-qualified stock option plans that are not part of the Plans. The Company maintains two Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) (U.S. and non-U.S. plans). The plan for U.S. associates is a tax-qualified plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The non-U.S. plan is not a Section 423 plan. As of January 30, 2011, there were 11 million shares available under the plan for U.S associates and 20 million shares available under the non-U.S. plan. The purchase price of shares under the ESPPs is equal to 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day of the purchase period, which is a six-month period ending on December 31 and June 30 of each year. During fiscal 2010, there were 3 million shares purchased under the ESPPs at an average price of $26.50. Under the outstanding ESPPs as of January 30, 2011, employees have contributed $7 million to purchase shares at 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day (June 30, 2011) of the purchase period. The Company recognized $13 million, $10 million and $11 million of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to the ESPPs. In total, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense, including the expense of stock options, ESPPs, restricted stock, performance shares and deferred shares, of $214 million, $201 million and $176 million, in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The following table summarizes stock options outstanding at January 30, 2011, January 31, 2010 and February 1, 2009, and changes during the fiscal years ended on these dates (shares in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Number of Shares   Weighted Average Exercise Price  Outstanding at February 3, 2008   52,365   $ 38.98          Granted   5,226    26.09  Exercised   (777 )   22.55  Canceled   (4,800 )   39.14          Outstanding at February 1, 2009   52,014   $ 37.91          Granted   4,174    23.29  Exercised   (374 )   24.50  Canceled   (6,505 )   37.65          Outstanding at January 31, 2010   49,309   $ 36.81          Granted   3,723    32.24  Exercised   (1,294 )   26.63  Canceled   (7,271 )   43.95          Outstanding at January 30, 2011   44,467   $ 35.56          ##TABLE_END The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $9 million, $1 million and $4 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of January 30, 2011, there were approximately 44 million stock options outstanding with a weighted average remaining life of four years and an intrinsic value of $51 million. As of January 30, 2011, there were approximately 33 million stock options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $38.21, a weighted average remaining life of two years, and an intrinsic value of $49 million. As of January 30, 2011, there were approximately 41 million stock options vested or expected to ultimately vest. As of January 30, 2011, there was $45 million of unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years.  The following table summarizes restricted stock and performance shares outstanding at January 30, 2011 (shares in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Number of Shares   Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value  Outstanding at February 3, 2008   11,715   $ 39.14          Granted   7,938    27.14  Restrictions lapsed   (1,251 )   34.37  Canceled   (2,115 )   34.86          Outstanding at February 1, 2009   16,287   $ 34.22          Granted   8,257    23.41  Restrictions lapsed   (1,686 )   34.65  Canceled   (2,195 )   31.84          Outstanding at January 31, 2010   20,663   $ 30.11          Granted   5,799    32.31  Restrictions lapsed   (5,276 )   32.28  Canceled   (1,747 )   30.11          Outstanding at January 30, 2011   19,439   $ 30.18          ##TABLE_END As of January 30, 2011, there was $259 million of unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and performance shares, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years. The total fair value of restricted stock and performance shares vesting during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $168 million, $41 million and $33 million, respectively. ##TABLE_START 8. LEASES ##TABLE_END The Company leases certain retail locations, office space, warehouse and distribution space, equipment and vehicles. While most of the leases are operating leases, certain locations and equipment are leased under capital leases. As leases expire, it can be expected that, in the normal course of business, certain leases will be renewed or replaced. Certain lease agreements include escalating rents over the lease terms. The Company expenses rent on a straight-line basis over the lease term which commences on the date the Company has the right to control the property. The cumulative expense recognized on a straight-line basis in excess of the cumulative payments is included in Other Accrued Expenses and Other Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total rent expense, net of minor sublease income for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $821 million, $823 million and $846 million, respectively. Certain store leases also provide for contingent rent payments based on percentages of sales in excess of specified minimums. Contingent rent expense for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $3 million, $4 million and $5 million, respectively. Real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and operating expenses applicable to the leased property are obligations of the Company under the lease agreements.  The approximate future minimum lease payments under capital and all other leases at January 30, 2011 were as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START Fiscal Year  Capital Leases   Operating Leases  2011  $ 114   $ 783  2012   96    699  2013   96    639  2014   92    582  2015   87    543  Thereafter through 2097   774    4,935            1,259   $ 8,181       Less imputed interest   807        Net present value of capital lease obligations   452   Less current installments   41        Long-term capital lease obligations, excluding current installments  $ 411        ##TABLE_END Short-term and long-term obligations for capital leases are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in Current Installments of Long-Term Debt and Long-Term Debt, respectively. The assets under capital leases recorded in Property and Equipment, net of amortization, totaled $336 million and $299 million at January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010, respectively. ##TABLE_START 9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS ##TABLE_END The Company maintains active defined contribution retirement plans for its employees (the Benefit Plans). All associates satisfying certain service requirements are eligible to participate in the Benefit Plans. The Company makes cash contributions each payroll period up to specified percentages of associates contributions as approved by the Board of Directors. The Company also maintains a restoration plan to provide certain associates deferred compensation that they would have received under the Benefit Plans as a matching contribution if not for the maximum compensation limits under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company funds the restoration plan through contributions made to a grantor trust, which are then used to purchase shares of the Companys common stock in the open market. The Companys contributions to the Benefit Plans and the restoration plan were $171 million, $161 million and $158 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At January 30, 2011, the Benefit Plans and the restoration plan held a total of 16 million shares of the Companys common stock in trust for plan participants. ##TABLE_START 10. BASIC AND DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES ##TABLE_END The reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average common shares for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended    January 30, 2011   January 31, 2010   February 1, 2009  Weighted average common shares   1,648    1,683    1,682  Effect of potentially dilutive securities:    Stock Plans   10    9    4              Diluted weighted average common shares   1,658    1,692    1,686              ##TABLE_END  Stock plans consist of shares granted under the Companys employee stock plans as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Options to purchase 39 million, 48 million and 52 million shares of common stock at January 30, 2011, January 31, 2010 and February 1, 2009, respectively, were excluded from the computation of Diluted Earnings per Share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_START 11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ##TABLE_END The fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties. A liabilitys fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: ##TABLE_START   Level 1    Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets   Level 2    Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable   Level 3    Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions ##TABLE_END Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The assets and liabilities of the Company that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010 were as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Fair Value at January 30, 2011 Using   Fair Value at January 31, 2010 Using    Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3  Derivative agreements - assets  $    $ 47   $    $    $ 15   $   Derivative agreements - liabilities       (40 )           (4 )                             Total  $    $ 7   $    $    $ 11   $                           ##TABLE_END The Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate exposure on long-term debt and its exposure on foreign currency fluctuations. The fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments was measured using level 2 inputs. The Companys derivative agreements are discussed further in Note 5. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The assets and liabilities of the Company that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Fair Value Measured During Fiscal 2010 Level 3   Gains (Losses)  Store Rationalization - lease obligation costs, net  $ (158 )  $ (9 ) Guarantee of HD Supply loan  $ (67 )   (51 )      Total for fiscal 2010   $ (60 )        Fair Value Measured During Fiscal 2009 Level 3   Gains (Losses)  HD Supply investment  $    $ (163 ) Store Rationalization - lease obligation costs, net  $ (191 )   (84 )      Total for fiscal 2009   $ (247 )      ##TABLE_END  During fiscal 2009, the Company impaired the remaining value of its investment in HD Supply using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3), as further discussed in Note 4. Lease obligation costs included in the Companys Rationalization Charges were measured on a nonrecurring basis using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3), as further discussed in Note 2. Additionally, the guarantee of the HD Supply loan was measured on a nonrecurring basis using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3), as further discussed in Note 4. Long-lived assets and goodwill and other intangible assets were also analyzed for impairment on a nonrecurring basis using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3). Impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets and long-lived assets in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were not material, as further discussed in Note 1 under the captions Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, respectively. The aggregate fair value of the Companys Senior Notes, based on quoted market prices (level 1), was $9.8 billion and $9.5 billion at January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010, respectively, compared to a carrying value of $9.3 billion at both January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010. ##TABLE_START 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ##TABLE_END At January 30, 2011, the Company was contingently liable for approximately $606 million under outstanding letters of credit and open accounts issued for certain business transactions, including insurance programs, trade contracts and construction contracts. The Companys letters of credit are primarily performance-based and are not based on changes in variable components, a liability or an equity security of the other party.

Business. Introduction The Home Depot, Inc. is the worlds largest home improvement retailer based on Net Sales for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2012 (\"fiscal 2011 \"). The Home Depot stores sell a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement and lawn and garden products and provide a number of services. The Home Depot stores average approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. As of the end of fiscal 2011 , we had 2,252 The Home Depot stores located throughout the United States including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam, Canada, China and Mexico. When we refer to \"The Home Depot,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\" in this report, we are referring to The Home Depot, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Home Depot, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1978. Our Store Support Center (corporate office) is located at 2455 Paces Ferry Road, N.W., Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Our telephone number is (770) 433-8211. We maintain an Internet website at www.homedepot.com. We make available on our website, free of charge, our Annual Reports to shareholders, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such documents with, or furnishing such documents to, the SEC. We include our website addresses throughout this filing for reference only. The information contained on our websites is not incorporated by reference into this report. For information on key financial highlights, including historical revenues, profits and total assets, see the \"Five-Year Summary of Financial and Operating Results\" on page F-1 of this report and Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" Our Business Operating Strategy  In fiscal 2011 , we continued to execute on our strategy focused on the following key initiatives: ##TABLE_START  Customer Service . Our customer service initiative is anchored on the principles of putting customers first, taking care of our associates and simplifying the business. To enhance customer service, we introduced new information technology and optimized certain elements of our supply chain to eliminate tasks and give associates more time with customers. We also sought to maintain competitive wages and incentive opportunities to attract, retain and motivate our associates. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Product Authority . Our product authority initiative is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value. In fiscal 2011 , we introduced a wide range of new products to our customers, while remaining focused on offering every day values in our stores. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Productivity and Efficiency . Our productivity and efficiency initiative is advanced through building best-in-class competitive advantages in information technology and supply chain, as well as building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders. By the start of fiscal 2011 , we had completed our Rapid Deployment Center (\"RDC\") rollout, and our focus turned to operating and optimizing our supply chain network. We continued our focus on disciplined capital allocation, expense control and increasing shareholder returns, both through share repurchases and increased dividend payments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Interconnected Retail . As customers increasingly expect to be able to buy how, when and where they want, we believe that providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels will be a key enabler for future success. The interconnected retail initiative is woven throughout our business and connects our other three key initiatives. In fiscal 2011 , we focused in particular on enhancements to our online presence and other customer-facing technology, leveraging multiple channels to expand product assortment and simultaneously simplifying the process of locating and ordering products. ##TABLE_END Customer Service  Our Customers . The Home Depot stores serve three primary customer groups, and we have different customer service approaches to meet their particular needs: ##TABLE_START  Do-It-Yourself (\"D-I-Y\") Customers. These customers are typically home owners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. Our associates assist these customers with specific product and installation questions both in our stores and through online resources and other media designed to provide product and project knowledge. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Do-It-For-Me (\"D-I-F-M\") Customers. These customers are typically home owners who purchase materials themselves and hire third parties to complete the project or installation. Our stores offer a variety of installation services targeted at D-I-F-M customers who select and purchase products and installation of those products from us in the store. Our installation programs include products such as carpeting, flooring, cabinets, countertops and water heaters. In addition, we provide professional installation of a number of products sold through our in-home sales programs, such as roofing, siding, windows, furnaces and central air systems. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Professional Customers . These customers are primarily professional remodelers, general contractors, repairmen, small business owners and tradesmen. We offer a variety of special programs to these customers, including delivery and will-call services, dedicated staff and expanded credit programs. We recognize the unique service needs of the professional customer and use our expertise to facilitate their buying experience. ##TABLE_END In fiscal 2011 , we introduced new information technology to serve our customers more effectively and enhance the overall shopping environment. To improve our labor efficiency, we completed the roll out of our new associate forecast and scheduling system and a centralized returns system in fiscal 2011 . These systems allow us to take tasks out of the stores and allocate more associate hours to assisting customers and to better align our labor hours with customer traffic patterns. As of the end of fiscal 2011 , approximately 53% of our store labor hours were dedicated to customer-facing activity, with a goal of reaching 60% by the end of fiscal 2013. During fiscal 2011 , we also implemented enhancements to our website to improve our customers' experience when shopping online. These include Buy Online, Pick-up In Store (\"BOPIS\"), which allows our customers to choose how they would like to receive merchandise ordered online, and \"SuperSku,\" which provides greater flexibility in how items are displayed online and minimizes the number of clicks necessary to find a product. In February 2012, we rolled out a significant upgrade of our website, which enhances the layout, visual appearance and responsiveness of the site, as well as further reducing the number of clicks necessary to navigate our pages. We help our professional, D-I-Y and D-I-F-M customers finance their projects by offering private label credit products in our stores through third-party credit providers. In fiscal 2011 , approximately 2.4 million new The Home Depot private label credit accounts were opened, and at fiscal year end the total number of The Home Depot active account holders was approximately 10 million. Private label credit card sales accounted for approximately 22% of sales in fiscal 2011 . In addition, to provide alternate payment options to our customers, in fiscal 2011 we launched a pilot program for our in-store customers to use PayPal  and plan to roll it out more broadly in the fiscal year ending February 3, 2013 (\"fiscal 2012 \"). Our Associates. Employee relations matter to us, and our associates are key to our customer service initiative. We empower our associates to deliver excellent customer service through our Customers FIRST training program. At the end of fiscal 2011 , we employed approximately 331,000 associates, of whom approximately 20,000 were salaried, with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis. To attract and retain qualified personnel, we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve. We measure associate satisfaction regularly and maintain multiple means of ensuring effective communications with our associates. We believe that our employee relations are very good. Product Authority Our Products. Our product portfolio strategy is aimed at delivering innovation, assortment and value. A typical Home Depot store stocks approximately 30,000 to 40,000 products during the year, including both national brand name and proprietary items. We also offer over 300,000 products through our website, homedepot.com. To enhance our merchandising capabilities, we made enhancements to our information technology tools in fiscal 2011 to give our merchants and vendors greater visibility into category and item performance. In addition, as part of a multi-phased project to improve our special order performance and make the special order process both simpler and more accurate for our customers and associates, we digitized our vendor catalogs in fiscal 2011 . In fiscal 2011 , we continued to introduce a number of innovative and distinctive products to our customers at attractive values. Examples of these new products include lithium battery technology for power tools, Ryobi  lithium ion cordless outdoor tools, Glidden  DUO  paint + primer, Toro  gas trimmers and organic lawn care products from Vigoro  . To complement and enhance our product selection, we continued to form strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. During fiscal 2011 , we offered a number of proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments, such as Defiant  door locks, Everbilt  hardware fasteners, Husky  paint tools and hand tools, Hampton Bay  lighting, Vigoro  lawn care products, RIDGID  and Ryobi  power tools and Glacier Bay  bath fixtures. We also continued our partnership with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia to offer the exclusive Martha Stewart Living brand in select categories including outdoor living, paint, cabinetry, flooring, and shelving and storage. We will continue to assess strategic alliances and relationships with suppliers and opportunities to expand the range of products available under brand names that are exclusive to The Home Depot. From our Store Support Center, we maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality products directly from manufacturers around the world. Our merchant team identifies and purchases innovative products directly for our stores. Additionally, we have three sourcing offices located in the Chinese cities of Shanghai, Shenzhen and Dalian, and offices in Gurgaon, India; Rome, Italy; Monterrey, Mexico and Toronto, Canada. Quality Assurance . We have both quality assurance and engineering resources that are dedicated to overseeing the quality of all of our products, whether they are directly imported, locally or globally sourced or proprietary branded products. Through these programs, we have established criteria for supplier and product performance that are designed to ensure that our products comply with applicable international, federal, state and local safety, quality and performance standards. We also have a Supplier Social and Environmental Responsibility Program designed to ensure that our suppliers adhere to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility. Energy Saving Products and Programs. As the world's largest home improvement retailer, we are in a unique position to enable our customers to achieve energy savings through our products and services and to educate our customers about \"green\" products and practices. Through our Eco Options  Program introduced in fiscal 2007, we have created product categories that allow consumers to easily identify environmentally preferred product selections in our stores. Our Eco Options  Program has certified over 4,000 products that meet specifications for energy efficiency, water conservation, healthy home, clean air and sustainable forestry. Through this program, we sell products such as ENERGY STAR  refrigerators, dishwashers, compact fluorescent light (\"CFL\") bulbs, EcoSmart  LED light bulbs, programmable thermostats, water heaters and other products, enabling our customers to save on their utility bills. LED light bulbs, which use approximately 85% less energy and last up to 20 years longer than traditional incandescent bulbs, were one of our fastest growing categories for the year. In fiscal 2011, the sales of ENERGY STAR  qualified products helped consumers save over $700 million in annual utility costs, which equate to an over six billion kilowatt reduction and an almost five million ton decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. We also help our customers save water through sales of WaterSense  -labeled bath faucets, showerheads, aerators and toilets. Through the sales of these products, we have helped consumers save over 30 billion gallons of water and over $200 million in water bills. Our Eco Options  page on our website offers consumer education on environmental impacts of various products and identifies easy green D-I-Y projects. This online experience, coupled with our D-I-Y in-store how-to clinics on green projects and our continual enhancement of our Eco Options  product categories, helps us to meet a growing customer demand for environmentally responsible and cost-saving products and projects. In 2011, we also partnered with the U.S. Green Building Council to establish a list of products sold at our stores that meet \"LEED for Homes\" product specifications. This program helps our customers easily identify products with potential Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (\"LEED\") point values and is designed to simplify the complexities of building green. At the end of fiscal 2011 , we had approximately 2,000 LEED for Homes products. We continue to offer our nationwide, in-store CFL bulb recycling program launched in 2008. This service is offered to customers free of charge and is available in all U.S. stores. We also maintain an in-store rechargeable battery recycling program. Launched in 2001 in partnership with the Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation, this program is also available to customers free of charge in all stores throughout the U.S. and Canada. Through these recycling programs, in fiscal 2011 we helped recycle over 480,000 pounds of CFL bulbs and over 770,000 pounds of rechargeable batteries collected from our customers. In fiscal 2011 , we also recycled over 130,000 lead acid batteries collected from our customers under our lead acid battery exchange program, as well as approximately 150,000 tons of cardboard through a nationwide cardboard recycling program across our U.S. stores. Net Sales of Major Product Groups . The following table shows the percentage of Net Sales of each major product group (and related services) for each of the last three fiscal years: ##TABLE_START Product Group Percentage of Net Sales for Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2012  January 30, 2011  January 31, 2010 Plumbing, electrical and kitchen 30.5 %  30.0 %  29.8 % Hardware and seasonal 29.5  29.4  29.1 Building materials, lumber and millwork 21.1  21.7  21.9 Paint and flooring 18.9  18.9  19.2 Total 100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 % ##TABLE_ENDNet Sales outside the U.S. were $8.0 billion , $7.5 billion and $7.0 billion for fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively. Long-lived assets outside the U.S. totaled $3.1 billion , $3.2 billion and $3.0 billion as of January 29, 2012 , January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010 , respectively. Seasonality. Our business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, and the lowest volume occurs during our fourth fiscal quarter. Competition. Our business is highly competitive, based primarily on customer service, price, store location and assortment of merchandise. Although we are currently the worlds largest home improvement retailer, in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. With respect to some products, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and, to a lesser extent, other retailers. In addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers. Intellectual Property. Our business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, e-commerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business. We also maintain patent portfolios relating to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our products or business operations. Productivity and Efficiency Logistics. Our supply chain operations are focused on creating a competitive advantage through ensuring product availability for our customers, effectively using our investment in inventory, and managing total supply chain costs. Following the completion of our RDC rollout, our initiatives in fiscal 2011 have been to further optimize and efficiently operate our network, build new logistics capabilities and improve our inventory management systems and processes. Our distribution strategy is to provide the optimal flow path for a given product. RDCs play a key role in optimizing our network as they allow for aggregation of product needs for multiple stores to a single purchase order and then rapid allocation and deployment of inventory to individual stores upon arrival at the RDC. This results in a simplified ordering process and improved transportation and inventory management. To enhance our RDC network, we continued adding mechanization, and at the end of fiscal 2011 , 15 of our 19 RDCs were mechanized. Over the past two years, we have expanded our transload pilot program to three facilities near ocean ports, with a fourth facility expected to become operational in fiscal 2012 . Transload facilities allow us to improve our import logistics costs and inventory management by enabling imported product to flow through our RDC network. In addition, we implemented a new distribution forecasting and replenishment system to further improve our inventory management. We added approximately 1.5 million net square feet of distribution center space in fiscal 2011 , primarily for new repair and liquidation centers as part of our centralized returns system. These centers consolidate product from our stores to return to our vendors, liquidate or recycle. They also provide a small engine repair service for our stores and customers primarily focused on outdoor and hardware power equipment. At the end of fiscal 2011 , in addition to our 19 RDCs in the U.S., we operated 33 bulk distribution centers, which handle products distributed optimally on flat bed trucks, in the U.S. and Canada. We also operated 35 conventional distribution centers, which include stocking, direct fulfillment and specialty distribution centers, in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In fiscal 2011 we made further progress toward our goal of 75% central distribution penetration. In the U.S. our central distribution penetration was approximately 70% as of the end of fiscal  2011 , with the remainder of goods shipped directly to our stores from our suppliers. We remain committed to leveraging our supply chain capabilities to fully utilize and optimize our improved logistics network. Commitment to Environmentally Responsible Operations . The Home Depot is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner. This commitment impacts all areas of our business, including energy usage, supply chain, store construction and maintenance, and, as noted above under \"Energy Saving Products and Programs,\" product selection and delivery of product knowledge to our customers. In fiscal 2011 , we continued to implement strict operational standards that establish energy efficient practices in all of our facilities. These include HVAC unit temperature regulation and adherence to strict lighting schedules, which are the largest sources of energy consumption in our stores, as well as use of energy management systems in each store to monitor energy efficiency. We estimate that by implementing and utilizing these energy saving programs, we have saved over 4.5 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) since 2004, enough to power approximately 400,000 U.S. homes for one year, and we are on track to meet our goal of a 20% reduction in kWh per square foot in our U.S. stores by 2015. Through our supply chain efficiencies described above under \"Logistics,\" we are targeting a 20% reduction in our domestic supply chain greenhouse gas emissions from 2008 to 2015, which would equate to annual fuel savings of approximately 25 million gallons. In fiscal 2011 , we also calculated our total carbon dioxide emissions for 2010, and we continue to monitor our \"carbon footprint\" from the operation of our stores as well as from our transportation and supply chain activities. Through our energy conservation and supply chain initiatives, we reduced our absolute carbon emissions by approximately 540,000 metric tons in 2010 compared to 2009. With respect to construction of our stores, we partnered with the U.S. Green Building Council and have built seven LEED for New Construction certified and other similarly certified stores. In 2011, we also obtained a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to help design, monitor and verify the energy savings of a new building in Lodi, California that is designed to consume substantially less energy than the 2007 90.1 ASHRAE standards set out by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, an international society that sets forth HVAC and refrigeration standards to promote sustainability. We also implemented a rainwater reclamation pilot in 2010, and we have retrofitted a number of our stores with reclamation tanks to collect rainwater and condensation from HVAC units and garden center roofs, which is in turn used to water plants in our outside garden centers. In September 2011, we opened a store in St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands with both ground mount and roof mount solar panel systems, and we estimate the combined total annual energy production of these systems to be up to 570 megawatt hours. Our efforts have resulted in a number of environmental awards and recognitions. For instance, in 2011, we were named \"Retail Partner of the Year\" by the WaterSense division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for our overall excellence in water efficiency, and we were recognized as a \"High Performer\" by the Carbon Disclosure Project. We are also committed to maintaining a safe environment for our customers and associates and protecting the environment of the communities in which we do business. Our Environmental, Health  Safety (\"EHS\") function is dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of our customers and associates, with trained associates who evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a Company-wide basis. Our EHS policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of The Home Depot culture. Some common program elements include: daily store inspection checklists (by department); routine follow-up audits from our store-based safety team members and regional, district and store operations field teams; equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety; departmental merchandising safety standards; training and education programs for all associates, with more extensive training provided based on an associate's role and responsibilities; and awareness, communication and recognition programs designed to drive operational awareness and understanding of EHS issues. Interconnected Retail Our interconnected retail initiative supports and connects our three other key initiatives. In fiscal 2011, we focused on leveraging technology to improve our customer's retail experience and provide better access to and information about our products. As described above, these efforts included information technology solutions that take tasks out of the store and free our associates to devote more time to customer-facing activities. They also included significant website enhancements and improvements to our special ordering process that allow customers to more easily find and purchase an expanded array of products and provide a choice in how to receive the order (for example, through our BOPIS program). Through our website, which can be accessed through computers, smart phones and other mobile devices, customers can not only purchase products, but can also connect with our associates and with one another to gain product and project knowledge. Furthermore, to increase the productivity and efficiency of our associates, merchants and vendors and ensure that the right product is in the right place to meet our customers' needs, we developed and implemented the improved merchandising tools that provide better visibility into category and item performance and the new distribution forecasting and replenishment system for enhanced inventory management. ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. The risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. The Risk Factors described below include the considerable risks associated with the current economic environment and the related potential adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. You should read these Risk Factors in conjunction with \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item 7 and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item 8. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. Sustained uncertainty regarding current economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. Our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. Adverse conditions in or sustained uncertainty about these markets or the economy could adversely impact consumer confidence, causing our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services. Other factors  including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures, interest rate fluctuations, fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs, the availability of financing, the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit, weather, natural disasters and other conditions beyond our control  could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. We operate in markets that are highly competitive. We compete principally based on customer service, price, store location and appearance, and quality, availability and assortment of merchandise. In each market we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and other retailers, as well as with installers of home improvement products. In addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers. Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors could affect prices or demand for our products and services. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through maintenance of superior customer service and customer loyalty, our financial performance and our market share could be adversely affected. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics, consumer preferences, expectations and needs and unexpected weather conditions, while also managing inventory levels. Failure to maintain attractive stores and to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs. Our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations or healthcare benefits, and health and other insurance costs. In addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. We rely on third party suppliers. If we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our current suppliers experience financial difficulties, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. We buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by political instability, the financial instability of suppliers (particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the world), suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, supply disruptions, shipping interruptions or costs, and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. As part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. If we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation. If we do not maintain the security of customer, associate or company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. Any significant compromise or breach of customer, associate or company data security could significantly damage our reputation and result in significant costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits. The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. There is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. A failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to analyze, process and manage transactions and data. We also rely heavily on the integrity of this data in managing our business. We or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be expensive, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. Disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. Through our information technology developments, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, smart phones and other mobile communication devices. We use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales. We have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. Disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. The implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. We have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology. These initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience. The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. In addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether. Disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. A disruption within our logistics or supply chain network, including damage or destruction to our distribution centers, could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to our reputation. Such a disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. The inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. Prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, increased enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. Recently, there have been a large number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms, as well as increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. Changes in, increased enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements, other wage, labor or workplace regulations, the sale of some of our products, transportation, logistics, taxes, energy costs or environmental matters, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our store operations. Healthcare reform under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 could adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates. Our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if needed, could be adversely affected by the volatility in the capital markets. We obtain and manage liquidity from the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to capital markets, including our commercial paper programs supported by a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks. Although we currently maintain an investment grade rating and had no outstanding commercial paper obligations as of the end of fiscal 2011 , there is no assurance that our ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets, if needed, will not be adversely impacted due to economic conditions. New or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity and volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit, higher cost of borrowing and lack of confidence in the equity market, making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us. If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations. Our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our U.S. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. Our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political and economic conditions. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences, greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights, risks associated with FCPA and local anti-bribery law compliance, challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations. If we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business, we could be subject to fines and lawsuits. We act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our D-I-F-M customers through third-party installers. As such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of our third-party installers. We have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. If we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive verdicts. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of managements attention and resources from other matters. ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Additionally, at the end of fiscal 2011 , we had six Home Decorators Collection locations in Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri and New Jersey. At the end of fiscal 2011 , we utilized 143 warehouses and distribution centers located in 35 states or provinces, consisting of approximately 37.3 million square feet, of which approximately 1.2 million is owned and approximately 36.1 million is leased. Our executive, corporate staff, divisional staff and financial offices occupy approximately 2.1 million square feet of leased and owned space in Atlanta, Georgia. At the end of fiscal 2011 , we occupied an aggregate of approximately 3.9 million square feet, of which approximately 2.3 million square feet is owned and approximately 1.6 million square feet is leased, for store support centers and customer support centers in Atlanta and other locations. ", "3": " Item 3. Legal Proceedings. As previously reported, in July 2005, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, California, seeking documents and information relating to the Company's handling, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. The Company is cooperating fully with the United States Attorney's Office. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding, it does not expect the outcome to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. As previously reported, in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2006, three purported, but uncertified, class actions were filed against the Company, The Home Depot FutureBuilder Administrative Committee and certain of the Company's current and former directors and employees alleging breach of fiduciary duty in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\") in connection with the Company's return-to-vendor and stock option practices. These actions were joined into one case in 2007, and the joint amended complaint seeks certification as a class action, unspecified damages, costs, attorney's fees and equitable and injunctive relief. On June 7, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in Atlanta granted with prejudice Home Depot's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' third amended complaint. On June 28, 2010, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (the \"Circuit Court\"), and on October 7, 2011, the Circuit Court held oral argument on the appeal. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of this matter, it does not expect the outcome to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. As previously reported, in September 2010, the Company was contacted by district attorneys in three counties in California within the South Coast Air Quality Management District (the \"SCAQMD\") and the City of Los Angeles regarding allegations that the Company sold products in those counties with VOC (volatile organic compound) levels in excess of amounts permitted by SCAQMD rules. In June 2011, two related complaints were filed in the Superior Court of California  County of Los Angeles against the Company. The first action was brought by the SCAQMD and alleges that the Company sold products with higher-than-permitted VOC levels. This action seeks $30 million in civil penalties and injunctive relief. The second action was brought by the Los Angeles City Attorney and the district attorneys of each of Orange, Riverside and San Bernadino counties and alleges that the Company engaged in unfair business practices and false advertising when selling these products. This action seeks unspecified civil penalties and injunctive relief. Although the Company cannot predict the outcomes of these matters, it does not expect either to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Shares received in connection with the ASR agreement will be reflected in the share repurchase table in future quarters. Sales of Unregistered Securities During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 , the Company issued 601 deferred stock units under The Home Depot, Inc. NonEmployee Directors Deferred Stock Compensation Plan pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). The deferred stock units were credited to the accounts of those nonemployee directors who elected to receive board retainers in the form of deferred stock units instead of cash during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 . The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 , the Company credited 1,415 deferred stock units to participant accounts under The Home Depot FutureBuilder Restoration Plan pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for involuntary, non-contributory plans. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan.  ", "6": " Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to page F-1 of this report. ", "7": " Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Executive Summary and Selected Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data For the fiscal year ended January 29, 2012 (\"fiscal 2011 \"), we reported Net Earnings of $ 3.9 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $ 2.47 compared to Net Earnings of $ 3.3 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $ 2.01 for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2011 (\"fiscal 2010 \"). Net Sales increased 3.5 % to $ 70.4 billion for fiscal 2011 from $ 68.0 billion for fiscal 2010 . Our comparable store sales increased 3.4% in fiscal 2011 , driven primarily by a 2.6% increase in our comparable store average ticket. Comparable store sales for our U.S. stores increased 3.0% in fiscal 2011 . In fiscal 2011 , we continued to focus on the following four key initiatives: Customer Service  Our focus on customer service is anchored on the principles of putting customers first, taking care of our associates and simplifying the business. In fiscal 2011, we rolled out a new scheduling system for our associates and a new centralized return to vendor process. As a result, we now have approximately 53% of our store labor hours dedicated to customer-facing activity. We have a customer-facing store payroll target of 60%, and we believe we will achieve that goal by 2013. Also in fiscal 2011, we began the process of rolling out in-store repair services for power equipment and power tools, and we believe this will be a significant improvement in convenience for our customers. Product Authority  Our focus on product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, including innovation, assortment and value. We are enhancing our special order system and when completed, this system will make the special order process both simpler and more accurate for our customers and associates. As part of this multi-phased project to improve our special order performance, we digitized our vendor catalogs in fiscal 2011 . We also continued to form strategic alliances and relationships with selected suppliers to bring a number of proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments in fiscal 2011 . Productivity and Efficiency  Our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through building best-in-class competitive advantages in information technology and supply chain, as well as building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In fiscal 2011 , we saw continued benefits from our supply chain investments, which improved our in-stock rate and asset efficiency. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.3 times at the end of fiscal 2011 compared to 4.1 times at the end of fiscal 2010 . Additionally, as of the end of fiscal 2011, we handled approximately 70% of our U.S. Cost of Sales through centralized distribution compared to approximately 25% four years ago. In terms of building shareholder value, we repurchased a total of 97 million shares for $3.5 billion during fiscal 2011. In addition, in November 2011 we announced a 16% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to 29 cents per share. Interconnected Retail  Our focus on interconnected retail is based on the view that providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels will be a critical enabler for future success. Our multiple channel focus is allowing us to greatly expand our assortment of merchandise, and we are making the investment to build these capabilities, including the roll out of Buy On-Line, Pick-up In Store (\"BOPIS\"), which we completed in fiscal 2011. In February 2012, we rolled out a significant upgrade of our website, which enhances the layout, visual appearance and responsiveness of the site. We opened 11 new stores, including two relocations, and closed five stores in fiscal 2011 , bringing our total store count at the end of fiscal 2011 to 2,252. As of the end of fiscal 2011 , a total of 278 of these stores, or 12.3%, were located in Canada, Mexico and China compared to 272 stores, or 12.1%, at the end of fiscal 2010 . We generated $ 6.7 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2011 . We used a portion of this cash flow to fund $2.5 billion of the total $3.5 billion of share repurchases, pay $ 1.6 billion of dividends and fund $ 1.2 billion in capital expenditures. At the end of fiscal 2011 , our long-term debt-to-equity ratio increased to 60.1% from 46.1% at the end of fiscal 2010 driven primarily by higher debt levels. Our return on invested capital (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 14.9% for fiscal 2011 compared to 12.8% for fiscal 2010 . We believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations.  ##TABLE_START  % of Net Sales  % Increase (Decrease) In Dollar Amounts  Fiscal Year (1)     vs. 2010  vs. 2009 NET SALES 100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 %  3.5 %  2.8 % GROSS PROFIT 34.5  34.3  33.9  4.1  4.0 Operating Expenses:          Selling, General and Administrative 22.8  23.3  24.0  1.1  (0.3 ) Depreciation and Amortization 2.2  2.4  2.6  (2.7 )  (5.3 ) Total Operating Expenses 25.0  25.7  26.6  0.8  (0.8 ) OPERATING INCOME 9.5  8.6  7.3  14.1  21.6 Interest and Other (Income) Expense:          Interest and Investment Income       (13.3 )  (16.7 ) Interest Expense 0.9  0.8  1.0  14.3  (21.6 ) Other   0.1  0.2  (100.0 )  (68.7 ) Interest and Other, net 0.8  0.8  1.2  4.8  (31.1 ) EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 8.6  7.8  6.0  15.1  32.4 Provision for Income Taxes 3.1  2.8  2.1  12.9  42.1 EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS 5.5 %  4.9 %  4.0 %  16.3 %  27.4 % SELECTED SALES DATA          Number of Customer Transactions (in millions) 1,317.5  1,305.7  1,274.3  0.9 %  2.5 % Average Ticket $ 53.28  $ 51.93  $ 51.76  2.6 %  0.3 % Weighted Average Weekly Sales per Operating Store (in thousands) $  $  $  3.4 %  3.2 % Weighted Average Sales per Square Foot $ 299.00  $ 288.64  $ 278.97  3.6 %  3.5 % Comparable Store Sales Increase (Decrease) (%) (2) 3.4 %  2.9 %  (6.6 )%  N/A  N/A ##TABLE_ENDNote: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding.   ##TABLE_START (1) Fiscal years 2011 , 2010 and 2009 refer to the fiscal years ended January 29, 2012 , January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010 , respectively.

Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 365 th day of operation. Comparable store sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for Net Sales or Net Earnings presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ##TABLE_END N/A  Not Applicable Results of Operations For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this report. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010  Net Sales Net Sales for fiscal 2011  increased  3.5% to $70.4 billion from $68.0 billion for fiscal 2010 . The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2011 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales. Total comparable store sales increased 3.4% for fiscal 2011 compared to an increase of 2.9% for fiscal 2010 . The positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2011 reflect a number of factors including the execution of our key initiatives, economic growth and favorable weather conditions. We experienced positive comparable store sales in 12 of our 14 departments for fiscal 2011 . Comparable store sales for our Building Materials, Paint, Hardware, Tools, Plumbing, Electrical and Kitchen product categories were above the Company average for fiscal 2011 . Comparable store sales for our Flooring, Bath, Lighting, Outdoor Garden and Indoor Garden product categories were positive for fiscal 2011 . Comparable store sales for our Lumber and Millwork product categories were negative for fiscal 2011 . The increase in comparable store sales also reflects a 2.6% increase in our comparable store average ticket and an 0.8% increase in our comparable store customer transactions. We believe that our sales performance has been, and could continue to be, negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets. We estimate our share of the U.S. home improvement market is approximately 25% using the U.S. Census Bureaus North American Industry Classification System, or NAICS, 4441 classification for building material and supplies dealers. Gross Profit Gross Profit increased  4.1% to $24.3 billion for fiscal 2011 from $23.3 billion for fiscal 2010 . Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 34.5% for fiscal 2011 compared to 34.3% for fiscal 2010 , an increase of 20 basis points. The increase in gross profit margin in fiscal 2011 was driven primarily by benefits arising from our supply chain transformation in the U.S., which was partially offset by higher shrink compared to last year. Operating Expenses Selling, General and Administrative expenses (\"SGA\") increased  1.1% to $16.0 billion for fiscal 2011 from $15.8 billion for fiscal 2010 . As a percent of Net Sales, SGA was 22.8% for fiscal 2011 compared to 23.3% for fiscal 2010 . The decrease in SGA as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2011 reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment partially offset by a $32 million impairment charge for a non-core carpet cleaning and cabinet refinishing business that was sold in fiscal 2011 and $26 million of expenses related to natural disasters. Additionally, we experienced an expense benefit of $44 million in fiscal 2010 related to our private label credit card that did not repeat in fiscal 2011. Depreciation and Amortization was $1.6 billion for both fiscal 2011 and 2010 . Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.2% for fiscal 2011 compared to 2.4% for fiscal 2010 . The decrease in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment and an increase in fully depreciated assets. Operating Income Operating Income increased  14.1% to $6.7 billion for fiscal 2011 from $5.8 billion for fiscal 2010 . Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 9.5% for fiscal 2011 compared to 8.6% for fiscal 2010 . Interest and Other, net In fiscal 2011 , we recognized $593 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $566 million for fiscal 2010 . Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.8% for both fiscal 2011 and 2010 . Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2010 reflects a $51 million pretax charge related to the extension of our guarantee of a senior secured loan of HD Supply, Inc. (the \"HD Supply Guarantee Extension\"). Additionally, we experienced a $44 million benefit in fiscal 2010 that arose from favorable Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") guidance and a resulting reversal of an interest accrual. Provision for Income Taxes Our combined effective income tax rate decreased to 36.0% for fiscal 2011 from 36.7% for fiscal 2010 . The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 reflects a benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards as well as certain favorable state and local tax settlements. Diluted Earnings per Share Diluted Earnings per Share were $2.47 for fiscal 2011 compared to $2.01 for fiscal 2010 . Excluding the HD Supply Guarantee Extension charge from our fiscal 2010 results, Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2010 were $2.03. Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2011 reflect $0.13 of benefit from repurchases of our common stock in the twelve months ended January 29, 2012. Non-GAAP Measures To provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with non-GAAP financial measures to reflect certain adjustments for fiscal 2010 and 2009. The results for fiscal 2010 included a $51 million pretax charge related to the HD Supply Guarantee Extension as described more fully in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The results for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2010 (\"fiscal 2009\") reflected the impact of several strategic actions initiated in fiscal 2008. These strategic actions resulted in store rationalization charges related to the closing of 15 underperforming U.S. stores and the removal of approximately 50 stores from our new store pipeline, business rationalization charges related to the exit of our EXPO, THD Design Center, Yardbirds and HD Bath businesses (the \"Exited Businesses\") and charges related to the restructuring of support functions (collectively, the \"Rationalization Charges\"), as described more fully in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These actions resulted in pretax Rationalization Charges of $146 million for fiscal 2009. The results for fiscal 2009 also included a pretax charge of $163 million to write-down our investment in HD Supply as described more fully in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency that impact the comparability of underlying business results from period to period. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. There were no adjustments for fiscal 2011, and the following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures for fiscal 2010 and 2009 (amounts in millions, except per share data):  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 30, 2011  As Reported  Adjustment  Non-GAAP Measures  % of Net Sales Net Sales $ 67,997  $   $ 67,997  100.0 % Cost of Sales 44,693    44,693  65.7 Gross Profit 23,304    23,304  34.3 Operating Expenses:        Selling, General and Administrative 15,849    15,849  23.3 Depreciation and Amortization 1,616    1,616  2.4 Total Operating Expenses 17,465    17,465  25.7 Operating Income 5,839    5,839  8.6 Interest and Other, net    0.8 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes 5,273  (51 )  5,324  7.8 Provision for Income Taxes 1,935  (18 )  1,953  2.9 Earnings from Continuing Operations $ 3,338  $ (33 )  $ 3,371  5.0 % Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations $ 2.01  $ (0.02 )  $ 2.03  N/A ##TABLE_ENDNon-GAAP Measures (continued): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2010  As Reported  Adjustments  Non-GAAP Measures  % of Net Sales Net Sales $ 66,176  $  $ 65,955  100.0 % Cost of Sales 43,764   43,571  66.1 Gross Profit 22,412   22,384  33.9 Operating Expenses:        Selling, General and Administrative 15,902   15,732  23.9 Depreciation and Amortization 1,707   1,703  2.6 Total Operating Expenses 17,609   17,435  26.4 Operating Income 4,803  (146 )  4,949  7.5 Interest and Other, net    1.0 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes 3,982  (309 )  4,291  6.5 Provision for Income Taxes 1,362  (118 )  1,480  2.2 Earnings from Continuing Operations $ 2,620  $ (191 )  $ 2,811  4.3 % Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations $ 1.55  $ (0.11 )  $ 1.66  N/A ##TABLE_ENDFiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Net Sales Net Sales for fiscal 2010 increased 2.8% to $68.0 billion from $66.2 billion for fiscal 2009. The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2010 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales. Total comparable store sales increased 2.9% for fiscal 2010 compared to a decrease of 6.6% for fiscal 2009. The increase in comparable store sales for fiscal 2010 reflects a number of factors. We experienced positive comparable store sales in 12 of our 14 departments for fiscal 2010. Comparable store sales for our Lumber, Tools, Electrical, Indoor Garden, Outdoor Garden and Kitchen product categories were above the Company average for fiscal 2010. The increase in comparable store sales also reflects a 2.4% increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 0.5% increase in our comparable store average ticket. Gross Profit Gross Profit increased 4.0% to $23.3 billion for fiscal 2010 from $22.4 billion for fiscal 2009. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 34.3% for fiscal 2010 compared to 33.9% for fiscal 2009, an increase of 40 basis points. Our U.S. stores experienced gross profit margin expansion in fiscal 2010 as we realized benefits from better product assortment management through our portfolio approach and leveraging of our newly developed merchandising tools. Lower levels of clearance inventory in our stores for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 also contributed to this expansion. Additionally, we realized gross profit margin expansion from our non-U.S. businesses, primarily Canada, due primarily to a change in the mix of products sold. Operating Expenses SGA decreased 0.3% to $15.8 billion for fiscal 2010 from $15.9 billion for fiscal 2009. As a percent of Net Sales, SGA was 23.3% for fiscal 2010 compared to 24.0% for fiscal 2009. Excluding the Rationalization Charges, SGA as a percent of Net Sales was 23.9% for fiscal 2009. The decrease in SGA as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2010 reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment and lower payroll and other expenses. Depreciation and Amortization decreased 5.3% to $1.6 billion for fiscal 2010 from $1.7 billion for fiscal 2009. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.4% for fiscal 2010 compared to 2.6% for fiscal 2009. The decrease in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to a smaller depreciable fixed asset base compared to fiscal 2009, arising from fully depreciated assets. Operating Income Operating Income increased 21.6% to $5.8 billion for fiscal 2010 from $4.8 billion for fiscal 2009. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 8.6% for fiscal 2010 compared to 7.3% for fiscal 2009. Excluding the Rationalization Charges from the results of fiscal 2009, Operating Income increased 18.0% for fiscal 2010. Interest and Other, net In fiscal 2010, we recognized $566 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $821 million for fiscal 2009. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.8% for fiscal 2010 compared to 1.2% for fiscal 2009. Interest and Other, net, reflects a $51 million charge in fiscal 2010 related to the HD Supply Guarantee Extension and a $163 million charge in fiscal 2009 to write-down our investment in HD Supply. Excluding these charges, Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.8% for fiscal 2010 compared to 1.0% for fiscal 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a $44 million benefit arising from favorable IRS guidance resulting in the reversal of an interest accrual during fiscal 2010, a lower cost of outstanding indebtedness than fiscal 2009 and an interest benefit arising from certain state income tax settlements. Provision for Income Taxes Our combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations increased to 36.7% for fiscal 2010 from 34.2% for fiscal 2009. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 included benefits arising from a favorable foreign tax settlement and a realignment of our foreign corporate structure. Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $2.01 for fiscal 2010 and $1.55 for fiscal 2009. Excluding the HD Supply Guarantee Extension charge from our fiscal 2010 results, and the Rationalization Charges and the write-down of our investment in HD Supply from our fiscal 2009 results, Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations for fiscal 2010 were $2.03 compared to $1.66 for fiscal 2009, an increase of 22.3%. Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations for fiscal 2010 reflect $0.04 of benefit from repurchases of our common stock. Discontinued Operations On August 30, 2007, we closed the sale of HD Supply. Discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 consist of earnings of $41 million, net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of HD Supply. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. For fiscal 2011 , Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $ 6.7 billion compared to $ 4.6 billion for fiscal 2010 . This increase was primarily a result of an increase in Net Earnings, changes in inventory levels and other net working capital items. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities for fiscal 2011 was $ 1.1 billion compared to $ 1.0 billion for fiscal 2010 . This change was primarily due to increased Capital Expenditures and Payments for Business Acquired related to the purchase of an online home services platform, partially offset by Proceeds from Sale of Business related to the sale of a non-core carpet cleaning and cabinet refinishing business. In fiscal 2011 , we spent $ 1.2 billion on Capital Expenditures, allocated as follows: 35% for core technology, 17% for maintenance, 17% for merchandising and operations, 11% for new stores and 20% for other initiatives. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities for fiscal 2011 was $ 4.0 billion compared to $ 4.5 billion for fiscal 2010 . In March 2011, we issued $1.0 billion of 4.40% Senior Notes due April 1, 2021 at a discount of $2 million and $1.0 billion of 5.95% Senior Notes due April 1, 2041 at a discount of $4 million (together, the \"March 2011 issuance\"). Interest on these Senior Notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2011. The net proceeds of the March 2011 issuance were used to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock under an Accelerated Share Repurchase (\"ASR\") agreement, and the balance of the net proceeds was used to repay our 5.20% Senior Notes that matured March 1, 2011 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. In connection with the March 2011 issuance, we entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock. Under the agreement, we paid $1.0 billion to the financial institution and received a total of 27 million shares in fiscal 2011. Also in fiscal 2011, we repurchased an additional 70 million shares of our common stock for $2.5 billion through the open market. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2002, we have repurchased 931 million shares of our common stock for a total of $33.6 billion. As of January 29, 2012, $6.4 billion remained under our share repurchase authorization. In May 2010, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $500 million, which was accounted for as a cash flow hedge, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the March 2011 issuance. Upon the March 2011 issuance, we settled this forward starting interest rate swap agreement for an immaterial amount. We have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. In connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. As of January 29, 2012 , there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility. The credit facility expires in July 2013 and contains various restrictive covenants. As of January 29, 2012 , we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. We use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers and store support centers. The net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-Term Debt and Current Installments of Long-Term Debt. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 29, 2012 , we guaranteed a $1.0 billion senior secured amortizing term loan in connection with the sale of HD Supply. We are responsible for up to $1.0 billion and any unpaid interest in the event of nonpayment by HD Supply. As reported in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q of HD Supply for the period ended October 30, 2011 , the outstanding balance of this term loan as of October 30, 2011 was $ 930 million . The guaranteed loan is collateralized by certain assets of HD Supply. The original expiration date of the guarantee was August 30, 2012. On March 19, 2010, we amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to April 1, 2014. The fair value of the guarantee at August 30, 2007 was $16 million and was recorded as a liability in Other Long-Term Liabilities. The extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to $67 million, resulting in a $51 million charge to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2010. As of January 29, 2012 , we had $ 2.0 billion in Cash and Cash Equivalents. We believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. In March 2011, we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on March 1, 2016, with a notional amount of $500 million, accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on our 5.40% Senior Notes due March 1, 2016 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 300 basis points. At January 29, 2012 , the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $39 million, which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement. Also at January 29, 2012 , we had outstanding interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, that expire on December 16, 2013 with a notional amount of $1.25 billion that swap fixed rate interest on our $1.25 billion 5.25% Senior Notes due December 16, 2013 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 259 basis points. At January 29, 2012 , the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of $52 million, which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreements. In March 2012, we entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock. Under the agreement, we paid $1.0 billion to the financial institution, using cash on hand, and received an initial delivery of approximately 17 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement will be determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the ASR agreement. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of January 29, 2012 (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual Obligations Total   2013-2014  2015-2016  Thereafter Total Debt (1) $ 18,660  $  $ 2,259  $ 3,899  $ 11,980 Capital Lease Obligations (2) 1,259     Operating Leases 7,999   1,428  1,194  4,577 Purchase Obligations (3) 3,412  1,602  1,805    Unrecognized Tax Benefits (4)        Total $ 31,427  $ 3,127  $ 5,696  $ 5,281  $ 17,323 ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1) Excludes present value of capital lease obligations of $449 million. Includes $8.3 billion of interest payments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Includes $ 810 million of imputed interest. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, software acquisitions and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Excludes $524 million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. ##TABLE_END Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. Interest rate swap agreements are used, at times, to manage our fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. At January 29, 2012 , after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, approximately 82% of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate debt and 18% was floating-rate debt. A 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our results of operations. As of January 29, 2012 we had, net of discounts, $ 10.3 billion of Senior Notes outstanding. The aggregate market value of these publicly traded Senior Notes as of January 29, 2012 was approximately $ 12.1 billion . Although we have international operating entities, our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition or results of operations. Impact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices We have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates. Revenues We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. We have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. However, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely impacted. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. We also record Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. Merchandise Inventories Our Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, with approximately 81% valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method. Retailers like us, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, Merchandise Inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. We evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the end of fiscal 2011 or 2010 . Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, \"swell\") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. We estimate shrink as a percent of Net Sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. The estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2011 , 2010 or 2009 . Self-Insurance We are self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, workers compensation, medical, product liability and automobile claims. Our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates, and is reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2011 , 2010 or 2009 . Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. We believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors. Volume rebates and certain advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in SGA. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, managements decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, we also recognize in SGA the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of long-lived assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition and inflation. A 10% decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations. Our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations. As part of our Rationalization Charges, we recorded no material lease obligation costs in fiscal 2011 and 2010 and recorded $84 million of lease obligation costs in fiscal 2009. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the Rationalization Charges. A 10% decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10% increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations. We also recorded impairments and other lease obligation costs on other closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2011 , 2010 or 2009 . Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. The fair values of our identified reporting units were estimated using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows. We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition, inflation and discount rates. A 10% decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting units tested would result in an impairment that is not material to our results of operations. A 1.0 percentage point increase in the discount rate used would also result in an impairment that is not material to our results of operations. We amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to ten years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. Impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets were not material for fiscal 2011 , 2010 or 2009 . Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, \"Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income\" (\"ASU No. 2011-05\"). ASU No. 2011-05 eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity and Comprehensive Income. Under ASU No. 2011-05, an entity can elect to present items of net earnings and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements. This guidance is effective for publicly traded companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter, and retrospective application is required. As we report other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity and Comprehensive Income, the adoption of ASU No. 2011-05 will impact the presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. In June 2009, the FASB issued \"Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)\" (\"FASB ASC Subtopic 810-10\"), which clarifies that the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an entitys purpose and design and a companys ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. FASB ASC Subtopic 810-10 requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and eliminates the qualifying special purpose entity concept. FASB ASC Subtopic 810-10 also requires additional disclosures about a companys involvement in variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement. This guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. This guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ", "7A": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

The financial statements of the Company have been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their accompanying report is based upon an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting solely of independent directors, meets five times a year with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and representatives of management to discuss auditing and financial reporting matters. In addition, a telephonic meeting is held prior to each quarterly earnings release.

Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2012 based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 29, 2012 in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2012 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included on page 28 in this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START /s/ F RANCIS S.

The Home Depot, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, The Home Depot, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2012 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Stockholders Equity and Comprehensive Income, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 29, 2012 , and our report dated March 22, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/ KPMG LLP Atlanta, Georgia March 22, 2012  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders The Home Depot, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Stockholders Equity and Comprehensive Income, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 29, 2012 . These Consolidated Financial Statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Consolidated Financial Statements based on our audits.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 29, 2012 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business, Consolidation and Presentation The Home Depot, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") operate The Home Depot stores, which are full-service, warehouse-style stores averaging approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. The stores stock approximately 30,000 to 40,000 different kinds of building materials, home improvement supplies and lawn and garden products that are sold to do-it-yourself customers, do-it-for-me customers and professional customers. The Company also offers over 300,000 products through its website, homedepot.com. At the end of fiscal 2011 , the Company was operating 2,252 The Home Depot stores, which included 1,974 stores in the United States, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam (\"U.S.\"), 180 stores in Canada, 91 stores in Mexico and 7 stores in China. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year is a 52 - or 53 -week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31 . Fiscal years ended January 29, 2012 (\"fiscal 2011 \"), January 30, 2011 (\"fiscal 2010 \") and January 31, 2010 (\"fiscal 2009 \") include 52 weeks. Use of Estimates Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses in preparing these financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Receivables and Accounts Payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments. The fair value of the Companys Long-Term Debt is discussed in Note 11. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Companys cash equivalents are carried at fair market value and consist primarily of money market funds. Accounts Receivable The Company has an agreement with a third-party service provider who directly extends credit to customers, manages the Companys private label credit card program and owns the related receivables. The Company evaluated the third-party entities holding the receivables under the program and concluded that they should not be consolidated by the Company. The agreement with the third-party service provider expires in 2018 , with the Company having the option, but no obligation, to purchase the receivables at the end of the agreement. The deferred interest charges incurred by the Company for its deferred financing programs offered to its customers are included in Cost of Sales. The interchange fees charged to the Company for the customers use of the cards and any profit sharing with the third-party administrator are included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses (\"SGA\"). The sum of the three is referred to by the Company as \"the cost of credit\" of the private label credit card program. In addition, certain subsidiaries of the Company extend credit directly to customers in the ordinary course of business. The receivables due from customers were $ 45 million and $ 42 million as of January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011 , respectively. The Companys valuation reserve related to accounts receivable was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of the end of fiscal 2011 or 2010 . Merchandise Inventories The majority of the Companys Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, as determined by the retail inventory method. As the inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, the inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Certain subsidiaries, including retail operations in Canada, Mexico and China, and distribution centers, record Merchandise Inventories at the lower of cost or market, as determined by a cost method. These Merchandise Inventories represent approximately 19% of the total Merchandise Inventories balance. The Company evaluates the inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of the end of fiscal 2011 or 2010 . Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in stores, the Company accrues for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis based on historical shrink results and current trends in the business. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, \"swell\") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. The Company provides for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as for those deferred due to timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Non-U.S. subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, are not eligible to be included in the Companys consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Separate provisions for income taxes have been determined for these entities. The Company intends to reinvest substantially all of the unremitted earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries and postpone their remittance indefinitely. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes for these non-U.S. subsidiaries was recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Depreciation and Amortization The Companys Buildings, Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold Improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the original term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. The Companys Property and Equipment is depreciated using the following estimated useful lives:  ##TABLE_START  Life Buildings 5  45 years Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment 2  20 years Leasehold Improvements 5  45 years ##TABLE_ENDCapitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to six years. These costs are included in Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred. Revenues The Company recognizes revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. The liability for sales returns is estimated based on historical return levels. When the Company receives payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. The Company also records Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognizes this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. Gift card breakage income is recognized based upon historical redemption patterns and represents the balance of gift cards for which the Company believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote. During fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , the Company recognized $ 42 million , $ 46 million and $ 40 million , respectively, of gift card breakage income. This income is included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a reduction in SGA. Services Revenue Net Sales include services revenue generated through a variety of installation, home maintenance and professional service programs. In these programs, the customer selects and purchases material for a project and the Company provides or arranges professional installation. These programs are offered through the Companys stores and in-home sales programs. Under certain programs, when the Company provides or arranges the installation of a project and the subcontractor provides material as part of the installation, both the material and labor are included in services revenue. The Company recognizes this revenue when the service for the customer is complete. All payments received prior to the completion of services are recorded in Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Services revenue was $ 2.9 billion , $ 2.7 billion and $ 2.6 billion for fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively. Self-Insurance The Company is self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, workers compensation, medical, product liability and automobile claims. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date is not discounted and is recognized as a liability. The expected ultimate cost of claims is estimated based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. Prepaid Advertising Television and radio advertising production costs, along with media placement costs, are expensed when the advertisement first appears. Amounts included in Other Current Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to prepayments of production costs for print and broadcast advertising as well as sponsorship promotions were not material at the end of fiscal 2011 and 2010 . Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and certain advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense. In fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , gross advertising expense was $ 846 million , $ 864 million and $ 897 million , respectively, and is included in SGA. Specific, incremental and identifiable advertising co-op allowances were $ 94 million , $ 90 million and $ 105 million for fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively, and are recorded as an offset to advertising expense in SGA. Cost of Sales Cost of Sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed, the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to the Companys stores, locations or customers, the operating cost of the Companys sourcing and distribution network and the cost of deferred interest programs offered through the Companys private label credit card program. The cost of handling and shipping merchandise from the Companys stores, locations or distribution centers to the customer is classified as SGA. The cost of shipping and handling, including internal costs and payments to third parties, classified as SGA was $ 430 million , $ 410 million and $ 386 million in fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates its long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, managements decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, the Company also recognizes in SGA the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. As part of its Rationalization Charges, the Company recorded no material lease obligation costs in fiscal 2011 and 2010 and recorded $ 84 million of lease obligation costs in fiscal 2009 . See Note 2 for more details on the Rationalization Charges. The Company also recorded impairments and other lease obligation costs on other closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 . Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. The Company does not amortize goodwill but does assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. The fair values of the Companys identified reporting units were estimated using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows. The Company amortizes the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to ten years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. Impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets were not material for fiscal 2011 , 2010 or 2009 . Stock-Based Compensation The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was $ 7.42 , $ 6.70 and $ 6.61 , respectively. The fair value of these options was determined at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  January 29, 2012  January 30, 2011  January 31, 2010 Risk-free interest rate 2.0 %  3.1 %  2.3 % Assumed volatility 27.3 %  26.4 %  41.5 % Assumed dividend yield 2.7 %  2.9 %  3.9 % Assumed lives of option 5 years  5 years  6 years ##TABLE_ENDDerivatives The Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate exposure on long-term debt and its exposure on foreign currency fluctuations. The Company accounts for its derivative financial instruments in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (\"FASB ASC\") Subtopic 815-10. The fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments is discussed in Note 11. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive Income includes Net Earnings adjusted for certain gains and losses that are excluded from Net Earnings under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Adjustments to Net Earnings and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income consist primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses are generally translated using average exchange rates for the period and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the day of the transaction. Segment Information The Company operates within a single reportable segment primarily within North America. Net Sales for the Company outside the U.S. were $ 8.0 billion , $ 7.5 billion and $ 7.0 billion for fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively. Long-lived assets outside the U.S. totaled $ 3.1 billion and $ 3.2 billion as of January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011 , respectively. Reclassifications Certain amounts in prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform with the presentation adopted in the current fiscal year. 2. RATIONALIZATION CHARGES In fiscal 2008, the Company reduced its square footage growth plans to improve free cash flow, provide stronger returns for the Company and invest in its existing stores to continue improving the customer experience. As a result of this store rationalization plan, the Company determined that it would no longer pursue the opening of approximately 50 U.S. stores that had been in its new store pipeline. The Company expects to dispose of or sublet any remaining pipeline locations over varying periods. The Company also closed 15 underperforming U.S. stores in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, and the Company expects to dispose of or sublet any remaining locations over varying periods. Also in fiscal 2008, the Company announced that it would exit its EXPO, THD Design Center, Yardbirds and HD Bath businesses (the \"Exited Businesses\") in order to focus on its core The Home Depot stores. The Company closed the Exited Businesses in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and expects to dispose of or sublet any remaining locations over varying periods. These steps impacted approximately 5,000 associates in those locations, their support functions and their distribution centers. Finally, in January 2009 the Company also restructured its support functions to better align the Companys cost structure. These actions impacted approximately 2,000 associates. The Company did not incur any material charges related to these actions (collectively, the \"Rationalization Charges\") in fiscal 2011 and 2010 and recognized $ 146 million and $ 951 million in total pretax charges for fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company does not expect any further material charges related to these actions. Activity related to Rationalization Charges for fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  Asset Impairments  Lease Obligation Costs, net  Severance  Other  Total Accrued Balance at February 1, 2009 $  $  $  $  $ Fiscal 2009 Charges      Cash Uses      Non-cash Activity       Accrued Balance at January 31, 2010       Cash Uses        Non-cash Activity  (9 )      Accrued Balance at January 30, 2011       Cash Uses        Non-cash Activity  (15 )      (13 ) Accrued Balance at January 29, 2012 $  $  $   $   $ ##TABLE_ENDCosts related to asset impairments, lease obligations, severance and other miscellaneous costs are included in SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Asset impairment charges, including contractual costs to complete certain assets, were determined based on fair market value using market data for each individual property. Lease obligation costs represent the present value of contractually obligated rental payments offset by estimated sublet income, including estimates of the time required to sublease the locations. The payments related to the leased locations therefore are not generally incremental uses of cash.  3. HD SUPPLY DISPOSITION On August 30, 2007 , the Company closed the sale of HD Supply, Inc. In accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 360-10, the Company reclassified the results of HD Supply as discontinued operations in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. Settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of HD Supply resulted in earnings from discontinued operations of $ 41 million , net of tax, in fiscal 2009. In connection with the sale, the Company purchased a 12.5% equity interest in the newly formed HD Supply for $ 325 million . In fiscal 2008, the Company determined its 12.5% equity interest in HD Supply was impaired and recorded a $ 163 million charge to write-down the investment. In fiscal 2009, the Company determined its equity interest in HD Supply was further impaired and recorded an additional charge of $ 163 million to write-down the remaining investment, which is included in Interest and Other, net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Also in connection with the sale, the Company guaranteed a $ 1.0 billion senior secured amortizing term loan of HD Supply. The Company is responsible for up to $ 1.0 billion and any unpaid interest in the event of nonpayment by HD Supply. As reported in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q of HD Supply for the period ended October 30, 2011 , the outstanding balance of this term loan as of October 30, 2011 was $ 930 million . The guaranteed loan is collateralized by certain assets of HD Supply. The original expiration date of the guarantee was August 30, 2012 . On March 19, 2010 , the Company amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to April 1, 2014 . The fair value of the guarantee at August 30, 2007 was $ 16 million and was recorded as a liability of the Company in Other Long-Term Liabilities. The extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to $ 67 million , resulting in a $ 51 million charge to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2010. 4. DEBT The Company has commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . All of the Companys short-term borrowings in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were under these commercial paper programs. In connection with the commercial paper programs, the Company has a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . The credit facility expires in July 2013 and contains various restrictive covenants. At January 29, 2012 , the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact the Companys liquidity or capital resources. Short-term debt under the commercial paper programs was as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  January 29, 2012  January 30, 2011 Balance outstanding at fiscal year-end $   $  Maximum amount outstanding at any month-end $  $  Average daily short-term borrowings $  $ Weighted average interest rate 0.5 %  0.4 % ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys Long-Term Debt at the end of fiscal 2011 and 2010 consisted of the following (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  January 29, 2012  January 30, 2011 5.20% Senior Notes; due March 1, 2011; interest payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 $   $ 1,000 5.25% Senior Notes; due December 16, 2013; interest payable semi-annually on June 16 and December 16 1,309  1,297 5.40% Senior Notes; due March 1, 2016; interest payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 3,069  3,033 3.95% Senior Notes; due September 15, 2020; interest payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15  4.40% Senior Notes; due April 1, 2021; interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1   5.875% Senior Notes; due December 16, 2036; interest payable semi-annually on June 16 and December 16 2,961  2,960 5.40% Senior Notes; due September 15, 2040; interest payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15  5.95% Senior Notes; due April 1, 2041; interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1   Capital Lease Obligations; payable in varying installments through January 31, 2055  Other  Total debt 10,788  9,749 Less current installments  1,042 Long-Term Debt, excluding current installments $ 10,758  $ 8,707 ##TABLE_ENDIn March 2011 , the Company entered into an interest rate swap that expires on March 1, 2016 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on the Company's 5.40% Senior Notes due March 1, 2016 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 300 basis points. At January 29, 2012 , the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $39 million , which is the estimated amount the Company would have received to settle the agreement and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Also at January 29, 2012 , the Company had outstanding interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, that expire on December 16, 2013 with a notional amount of $1.25 billion that swap fixed rate interest on the Companys $1.25 billion  5.25% Senior Notes due December 16, 2013 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 259 basis points. At January 29, 2012 , the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of $52 million , which is the estimated amount the Company would have received to settle the agreements and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. In March 2011 , the Company issued $1.0 billion of 4.40% Senior Notes due April 1, 2021 at a discount of $2 million and $1.0 billion of 5.95% Senior Notes due April 1, 2041 at a discount of $4 million (together, the \" March 2011 issuance\"). Interest on these Senior Notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2011 . The net proceeds of the March 2011 issuance were used to repurchase $1.0 billion of the Companys common stock through an Accelerated Share Repurchase (\"ASR\") agreement, and the balance of the net proceeds was used to repay the Companys 5.20% Senior Notes that matured March 1, 2011 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion . The $6 million discount associated with the March 2011 issuance is being amortized over the lives of the Senior Notes using the effective interest rate method. Issuance costs were approximately $15 million and are being amortized over the lives of the Senior Notes issued in March 2011 . In May 2010 , the Company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a cash flow hedge, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the March 2011 issuance. Upon the March 2011 issuance, the Company settled this forward starting interest rate swap agreement for an immaterial amount. In September 2010 , the Company issued $500 million of 3.95% Senior Notes due September 15, 2020 at a discount of $1 million and $500 million of 5.40% Senior Notes due September 15, 2040 at a discount of $1 million (together, the \" September 2010 issuance\"). Interest on these Senior Notes is due semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The net proceeds of the September 2010 issuance were used to refinance the Companys 4.625% Senior Notes that matured August 15, 2010 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion . The $2 million discount associated with the September 2010 issuance is being amortized over the lives of the Senior Notes using the effective interest rate method. Issuance costs were $8 million and are being amortized over the lives of the Senior Notes issued in September 2010 . In fiscal 2009 and 2010 , the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of $1.0 billion to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the September 2010 issuance, accounted for as cash flow hedges. Upon the September 2010 issuance, the Company paid $193 million to settle these forward starting interest rate swap agreements. This amount, net of income taxes, is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and is being amortized to Interest Expense over the lives of the Senior Notes issued in September 2010 . The Senior Notes may be redeemed by the Company at any time, in whole or in part, at the redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed, and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, if a Change in Control Triggering Event occurs, as defined by the terms of the March 2011 issuance, the September 2010 issuance, and the 5.25% Senior Notes and the 5.875% Senior Notes issuance (together the \"December 2006 issuance\"), holders of the March 2011 issuance, September 2010 issuance and December 2006 issuance have the right to require the Company to redeem those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The Company is generally not limited under the indenture governing the Senior Notes in its ability to incur additional indebtedness or required to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. Further, while the indenture governing the Senior Notes contains various restrictive covenants, none is expected to impact the Companys liquidity or capital resources. At January 29, 2012 , the Company had outstanding cross currency swap agreements with a notional amount of $390 million , accounted for as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency fluctuations on certain intercompany debt. At January 29, 2012 , the approximate fair value of these agreements was a liability of $27 million , which is the estimated amount the Company would have paid to settle the agreements and is included in Other Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings is net of interest capitalized of $3 million , $3 million and $4 million in fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively. Maturities of Long-Term Debt are $30 million for fiscal 2012 , $1.3 billion for fiscal 2013 , $30 million for fiscal 2014 , $27 million for fiscal 2015 , $3.1 billion for fiscal 2016 and $6.3 billion thereafter. 5. ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS In March 2011 , the Company entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.0 billion of the Companys common stock. Under the agreement, the Company paid $1.0 billion to the financial institution, using a portion of the proceeds from the March 2011 issuance, and received a total of 27 million shares in fiscal 2011. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement was determined with reference to the average price of the Companys common stock over the term of the ASR agreement. The $1.0 billion of shares repurchased are included in Treasury Stock in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 29, 2012 . In March 2012 , the Company entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $ 1.0 billion of the Companys common stock. Under the agreement, the Company paid $ 1.0 billion to the financial institution, using cash on hand, and received an initial delivery of approximately 17 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement will be determined with reference to the average price of the Companys common stock over the term of the ASR agreement. 6. INCOME TAXES The components of Earnings from Continuing Operations before Provision for Income Taxes for fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 were as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  January 29, 2012  January 30, 2011  January 31, 2010 United States $ 5,508  $ 4,854  $ 3,586 Foreign   Total $ 6,068  $ 5,273  $ 3,982 ##TABLE_ENDThe Provision for Income Taxes consisted of the following (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  January 29, 2012  January 30, 2011  January 31, 2010 Current:      Federal $ 1,566  $ 1,478  $ 1,157 State   Foreign    1,950  1,810  1,536 Deferred:      Federal   (121 ) State   (24 ) Foreign   (29 )    (174 ) Total $ 2,185  $ 1,935  $ 1,362 ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys combined federal, state and foreign effective tax rates for fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 were approximately 36.0% , 36.7% and 34.2% , respectively. The reconciliation of the Provision for Income Taxes at the federal statutory rate of 35% to the actual tax expense for the applicable fiscal years was as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  January 29, 2012  January 30, 2011  January 31, 2010 Income taxes at federal statutory rate $ 2,125  $ 1,846  $ 1,394 State income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit   Other, net (115 )  (42 )  (136 ) Total $ 2,185  $ 1,935  $ 1,362 ##TABLE_ENDThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011 were as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  January 29, 2012  January 30, 2011 Current:  Deferred Tax Assets:  Property and equipment $   $ Accrued self-insurance liabilities  Other accrued liabilities  Deferred compensation  Current Deferred Tax Assets  Deferred Tax Liabilities:    Accelerated inventory deduction (93 )  (106 ) Other (105 )  (114 ) Current Deferred Tax Liabilities (198 )  (220 ) Current Deferred Tax Assets, net  Noncurrent:    Deferred Tax Assets:    Accrued self-insurance liabilities  State income taxes  Capital loss carryover  Net operating losses  Foreign tax credit carryforward   Impairment of investment  Other  Valuation allowance (19 )  (66 ) Noncurrent Deferred Tax Assets  Deferred Tax Liabilities:    Property and equipment (1,192 )  (1,073 ) Goodwill and other intangibles (94 )  (95 ) Noncurrent Deferred Tax Liabilities (1,286 )  (1,168 ) Noncurrent Deferred Tax Liabilities, net (315 )  (251 ) Net Deferred Tax Assets $  $ ##TABLE_ENDCurrent deferred tax assets and current deferred tax liabilities are netted by tax jurisdiction and noncurrent deferred tax assets and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities are netted by tax jurisdiction, and are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  January 29, 2012  January 30, 2011 Other Current Assets $  $ Other Assets  Other Accrued Expenses (3 )  (5 ) Deferred Income Taxes (340 )  (272 ) Net Deferred Tax Assets $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe Company believes that the realization of the deferred tax assets is more likely than not, based upon the expectation that it will generate the necessary taxable income in future periods, and except for certain net operating losses discussed below, no valuation reserves have been provided. At January 29, 2012 , the Company had state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, expiring at various dates from 2011 to 2028 . Management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits related to the state net operating losses will be realized. However, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to utilize certain foreign net operating losses. Therefore, a valuation allowance has been provided to reduce the deferred tax asset related to foreign net operating losses to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Total valuation allowances related to net operating losses at January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011 were $19 million and $21 million , respectively. As of January 30, 2011 , the Company had a valuation allowance of $45 million related to capital loss carryforwards. During the fiscal year ended January 29, 2012 , the Company was able to utilize a portion of its capital loss carryforward. This utilization combined with other available tax planning strategies enabled the Company to release the $45 million valuation allowance associated with the capital loss carryforward. The Company had no foreign tax credit carryforwards as of January 29, 2012 and $30 million as of January 30, 2011 . During the fiscal year ended January 29, 2012 , the Company generated sufficient foreign source income to fully utilize the foreign tax credit carryforward from the prior year. The Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on approximately $2.4 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries because of its intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable; however, unrecognized foreign income tax credits would be available to reduce a portion of this liability. The Companys income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. The Companys U.S. federal and Canadian tax returns for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company's Canadian operations are currently under audit by the Canada Revenue Agency for fiscal years 2005 to 2007 . There are also ongoing U.S. state and local and other foreign audits covering tax years 2003 to 2010 . At this time, the Company does not expect the results from any income tax audit to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. The Company believes that certain adjustments under examination by the IRS and in certain states will be agreed upon within the next twelve months. The Company has classified approximately $97 million of the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits as a short-term liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Final settlement of these audit issues may result in payments that are more or less than these amounts, but the Company does not anticipate the resolution of these matters will result in a material change to its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Reconciliations of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 were as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  January 29, 2012  January 30, 2011  January 31, 2010 Unrecognized tax benefits balance at beginning of fiscal year $  $  $ Additions based on tax positions related to the current year   Additions for tax positions of prior years   Reductions for tax positions of prior years (123 )  (181 )  (28 ) Reductions due to settlements (4 )  (65 )  (94 ) Reductions due to lapse of statute of limitations (7 )  (9 )  (2 ) Unrecognized tax benefits balance at end of fiscal year $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the annual effective income tax rate on Earnings from Continuing Operations was $246 million , $298 million and $386 million as of January 29, 2012 , January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010 , respectively. Net adjustments to accruals for interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions provided income of $2 million and $32 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 , respectively, and expense of $41 million in fiscal 2009 . Total accrued interest and penalties as of January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011 were $80 million and $84 million , respectively. Interest and penalties are included in Interest Expense and SGA, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 7. EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS The Home Depot, Inc. 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (\"2005 Plan\") and The Home Depot, Inc. 1997 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (\"1997 Plan\" and collectively with the 2005 Plan, the \"Plans\") provide that incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares, performance units and deferred shares may be issued to selected associates, officers and directors of the Company. Under the 2005 Plan, the maximum number of shares of the Companys common stock authorized for issuance is 255 million shares, with any award other than a stock option reducing the number of shares available for issuance by 2.11 shares. As of January 29, 2012 , there were 162 million shares available for future grants under the 2005 Plan. No additional equity awards could be issued from the 1997 Plan after the adoption of the 2005 Plan on May 26, 2005. Under the terms of the Plans, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options must have an exercise price at or above the fair market value of the Companys stock on the date of the grant. Typically, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options vest at the rate of 25% per year commencing on the first or second anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth anniversary date of the grant. Certain of the non-qualified stock options also include performance options which vest on the later of the first anniversary date of the grant and the date the closing price of the Companys common stock has been 25% greater than the exercise price of the options for 30 consecutive trading days. Additionally, certain stock options may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The Company recognized $ 20 million , $ 20 million and $ 19 million of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively, related to stock options. Restrictions on the restricted stock issued under the Plans generally lapse according to one of the following schedules: (1) the restrictions on the restricted stock lapse over various periods up to five years, (2) the restrictions on 25% of the restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing upon the associates attainment of age 62, or (3) the restrictions on 25% of the restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing upon the earlier of the associates attainment of age 60 or the tenth anniversary of the grant date. The Company has also granted performance shares under the Plans, the payout of which is dependent on either (1) the Companys total shareholder return percentile ranking compared to the performance of individual companies included in the SP 500 index at the end of the three-year performance cycle, or (2) the Companys performance against target average return on invested capital and operating profit over a three-year performance cycle. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The fair value of the restricted stock and performance shares is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and performance shares of $ 169 million , $ 167 million and $ 158 million in fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively. In fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , there were an aggregate of 422 thousand , 479 thousand and 666 thousand deferred shares, respectively, granted under the Plans. For associates, each deferred share entitles the individual to one share of common stock to be received up to five years after the grant date of the deferred shares, subject to certain deferral rights of the associate. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to deferred shares of $ 12 million , $ 14 million and $ 14 million in fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively. As of January 29, 2012 , there were 2 million non-qualified stock options outstanding under non-qualified stock option plans that are not part of the Plans. The Company maintains two Employee Stock Purchase Plans (\"ESPPs\") (U.S. and non-U.S. plans). The plan for U.S. associates is a tax-qualified plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The non-U.S. plan is not a Section 423 plan. As of January 29, 2012 , there were 8 million shares available under the plan for U.S associates and 20 million shares available under the non-U.S. plan. The purchase price of shares under the ESPPs is equal to 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day of the purchase period, which is a six-month period ending on December 31 and June 30 of each year. During fiscal 2011 , there were 2 million shares purchased under the ESPPs at an average price of $ 33.07 . Under the outstanding ESPPs as of January 29, 2012 , employees have contributed $ 8 million to purchase shares at 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day (June 30, 2012) of the current purchase period. The Company recognized $ 14 million , $ 13 million and $ 10 million of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively, related to the ESPPs. In total, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense, including the expense of stock options, ESPP shares, restricted stock, performance shares and deferred shares, of $ 215 million , $ 214 million and $ 201 million , in fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively.

As of January 29, 2012 , there were approximately 22 million stock options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $ 40.70 , a weighted average remaining life of two years, and an intrinsic value of $ 151 million . As of January 29, 2012 , there were approximately 25 million stock options vested or expected to ultimately vest. As of January 29, 2012 , there was $ 43 million of unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years. The following table summarizes restricted stock and performance shares outstanding at January 29, 2012 , January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010 , and changes during the fiscal years ended on these dates (shares in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Number of Shares  Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at February 1, 2009 16,287  $ 34.22 Granted 8,257  23.41 Restrictions lapsed (1,686 )  34.65 Canceled (2,195 )  31.84 Outstanding at January 31, 2010 20,663  $ 30.11 Granted 5,799  32.31 Restrictions lapsed (5,276 )  32.28 Canceled (1,747 )  30.11 Outstanding at January 30, 2011 19,439  $ 30.18 Granted 5,776  35.83 Restrictions lapsed (7,937 )  31.00 Canceled (1,537 )  30.48 Outstanding at January 29, 2012 15,741  $ 31.81 ##TABLE_ENDAs of January 29, 2012 , there was $ 287 million of unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and performance shares, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years. The total fair value of restricted stock and performance shares vesting during fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was $ 290 million , $ 168 million and $ 41 million , respectively.  8. LEASES The Company leases certain retail locations, office space, warehouse and distribution space, equipment and vehicles. While most of the leases are operating leases, certain locations and equipment are leased under capital leases. As leases expire, it can be expected that, in the normal course of business, certain leases will be renewed or replaced. Certain lease agreements include escalating rents over the lease terms. The Company expenses rent on a straight-line basis over the lease term, which commences on the date the Company has the right to control the property. The cumulative expense recognized on a straight-line basis in excess of the cumulative payments is included in Other Accrued Expenses and Other Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total rent expense, net of minor sublease income, for fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was $ 823 million , $ 821 million and $ 823 million , respectively. Certain store leases also provide for contingent rent payments based on percentages of sales in excess of specified minimums. Contingent rent expense for fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was approximately $ 4 million , $ 3 million and $ 4 million , respectively. Real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and operating expenses applicable to the leased property are obligations of the Company under the lease agreements. The approximate future minimum lease payments under capital and all other leases at January 29, 2012 were as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Capital Leases  Operating Leases $  $ 2013  2014  2015  2016  Thereafter through 2097  4,577  1,259  $ 7,999 Less imputed interest   Net present value of capital lease obligations   Less current installments   Long-term capital lease obligations, excluding current installments $   ##TABLE_ENDShort-term and long-term obligations for capital leases are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in Current Installments of Long-Term Debt and Long-Term Debt, respectively. The assets under capital leases recorded in Property and Equipment, net of amortization, totaled $ 328 million and $ 336 million at January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011 , respectively.  9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company maintains active defined contribution retirement plans for its employees (the \"Benefit Plans\"). All associates satisfying certain service requirements are eligible to participate in the Benefit Plans. The Company makes cash contributions each payroll period up to specified percentages of associates contributions as approved by the Board of Directors. The Company also maintains a restoration plan to provide certain associates deferred compensation that they would have received under the Benefit Plans as a matching contribution if not for the maximum compensation limits under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company funds the restoration plan through contributions made to a grantor trust, which are then used to purchase shares of the Companys common stock in the open market. The Companys contributions to the Benefit Plans and the restoration plan were $ 171 million , $ 171 million and $ 161 million for fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively. At January 29, 2012 , the Benefit Plans and the restoration plan held a total of 14 million shares of the Companys common stock in trust for plan participants.  10. BASIC AND DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES The reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average common shares for fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  January 29, 2012  January 30, 2011  January 31, 2010 Weighted average common shares 1,562  1,648  1,683 Effect of potentially dilutive securities:      Stock Plans   Diluted weighted average common shares 1,570  1,658  1,692 ##TABLE_ENDStock plans consist of shares granted under the Companys employee stock plans as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Options to purchase 23 million , 39 million and 48 million shares of common stock at January 29, 2012 , January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010 , respectively, were excluded from the computation of Diluted Earnings per Share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties. A liabilitys fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: ##TABLE_START  Level 1  Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets  Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  Level 3  Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions ##TABLE_ENDAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The assets and liabilities of the Company that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011 were as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  Fair Value at January 29, 2012 Using  Fair Value at January 30, 2011 Using  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Derivative agreements - assets $   $  $   $   $  $  Derivative agreements - liabilities   (27 )      (40 )   Total $   $  $   $   $  $  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate exposure on long-term debt and its exposure on foreign currency fluctuations. The fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments was measured using level 2 inputs. The Companys derivative agreements are discussed further in Note 4. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The assets and liabilities of the Company that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 were as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  Fair Value Measured During Fiscal 2011 Level 3  Gains (Losses) Lease obligation costs, net $ (144 )  $ (15 ) Total for fiscal 2011   $ (15 )  Fair Value Measured During Fiscal 2010 Level 3  Gains (Losses) Lease obligation costs, net $ (158 )  $ (9 ) Guarantee of HD Supply loan $ (67 )  (51 ) Total for fiscal 2010   $ (60 )  Fair Value Measured During Fiscal 2009 Level 3  Gains (Losses) HD Supply investment $   $ (163 ) Lease obligation costs, net $ (191 )  (84 ) Total for fiscal 2009   $ (247 ) ##TABLE_ENDLease obligation costs included in the Companys Rationalization Charges were measured on a nonrecurring basis using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3), as further discussed in Note 2. The guarantee of the HD Supply loan was measured on a nonrecurring basis using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3), as further discussed in Note 3. Additionally, the Company impaired the value of its investment in HD Supply using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3), as further discussed in Note 3. Long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets were also analyzed for impairment on a nonrecurring basis using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3). Impairment charges related to long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were not material, as further discussed in Note 1 under the captions \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\" and \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" respectively. The aggregate fair value of the Companys Senior Notes, based on quoted market prices, was $ 12.1 billion and $ 9.8 billion at January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011 , respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 10.3 billion and $ 9.3 billion at January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011 , respectively. 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES At January 29, 2012 , the Company was contingently liable for approximately $413 million under outstanding letters of credit and open accounts issued for certain business transactions, including insurance programs, trade contracts and construction contracts. The Companys letters of credit are primarily performance-based and are not based on changes in variable components, a liability or an equity security of the other party. The Company is involved in litigation arising from the normal course of business. In managements opinion, this litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations.  13.

For information on key financial highlights, including historical revenues, profits and total assets, see the \"Five-Year Summary of Financial and Operating Results\" on page F-1 of this report and Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" 1 Our Business Operating Strategy  In fiscal 2012 , we continued to execute on our strategy focused on the following key initiatives: ##TABLE_START  Customer Service . Our customer service initiative is anchored on the principles of creating an emotional connection with our customers, putting customers first, taking care of our associates and simplifying the business. We underscored the importance of this initiative in fiscal 2012 by retraining all U.S. store associates on our Customers FIRST program prior to the Spring selling season. During fiscal 2012, we continued to invest in information technology and made certain strategic acquisitions to serve our customers more effectively. Through these efforts, we have continually improved our customer satisfaction survey results. We also sought to maintain competitive wages and incentive opportunities to attract, retain and motivate our associates. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Product Authority . Our product authority initiative is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value. In fiscal 2012 , we introduced a wide range of innovative new products to our professional and do-it-yourself customers, while remaining focused on offering every day values in our stores. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Disciplined Capital Allocation, Productivity and Efficiency . We have advanced this initiative through building best-in-class competitive advantages in information technology and supply chain. During fiscal 2012 , we completed the mechanization of our Rapid Deployment Center (\"RDC\") network, and we continue to focus on operating and optimizing our supply chain network. We also advanced this initiative through our continued focus on disciplined capital allocation and expense control, which drove higher returns on invested capital and allowed us to return value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Interconnected Retail . As customers increasingly expect to be able to buy how, when and where they want, we believe that providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels, with an expanded array of merchandise, will be a key enabler for future success. The interconnected retail initiative is woven throughout our business and connects our other three key initiatives. In fiscal 2012 , we launched several projects to support this initiative, starting in the first quarter with the rollout of a significant upgrade to our website, which enhanced the layout, visual appearance and responsiveness of the site. We also began construction of a new distribution center to support direct-to-customer fulfillment, with a second distribution center also under development, and we added new customer call centers in Utah and Georgia. Lastly, we introduced new programs, such as Buy Online, Return In Store (\"BORIS\") and Buy Online, Ship to Store (\"BOSS\"), to expand upon Buy Online, Pick-Up In Store (\"BOPIS\"), which we introduced in fiscal 2011. ##TABLE_END Customer Service  Our Customers . The Home Depot stores serve three primary customer groups, and we have different customer service approaches to meet their particular needs: ##TABLE_START  Do-It-Yourself (\"D-I-Y\") Customers. These customers are typically home owners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. Our associates assist these customers with specific product and installation questions both in our stores and through online resources and other media designed to provide product and project knowledge. We also offer a variety of clinics and workshops both to impart this knowledge and to build an emotional connection with our D-I-Y customers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Do-It-For-Me (\"D-I-F-M\") Customers. These customers are typically home owners who purchase materials themselves and hire third parties to complete the project or installation. Our stores offer a variety of installation services targeted at D-I-F-M customers who select and purchase products and installation of those products from us in the store. Our installation programs include products such as carpeting, flooring, cabinets, countertops and water heaters. In addition, we provide professional installation of a number of products sold through our in-home sales programs, such as roofing, siding, windows, furnaces and central air systems. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Professional Customers . These customers are primarily professional remodelers, general contractors, repairmen, small business owners and tradesmen. We offer a variety of special programs to these customers, including delivery and will-call services, dedicated staff, expanded credit programs, designated parking spaces close to store entrances and bulk pricing programs for both online and in-store purchases. We recognize the unique service needs of the professional customer and use our expertise to facilitate their buying experience. ##TABLE_END In fiscal 2012 , we undertook a number of projects and new developments to enhance our customers' shopping experiences. In addition to retraining our associates on the Customers FIRST program, we rolled out the \"First Phone Junior\" to all of our 2 stores. This version combines the communication features of a phone with the product and inventory lookup features of our First Phone, but without its complex business analytics and product ordering features. We can now spread the basic functionality and customer service benefits of the First Phone throughout the store at a lower cost. We also implemented a new \"Store to Store\" feature, which allows our associates to look up inventory in other stores, reserve the inventory and complete the sales transaction for the customer. We continued to take tasking out of the stores so that our associates can focus on assisting customers. To improve our labor efficiency, we have developed tools for automated, in-aisle inventory management to replace our former manual, paper-driven processes. As of the end of fiscal 2012 , approximately 57% of our store labor hours were dedicated to customer-facing activity, with a goal of reaching 60% by the end of fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2012, we continued to automate our special order and installation process to improve transparency and communication and to simplify the customer experience, and we launched MyInstall on our website, which allows our customers to schedule appointments and track their projects online. Our recent strategic acquisitions are also aimed at improving our customers' home improvement experiences. Red Beacon, acquired at the end of fiscal 2011, is a website that helps our D-I-F-M customers find professionals to help them complete home improvement projects. This acquisition enables us to deliver on consumer expectations by making it easier to get these projects done; it allows us to help our professional customers find jobs; and it builds relationships with our customers. We also acquired two companies that provided services to our customers  a flooring measurement company and a kitchen and bath refacing company. These acquisitions enable us to strengthen and unify our customers' home services experience under The Home Depot brand. We help our professional, D-I-Y and D-I-F-M customers finance their projects by offering private label credit products in our stores through third-party credit providers. In fiscal 2012 , our customers opened approximately 2.5 million new The Home Depot private label credit accounts, and at fiscal year end the total number of The Home Depot active account holders was approximately 10 million. Private label credit card sales accounted for approximately 22% of sales in fiscal 2012 . In addition, to improve customer convenience at the register, we completed our rollout of PayPal  as an in-store payment option and, in certain stores, implemented a program for customers to receive an electronic copy of their receipt. Our Associates. Our associates are key to our customer service initiative. We empower our associates to deliver excellent customer service through our Customers FIRST training program, and we have a number of Company-sponsored programs to recognize stores and individual associates for exceptional customer and community service. At the end of fiscal 2012 , we employed approximately 340,000 associates, of whom approximately 21,000 were salaried, with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis. To attract and retain qualified personnel, we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve. We measure associate satisfaction regularly and maintain multiple means of ensuring effective communications with our associates. We believe that our employee relations are very good. Product Authority Our Products. Our product portfolio strategy is aimed at delivering innovation, assortment and value. A typical The Home Depot store stocks approximately 30,000 to 40,000 products during the year, including both national brand name and proprietary items. We also offer over 600,000 products through our Home Depot and Home Decorators Collection websites. To enhance our merchandising capabilities, we continued to make improvements to our information technology tools in fiscal 2012 to give our merchants and suppliers greater visibility into category and item performance and to continue to increase the localized assortment in our stores. We also acquired BlackLocus, Inc., a data analytics and pricing firm, which will bring additional tools and capabilities to support our merchandising team. In fiscal 2012 , we introduced a number of innovative and distinctive products to our customers at attractive values. Examples of these new products include the second generation of EcoSmart  LED light bulbs, including the only Daylight Downlight LED sold in retail; an improved version of Behr  Premium Ultra Interior Paint  Primer in One; appliances from Electrolux  , Whirlpool  and Frigidaire  ; the second generation of Ryobi  lithium battery technology for power tools; a \"click version\" of tile with realistic wood looks from TrafficMaster  Allure; and one inch cellular window blinds under our Home Decorators Collection brand. During fiscal 2012 , we offered a number of proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments, such as Husky  hand tools and tool storage, Defiant  door locks, Everbilt  hardware fasteners, Hampton Bay  lighting and fans, Vigoro  lawn care products, RIDGID  and Ryobi  power tools and Glacier Bay  bath fixtures. We also introduced the HDX brand in February 2012, with products in the tools and hardware, storage and cleaning categories. We will continue to assess strategic alliances and relationships with suppliers and opportunities to expand the range of products available under brand names that are exclusive to The Home Depot. 3 From our Store Support Center, we maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality products directly from manufacturers around the world. Our merchant team identifies and purchases innovative products directly for our stores. Additionally, we have three sourcing offices located in the Chinese cities of Shanghai, Shenzhen and Dalian, as well as sourcing offices in Gurgaon, India; Rome, Italy; Monterrey, Mexico and Toronto, Canada. Quality Assurance . We have both quality assurance and engineering resources that are dedicated to overseeing the quality of all of our products, whether they are directly imported, locally or globally sourced or proprietary branded products. Through these programs, we have established criteria for supplier and product performance that are designed to ensure that our products comply with applicable international, federal, state and local safety, quality and performance standards. We also have a Supplier Social and Environmental Responsibility Program designed to ensure that our suppliers adhere to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility. Energy Saving Products and Programs. As an industry leader, The Home Depot is committed to doing the right thing for our customers and the environment. By providing consumers a selection of environmentally preferred products that help them save money, energy and water, we are helping to ensure a more sustainable future. Through our Eco Options  Program introduced in 2007, we have created product categories that allow consumers to easily identify products that meet specifications for energy efficiency, water conservation, healthy home, clean air and sustainable forestry. As of the end of fiscal 2012, our Eco Options  Program has certified over 5,000 products. Through this program, we sell products such as ENERGY STAR  refrigerators, dishwashers, compact fluorescent light (\"CFL\") bulbs, EcoSmart  LED light bulbs, programmable thermostats, tankless \"on demand\" water heaters and other products, enabling our customers to save on their utility bills. LED light bulbs, which use approximately 85% less energy and last up to 20 years longer than traditional incandescent bulbs, continued to be one of our fastest growing categories for the year. We estimate that in fiscal 2012, sales of ENERGY STAR  qualified products helped consumers save over $700 million in annual utility costs. We also helped our customers save water through sales of WaterSense  -labeled bath faucets, showerheads, aerators and toilets. Through the sales of these products, we estimate that we have helped consumers save over 30 billion gallons of water and over $200 million in water bills. In fiscal 2012, we made extensive updates to the Eco Options  page on our website to enable us to address growing customer demand for environmentally responsible and cost-saving products and projects. The newly enhanced site increases consumer awareness of the environmental impacts of various products, provides educational tips and identifies \"green\" projects. The site also helps consumers identify products included in the Eco Options  program, and it now includes a calculator to enable consumers to determine energy and water savings achievable by making small changes in their homes. In partnership with the U.S. Green Building Council, we launched a website in fiscal 2012 to help our customers easily identify products with potential Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (\"LEED\") point values. At the end of fiscal 2012 , we had approximately 3,500 \"LEED for Homes\" products sold in our stores and online. The website, found at www.leed.homedepot.com, is designed to simplify the complexities of building green and arm our customers with the tools needed to navigate the LEED for Homes programs by providing tips, informative videos and educational content. We continue to offer our nationwide, in-store CFL bulb recycling program launched in 2008. This service is offered to customers free of charge and is available in all U.S. stores. We also maintain an in-store rechargeable battery recycling program. Launched in 2001 and currently done in partnership with Call2Recycle, this program is also available to customers free of charge in all stores throughout the U.S. Through these recycling programs, in fiscal 2012 we helped recycle over 600,000 pounds of CFL bulbs and over 852,000 pounds of rechargeable batteries collected from our customers. In fiscal 2012 , we also recycled over 98,000 lead acid batteries collected from our customers under our lead acid battery exchange program, as well as approximately 173,000 tons of cardboard through a nationwide cardboard recycling program across our U.S. stores. 4 Net Sales of Major Product Groups . The following table shows the percentage of Net Sales of each major product group (and related services) for each of the last three fiscal years: ##TABLE_START Product Group Percentage of Net Sales for Fiscal Year Ended February 3, 2013  January 29, 2012  January 30, 2011 Plumbing, electrical and kitchen 30.8 %  30.5 %  30.0 % Hardware and seasonal 29.4  29.5  29.4 Building materials, lumber and millwork 20.6  21.1  21.7 Paint and flooring 19.2  18.9  18.9 Total 100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 % ##TABLE_ENDNet Sales outside the U.S. were $8.4 billion , $8.0 billion and $7.5 billion for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Long-lived assets outside the U.S. totaled $3.1 billion , $3.1 billion and $3.2 billion as of February 3, 2013 , January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011 , respectively. Seasonality. Our business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, and the lowest volume occurs during our fourth fiscal quarter. Fiscal 2012 included 53 weeks, rather than 52 weeks. As a result, our fourth fiscal quarter in 2012 included an extra week, which increased sales for that quarter. Competition. Our industry is highly competitive, with competition based primarily on customer service, price, store location and appearance, and quality, availability and assortment of merchandise. Although we are currently the worlds largest home improvement retailer, in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and, to a lesser extent, other retailers, as well as with installers of home improvement products. In addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers. Intellectual Property. Our business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, e-commerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business. We also maintain patent portfolios relating to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our products or business operations. Disciplined Capital Allocation, Productivity and Efficiency Logistics. Our supply chain operations are focused on creating a competitive advantage through ensuring product availability for our customers, effectively using our investment in inventory, and managing total supply chain costs. Our fiscal 2012 initiatives have been to further optimize and efficiently operate our network, build new logistics capabilities and improve our inventory management systems and processes. Our distribution strategy is to provide the optimal flow path for a given product. RDCs play a key role in optimizing our network as they allow for aggregation of product needs for multiple stores to a single purchase order and then rapid allocation and deployment of inventory to individual stores upon arrival at the RDC. This results in a simplified ordering process and improved transportation and inventory management. To enhance our RDC network, we continued adding mechanization, and at the end of fiscal 2012 , all 18 of our U.S. RDCs were mechanized. We also expanded our U.S. transload program for imported products to four facilities operated by third parties near ocean ports. Transload facilities allow us to improve our import logistics costs and inventory management by enabling imported product to flow through our RDC network. Over the past several years, we have centralized our inventory planning and replenishment function and implemented new forecasting and replenishment technology. This has helped us to improve our in-stock rates and our inventory productivity at the same time. At the end of fiscal 2012 , over 91% of our U.S. store products were ordered through central replenishment. In addition to our 18 RDCs in the U.S., at the end of fiscal 2012 , we operated 33 bulk distribution centers, which handle products distributed optimally on flat bed trucks, in the U.S. and Canada. We also operated 36 conventional distribution centers, which include stocking, direct fulfillment and specialty distribution centers, in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. We remain committed to leveraging our supply chain capabilities to fully utilize and optimize our improved logistics network. 5 Commitment to Environmentally Responsible Operations . The Home Depot is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner. This commitment impacts all areas of our business, including energy usage, supply chain, store construction and maintenance, and, as noted above under \"Energy Saving Products and Programs,\" product selection and delivery of product knowledge to our customers. In fiscal 2012 , we continued to implement strict operational standards that establish energy efficient practices in all of our U.S. facilities. These include HVAC unit temperature regulation and adherence to strict lighting schedules, which are the largest sources of energy consumption in our stores, as well as use of energy management systems in each store to monitor energy efficiency. We estimate that by implementing and utilizing these energy saving programs, we have saved over 5.5 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) since 2004, and we are on track to meet our goal of a 20% reduction in kWh per square foot in our U.S. stores by 2015. Through our supply chain efficiencies described above under \"Logistics,\" we are targeting a 20% reduction in our domestic supply chain greenhouse gas emissions from 2008 to 2015, which would equate to annual fuel savings of approximately 25 million gallons. We also continued to monitor our \"carbon footprint\" from the operation of our stores as well as from our transportation and supply chain activities. Through our energy conservation and supply chain initiatives, we reduced our absolute carbon emissions by approximately 777,000 metric tons in 2011 compared to 2010. With respect to construction of our stores, we partnered with the U.S. Green Building Council and have built seven LEED for New Construction certified or similarly certified stores. In 2012, we opened a new store in Lodi, California and used a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to help design, monitor and verify the energy savings at that store. The building is designed to consume substantially less energy than the 2007 90.1 ASHRAE standards established by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, an international society that sets forth HVAC and refrigeration standards to promote sustainability. We also implemented a rainwater reclamation pilot in 2010. As of the end of fiscal 2012, we have retrofitted 81 of our stores with reclamation tanks to collect rainwater and condensation from HVAC units and garden center roofs, which is in turn used to water plants in our outside garden centers. In September 2011, we opened a store in St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands with both ground mount and roof mount solar panel systems, and we estimate the combined total annual energy production of these systems to be over 580 megawatt hours. Our efforts have resulted in a number of environmental awards and recognitions. For example, in 2012, we were named \"Retail Partner of the Year\" by the ENERGY STAR  division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \"EPA\") for our overall excellence in energy efficiency, and we received the EPA's WaterSense  \"2012 Associate Education Excellence Award.\" We were also recognized as a \"High Performer\" by the Carbon Disclosure Project. We are strongly committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates and protecting the environment of the communities in which we do business. Our Environmental, Health  Safety (\"EHS\") function is dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of our customers and associates, with trained associates who evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a Company-wide basis. Our EHS policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of The Home Depot culture. Some common program elements include: daily store inspection checklists (by department); routine follow-up audits from our store-based safety team members and regional, district and store operations field teams; equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety; departmental merchandising safety standards; training and education programs for all associates, with varying degrees of training provided based on an associate's role and responsibilities; and awareness, communication and recognition programs designed to drive operational awareness and understanding of EHS issues. Interconnected Retail Our interconnected retail initiative supports and connects our three other key initiatives. In fiscal 2012, we focused on leveraging technology to improve our customer's retail experience and provide better access to and information about our products. As described above, these efforts included information technology solutions that take tasks out of the store and free our associates to devote more time to customer-facing activities. They also included significant website enhancements that allow customers to more easily find and purchase an expanded array of products and provide them with flexibility and convenience for their purchases (for example, through our BOPIS, BORIS, BOSS and \"Store to Store\" programs). Through our website, which can be accessed through computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices, customers can purchase products and track their installation projects through MyInstall and can connect with our associates and with one another to gain product and project knowledge in areas that are important to them. For example, in fiscal 2012, we updated the Eco Options  page on our website to provide more information for our environmentally-minded customers, and we had convenience in mind when we introduced a mobile application that allows our customers to select and purchase products quickly. Furthermore, to increase the productivity and efficiency of our associates, merchants and suppliers and ensure that 6 the right product is in the right place to meet our customers' needs, we continued to develop our distribution forecasting and replenishment system for enhanced inventory management. ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. The risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. You should read these Risk Factors in conjunction with \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item 7 and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item 8. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. Sustained uncertainty regarding current economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. Our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. Adverse conditions in or sustained uncertainty about these markets or the economy could adversely impact consumer confidence, causing our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services. Other factors  including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures, interest rate fluctuations, fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs, the availability of financing, the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit, weather, natural disasters and other conditions beyond our control  could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. We operate in markets that are highly competitive. We compete principally based on customer service, price, store location and appearance, and quality, availability and assortment of merchandise. In each market we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and, to a lesser extent, other retailers, as well as with installers of home improvement products. In addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers as our customers increasingly use computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices to shop online. Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect our prices, our margins or demand for our products and services. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through maintenance of superior customer service and customer relationships, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics, consumer preferences, expectations and needs, and unexpected weather conditions, while also managing inventory levels. Further, we have an aging store base that requires maintenance to deliver the shopping environment our customers desire. Failure to maintain attractive stores and to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs. Our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations or healthcare benefits. In addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. 7 We rely on third party suppliers. If we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our current suppliers experience financial difficulties, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. We buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by political instability, the financial instability of suppliers (particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the world), suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, supply disruptions, shipping interruptions or costs, and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. As part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. If we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation. If we do not maintain the security of customer, associate, supplier or company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. Our information systems are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Any significant compromise or breach of our data security could significantly damage our reputation, cause the disclosure of confidential customer, associate, supplier or company information, and result in significant costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits. While we have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to secured data and prevent data loss, there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. The regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. A failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to analyze, process and manage transactions and data. We also rely heavily on the integrity of this data in managing our business. We or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be expensive, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. Disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. Through our information technology developments, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and a multichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile communication devices. We use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales. We have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. Multichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments. Disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. The implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. We have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology. These initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience. The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. In addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether. 8 Disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. A disruption within our logistics or supply chain network, including damage or destruction to our distribution centers, could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to our reputation. Such a disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. If we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits and damaged reputation. We act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our D-I-F-M customers through third-party installers. As such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of our third-party installers. We have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. If we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, increased enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. Recently, there have been a large number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms, as well as increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. Changes in, increased enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements, other wage, labor or workplace regulations, the sale of some of our products, transportation, logistics, taxes, energy costs or environmental matters could increase our costs of doing business or impact our store operations. Healthcare reform under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 could adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates. If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations. Our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our U.S. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. Our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations and other legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political and economic conditions. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences, greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights, risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery law compliance, challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations. The inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. Prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. Our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if needed, could be adversely affected by the volatility in the capital markets. We obtain and manage liquidity from the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to capital markets, including our commercial paper programs supported by a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks. There is no assurance that our ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets, if needed, will not be adversely impacted due to economic conditions. New or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity and volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit, higher cost of borrowing and lack of confidence in the equity market, making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us. 9 Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive verdicts. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of managements attention and resources from other matters. ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Legal Proceedings. We are reporting the following proceedings to comply with SEC regulations, which require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental provisions if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more. As previously reported, in September 2010, the Company was contacted by district attorneys in three counties in California within the South Coast Air Quality Management District (the \"SCAQMD\") and the City of Los Angeles regarding allegations that the Company sold products in those counties with VOC (volatile organic compound) levels in excess of amounts permitted by SCAQMD rules. In June 2011, two related complaints were filed in the Superior Court of California  County of Los Angeles against the Company. The first action was brought by the SCAQMD and alleges that the Company sold products with higher-than-permitted VOC levels. This action seeks $30 million in civil penalties and injunctive relief. The second action was brought by the Los Angeles City Attorney and the district attorneys of each of Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties and alleges that the Company engaged in unfair business practices and false advertising when selling these products. This action seeks unspecified civil penalties and injunctive relief. Both actions are scheduled to be tried together as a bench trial in May 2013. In March 2013, we tentatively reached a joint settlement agreement to resolve these actions for an aggregate of $6.9 million, plus $1.1 million in fees and costs. The settlement requires the approval of the trial court.  ", "4": " Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. 13 PART II ", "5": " Item 5.

Under the Plans, participants may surrender shares as payment of applicable tax withholding on the vesting of restricted stock and deferred share awards. Participants in the Plans may also exercise stock options by surrendering shares of common stock that the participants already own as payment of the exercise price. Shares so surrendered by participants in the Plans are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the Plans and applicable award agreement and not pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) The Companys common stock repurchase program was initially announced on July 15, 2002. As of the end of fiscal 2012 , the Board had approved purchases up to $40.0 billion, of which $2.4 billion remained available at the end of fiscal 2012. In February 2013, our Board of Directors authorized a new $17.0 billion share repurchase program that replaces the previous authorization. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company paid $650 million under an Accelerated Share Repurchase (\"ASR\") agreement with a third-party financial institution and received an initial delivery of approximately 9 million shares. The transaction was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, with the Company receiving approximately 2 million additional shares to settle the agreement. The Average Price Paid Per Share was calculated with reference to the average stock price of the Company's common stock over the term of the ASR agreement. ##TABLE_END In March 2013, the Company entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.5 billion of the Companys common stock. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Shares received in connection with the ASR agreement will be reflected in the share repurchase table in future quarters. Sales of Unregistered Securities During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 , the Company issued 436 deferred stock units under The Home Depot, Inc. NonEmployee Directors Deferred Stock Compensation Plan pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). The deferred stock units were credited to the accounts of those nonemployee directors who elected to receive board retainers in the form of deferred stock units instead of cash during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 . The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 , the Company credited 24,961 deferred stock units to participant accounts under The Home Depot FutureBuilder Restoration Plan pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for involuntary, non-contributory plans.

The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to page F-1 of this report. 16 ", "7": " Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Executive Summary and Selected Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data For the fiscal year ended February 3, 2013 (\"fiscal 2012 \"), we reported Net Earnings of $ 4.5 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $ 3.00 compared to Net Earnings of $ 3.9 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $ 2.47 for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2012 (\"fiscal 2011 \"). The results for fiscal 2012 included a total charge of $145 million, net of tax, related to the closing of our remaining seven big box stores in China (\"China store closings\") in fiscal 2012, which had a negative impact of $0.10 to Diluted Earnings per Share. Excluding the charges related to the China store closings, Net Earnings were $4.7 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share were $3.10 for fiscal 2012. Net Sales increased 6.2% to $ 74.8 billion for fiscal 2012 from $ 70.4 billion for fiscal 2011 . Our comparable store sales increased 4.6% in fiscal 2012 , driven by a 2.9% increase in our comparable store average ticket and an increase in our comparable store customer transactions. Comparable store sales for our U.S. stores increased 4.9% in fiscal 2012 . Fiscal 2012 consisted of 53 weeks compared with 52 weeks for fiscal 2011. The 53 rd week added approximately $1.2 billion in Net Sales and increased Diluted Earnings per Share by approximately $0.07 for fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2012 , we continued to focus on the following four key initiatives: Customer Service  Our focus on customer service is anchored on the principles of creating an emotional connection with customers, putting customers first and simplifying the business. In fiscal 2012, we opened new customer call centers in Utah and Georgia to support our interconnected business. In addition, as a result of initiatives such as our new scheduling system for our associates and a centralized return to vendor process initiated in fiscal 2011, we now have approximately 57% of our store labor hours dedicated to customer-facing activity and expect to achieve our goal of 60% in fiscal 2013. Through these and other efforts, we continue to see our customer satisfaction survey scores improve. Product Authority  Our focus on product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is aimed at delivering product innovation, assortment and value. As part of this effort, we introduced innovative new products and great values for both our professional and D-I-Y customers in a variety of departments. Also in fiscal 2012, we expanded some of our appliance showrooms to include the Electrolux  , Whirlpool  and Frigidaire  brands. These brands were also added to our e-commerce platform in fiscal 2012. Disciplined Capital Allocation, Productivity and Efficiency  Our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through continuous operational improvement, incremental supply chain benefits, disciplined capital allocation and expense control and building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In fiscal 2012, we completed the mechanization of all of our RDCs, which we expect to further improve the cost effectiveness of this platform. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.5 times at the end of fiscal 2012 compared to 4.3 times at the end of fiscal 2011. We repurchased a total of 74 million shares for $4.0 billion through ASR agreements and the open market during fiscal 2012 . In addition, in February 2013, our Board of Directors authorized a new $17.0 billion share repurchase program that replaces the previous authorization, and announced a 34% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.39 per share. Interconnected Retail  Our focus on interconnected retail is based on building a competitive platform across all commerce channels. During fiscal 2012, we launched improvements to our website, including MyInstall, which is designed to improve transparency and communication in installation projects and to simplify the customer experience. We made several enhancements to our professional customer website, including adding an online bulk pricing program that mirrors our in-store bulk pricing program. We also introduced new programs, such as Buy Online, Return In Store (\"BORIS\") and Buy Online, Ship To Store (\"BOSS\") in fiscal 2012, to expand upon Buy Online, Pick-Up In Store (\"BOPIS\"), which we introduced in fiscal 2011. In May 2012, we acquired MeasureComp L.L.C., a flooring measurement and quote building company. MeasureComp's business was largely dedicated to The Home Depot and by in-sourcing this service under Home Depot Measurement Services, we expect to build a seamless process for our flooring customers that is designed to provide a better experience for them and a better close rate for us. In October 2012, we completed the acquisition of U.S. Home Systems, Inc. (\"USHS\"). USHS was an exclusive provider of kitchen and bath refacing products and services as well as closet and garage organizational systems to The Home Depot. This acquisition will allow us to create more effective interconnection between our stores and the USHS in-home selling platform under Home Depot Interiors, similar to what we have done with our roofing, siding and windows businesses. 17 We also completed the acquisition of BlackLocus, Inc. in December 2012. BlackLocus is a data analytics and pricing company, which will bring additional tools and capabilities to support our merchandising team. We opened twelve new stores, including nine new stores in Mexico, two new stores in the U.S. and one relocation in the U.S., and closed seven stores in China in fiscal 2012 , for a total store count of 2,256 at the end of fiscal 2012 . As of the end of fiscal 2012 , a total of 280 of our stores, or 12.4%, were located in Canada and Mexico. We generated $ 7.0 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012 . We used this cash flow to fund $4.0 billion of share repurchases, pay $ 1.7 billion of dividends and fund $ 1.3 billion in capital expenditures. Our return on invested capital (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 17.0% for fiscal 2012 compared to 14.9% for fiscal 2011 . 18 We believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations.  ##TABLE_START  % of Net Sales  % Increase (Decrease) In Dollar Amounts  Fiscal Year (1)     vs. 2011  vs. 2010 NET SALES 100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 %  6.2 %  3.5 % GROSS PROFIT 34.6  34.5  34.3  6.5  4.1 Operating Expenses:          Selling, General and Administrative 22.1  22.8  23.3  3.0  1.1 Depreciation and Amortization 2.1  2.2  2.4  (0.3 )  (2.7 ) Total Operating Expenses 24.2  25.0  25.7  2.7  0.8 OPERATING INCOME 10.4  9.5  8.6  16.6  14.1 Interest and Other (Income) Expense:          Interest and Investment Income       N/M  N/M Interest Expense 0.8  0.9  0.8  4.3  14.3 Other (0.1 )    0.1  N/M  (100.0 ) Interest and Other, net 0.7  0.8  0.8  (8.1 )  4.8 EARNINGS BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 9.7  8.6  7.8  19.0  15.1 Provision for Income Taxes 3.6  3.1  2.8  22.9  12.9 NET EARNINGS 6.1 %  5.5 %  4.9 %  16.8 %  16.3 % SELECTED SALES DATA          Number of Customer Transactions (in millions) (2) 1,364.0  1,317.5  1,305.7  3.5 %  0.9 % Average Ticket (2) $ 54.89  $ 53.28  $ 51.93  3.0 %  2.6 % Weighted Average Weekly Sales per Operating Store (in thousands) $  $  $  4.3 %  3.4 % Weighted Average Sales per Square Foot (2) $ 318.63  $ 299.00  $ 288.64  6.6 %  3.6 % Comparable Store Sales Increase (%) (3) 4.6 %  3.4 %  2.9 %  N/A  N/A ##TABLE_ENDNote: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding.   ##TABLE_START (1) Fiscal years 2012 , 2011 and 2010 refer to the fiscal years ended February 3, 2013 , January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011 , respectively.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011  Net Sales Fiscal 2012 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2011. Net Sales for fiscal 2012  increased  6.2% to $74.8 billion from $70.4 billion for fiscal 2011 . The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2012 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales and $1.2 billion of Net Sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2012. Total comparable store sales increased 4.6% for fiscal 2012 compared to an increase of 3.4% for fiscal 2011 . The positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2012 reflect a number of factors including the execution of our key initiatives and an improved U.S. housing market. All of our departments except for one posted positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2012 , and comparable store average ticket increased 2.9% for fiscal 2012. Comparable store sales for our Lumber, Flooring, Paint, Tools, Bath, Electrical, Lighting, Indoor Garden and Dcor product categories were above or at the Company average for fiscal 2012 . Comparable store sales for our Hardware, Plumbing, Outdoor Garden, Kitchen and Millwork product categories were positive for fiscal 2012 . Comparable store sales for our Building Materials product category were negative for fiscal 2012 , reflecting the impact of weather and difficult year-over-year comparisons in roofing due to storm and repair activity that drove sales in fiscal 2011. Gross Profit Gross Profit increased  6.5% to $25.8 billion for fiscal 2012 from $24.3 billion for fiscal 2011 . Gross Profit for fiscal 2012 included a $10 million charge related to the China store closings. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 34.6% for fiscal 2012 compared to 34.5% for fiscal 2011 , an increase of 10 basis points. The increase in gross profit margin in fiscal 2012 was driven primarily by a change in mix of products sold and benefits from our supply chain transformation in the U.S. Operating Expenses Selling, General and Administrative expenses (\"SGA\") increased  3.0% to $16.5 billion for fiscal 2012 from $16.0 billion for fiscal 2011 . SGA for fiscal 2012 included a $135 million charge related to the China store closings. As a percent of Net Sales, SGA was 22.1% for fiscal 2012 compared to 22.8% for fiscal 2011 . Excluding the charge related to the China store closings, SGA as a percent of Net Sales was 21.9% for fiscal 2012. The decrease in SGA as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2012 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment, strong expense controls, and lower credit card expense and casualty reserves, offset by the charge related to the China store closings. Depreciation and Amortization was $1.6 billion for both fiscal 2012 and 2011 . Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.1% for fiscal 2012 compared to 2.2% for fiscal 2011 . The decrease in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment. Operating Income Operating Income increased  16.6% to $7.8 billion for fiscal 2012 from $6.7 billion for fiscal 2011 . Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 10.4% for fiscal 2012 compared to 9.5% for fiscal 2011 . Excluding the charges related to the China store closings, Operating Income increased 18.8% to $7.9 billion for fiscal 2012. Interest and Other, net In fiscal 2012 , we recognized $545 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $593 million for fiscal 2011 . Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.7% for fiscal 2012 compared to 0.8% for fiscal 2011 . Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2012 included a $67 million pretax benefit related to the termination of our guarantee of a senior secured loan of HD Supply, Inc. (\"HD Supply Guarantee\"). Provision for Income Taxes Our combined effective income tax rate was 37.2% for fiscal 2012 compared to 36.0% for fiscal 2011 . The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 was higher than fiscal 2011 as we were unable to realize any tax benefit from the $145 million of charges related to the China store closings. Excluding the charges related to the China store closings, our combined effective income tax rate was 36.5% for fiscal 2012. Additionally, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 reflects a benefit from 20 the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards as well as certain favorable state and local tax settlements. Diluted Earnings per Share Diluted Earnings per Share were $3.00 for fiscal 2012 compared to $2.47 for fiscal 2011 . Excluding the charges related to the China store closings, Diluted Earnings per Share were $3.10 for fiscal 2012 . The 53 rd week increased Diluted Earnings per Share by approximately $0.07 for fiscal 2012. Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2012 also reflect $0.11 of benefit from repurchases of our common stock in the twelve months ended February 3, 2013 . Non-GAAP Measures To provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with non-GAAP financial measures to reflect certain adjustments. The results for fiscal 2012 included a $145 million charge, net of tax, related to the China store closings as described more fully in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no adjustments for fiscal 2011 or 2010 for events of unusual nature or frequency. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency that impact the comparability of underlying business results from period to period. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures for fiscal 2012 (amounts in millions, except per share data):  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended February 3, 2013  As Reported  Adjustments  Non-GAAP Measures  % of Net Sales Gross Profit $ 25,842  $ (10 )  $ 25,852  34.6 % Selling, General and Administrative 16,508   16,373  21.9 Operating Income 7,766  (145 )  7,911  10.6 Net Earnings 4,535  (145 )  4,680  6.3 % Diluted Earnings per Share $ 3.00  $ (0.10 )  $ 3.10  N/A ##TABLE_ENDFiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net Sales Net Sales for fiscal 2011 increased 3.5% to $70.4 billion from $68.0 billion for fiscal 2010. The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2011 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales. Total comparable store sales increased 3.4% for fiscal 2011 compared to an increase of 2.9% for fiscal 2010. The positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2011 reflect a number of factors including the execution of our key initiatives, economic growth and favorable weather conditions. We experienced positive comparable store sales in 13 of our 15 departments for fiscal 2011. Comparable store sales for our Building Materials, Paint, Hardware, Tools, Plumbing, Electrical, Kitchen and Dcor product categories were above the Company average for fiscal 2011. Comparable store sales for our Flooring, Bath, Lighting, Outdoor Garden and Indoor Garden product categories were positive for fiscal 2011. Comparable store sales for our Lumber and Millwork product categories were negative for fiscal 2011. The increase in comparable store sales also reflects a 2.6% increase in our comparable store average ticket and an 0.8% increase in our comparable store customer transactions. Gross Profit Gross Profit increased 4.1% to $24.3 billion for fiscal 2011 from $23.3 billion for fiscal 2010. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 34.5% for fiscal 2011 compared to 34.3% for fiscal 2010, an increase of 20 basis points. The increase in gross profit margin in fiscal 2011 was driven primarily by benefits arising from our supply chain transformation in the U.S., which was partially offset by higher shrink compared to fiscal 2010. Operating Expenses SGA increased 1.1% to $16.0 billion for fiscal 2011 from $15.8 billion for fiscal 2010. As a percent of Net Sales, SGA was 22.8% for fiscal 2011 compared to 23.3% for fiscal 2010. The decrease in SGA as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2011 reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment partially offset by a $32 million impairment charge for a non-core carpet cleaning and cabinet refinishing business that was sold in fiscal 2011 and $26 21 million of expenses related to natural disasters. Additionally, we experienced an expense benefit of $44 million in fiscal 2010 related to our private label credit card that did not repeat in fiscal 2011. Depreciation and Amortization was $1.6 billion for both fiscal 2011 and 2010. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.2% for fiscal 2011 compared to 2.4% for fiscal 2010. The decrease in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment and an increase in fully depreciated assets. Operating Income Operating Income increased 14.1% to $6.7 billion for fiscal 2011 from $5.8 billion for fiscal 2010. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 9.5% for fiscal 2011 compared to 8.6% for fiscal 2010. Interest and Other, net In fiscal 2011, we recognized $593 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $566 million for fiscal 2010. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.8% for both fiscal 2011 and 2010. Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2010 reflects a $51 million pretax charge related to the extension of our HD Supply Guarantee. Additionally, we experienced a $44 million benefit in fiscal 2010 that arose from favorable Internal Revenue Service guidance and a resulting reversal of an interest accrual. Provision for Income Taxes Our combined effective income tax rate decreased to 36.0% for fiscal 2011 from 36.7% for fiscal 2010. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 reflects a benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards as well as certain favorable state and local tax settlements. Diluted Earnings per Share Diluted Earnings per Share were $2.47 for fiscal 2011 compared to $2.01 for fiscal 2010. Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2011 reflect $0.13 of benefit from repurchases of our common stock in the twelve months ended January 29, 2012. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. For fiscal 2012 , Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $ 7.0 billion compared to $ 6.7 billion for fiscal 2011 . This increase reflects a $652 million increase in Net Earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense controls. In support of sales growth, we grew merchandise inventory. The increase in inventory, net of the corresponding increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offsets the increase in operating cash flows generated by Net Earnings by $330 million. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities for fiscal 2012 was $ 1.4 billion compared to $ 1.1 billion for fiscal 2011 . This change was primarily due to a $105 million increase in Payments for Businesses Acquired, net, in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, no Proceeds from Sale of Business, net, in fiscal 2012 compared to $101 million in fiscal 2011 related to the sale of a non-core carpet cleaning and cabinet refinishing business, and a $91 million increase in Capital Expenditures in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities for fiscal 2012 was $ 5.0 billion compared to $ 4.0 billion for fiscal 2011 . This change was primarily the result of how we funded our share repurchase program. In fiscal 2012, we repurchased $4.0 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock using cash flow generated from operations. In fiscal 2011, we repurchased $3.5 billion of our outstanding shares, and funded $1.0 billion of those repurchases with proceeds from long-term borrowings. We did not issue any long-term borrowings in fiscal 2012. The repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2012 were partially offset by $478 million more in proceeds from sales of common stock due to increased stock option exercises in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2012, we entered into ASR agreements with third-party financial institutions to repurchase $3.05 billion of our common stock. Under the agreements, we paid $3.05 billion to the financial institutions, using cash on hand, and received a total of 58 million shares in fiscal 2012. Also in fiscal 2012, we repurchased 16 million additional shares of our common stock for $950 million through the open market. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in fiscal 2002, we have repurchased 1.0 billion shares of our common stock for a total of $37.6 billion. In February 2013, our Board of Directors authorized a new $17.0 billion share repurchase program that replaces the previous authorization. 22 In March 2011, we issued $1.0 billion of 4.40% Senior Notes due April 1, 2021 at a discount of $2 million and $1.0 billion of 5.95% Senior Notes due April 1, 2041 at a discount of $4 million (together, the \"March 2011 issuance\"). Interest on these Senior Notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2011. The net proceeds of the March 2011 issuance were used to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock, and the balance of the net proceeds was used to repay our 5.20% Senior Notes that matured March 1, 2011 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. In connection with the March 2011 issuance, we entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock. Under the agreement, we paid $1.0 billion to the financial institution and received a total of 27 million shares in fiscal 2011. In March 2011, we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on March 1, 2016, with a notional amount of $500 million, accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on our 5.40% Senior Notes due March 1, 2016 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 300 basis points. At February 3, 2013 , the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $36 million , which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement. Also at February 3, 2013 , we had outstanding interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, that expire on December 16, 2013 with a notional amount of $1.25 billion that swap fixed rate interest on our $1.25 billion 5.25% Senior Notes due December 16, 2013 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 259 basis points. At February 3, 2013 , the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of $28 million , which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreements. We have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . In connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . As of February 3, 2013 , there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility. The credit facility expires in July 2017 and contains various restrictive covenants. As of February 3, 2013 , we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our commercial paper programs and related credit facility. We use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers and store support centers. The net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-Term Debt and Current Installments of Long-Term Debt. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with the sale of HD Supply on August 30, 2007, we guaranteed a $1.0 billion senior secured amortizing term loan of HD Supply. The original expiration date of the guarantee was August 30, 2012. In March 2010, we amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to April 1, 2014. The fair value of the guarantee at August 30, 2007 was $16 million and was recorded as a liability in Other Long-Term Liabilities. The extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to $67 million, resulting in a $51 million charge to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2010. In April 2012, the term loan guarantee was terminated. As a result, we reversed the $67 million liability related to the guarantee, resulting in a $67 million pretax benefit to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2012. As of February 3, 2013 , we had $ 2.5 billion in Cash and Cash Equivalents. We believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. In March 2013 , we entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock. Under the agreement, we will pay $1.5 billion to the financial institution, using cash on hand, and receive an initial delivery of approximately 18 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement will be determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the ASR agreement. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 23 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of February 3, 2013 (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual Obligations Total   2014-2015  2016-2017  Thereafter Total Debt (1) $ 10,256  $ 1,252  $  $ 3,001  $ 6,000 Interest Payments on Debt (2) 7,798     5,586 Capital Lease Obligations (3) 1,305     Operating Leases 8,208   1,554  1,238  4,560 Purchase Obligations (4) 2,485  1,531      Unrecognized Tax Benefits (5)        Total $ 30,157  $ 4,373  $ 3,680  $ 5,161  $ 16,943 ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1) Excludes present value of capital lease obligations, fair value of interest rate swaps and unamortized debt discounts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Interest payments are at current interest rates including the impact of active interest rate swaps. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Includes $ 813 million of imputed interest. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, software acquisitions and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) Excludes $533 million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. ##TABLE_END Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. Interest rate swap agreements are used, at times, to manage our fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. At February 3, 2013 , after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, approximately 82% of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate debt and 18% was floating-rate debt. A 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. As of February 3, 2013 we had, net of discounts, $ 10.3 billion of Senior Notes outstanding. The aggregate market value of these publicly traded Senior Notes as of February 3, 2013 was approximately $ 12.2 billion . Although we have international operating entities, our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition or results of operations. Impact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices We have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates. Revenues We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. We have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. However, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely impacted. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated 24 Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. We also record Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. Merchandise Inventories Our Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, with approximately 76% valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method. Retailers like us, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, Merchandise Inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. We evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the end of fiscal 2012 or 2011 . Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, \"swell\") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. We estimate shrink as a percent of Net Sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. The estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2012 , 2011 or 2010 . Self-Insurance We have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability (including products liability), workers compensation, employee group medical and automobile claims for which we are self-insured. Our self-insured retention or deductible, as applicable, for each claim involving general liability, workers' compensation and automobile liability is limited to $25 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively. We do not have any stop loss limits for self-insured employee group medical claims. Our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. The liabilities are reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2012 , 2011 or 2010 . Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. We believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors. Volume rebates and certain advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in SGA. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, managements decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. 25 The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, we also recognize in SGA the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of long-lived assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition and inflation. A 10% decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations. Our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations. A 10% decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10% increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations. We recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, as well as for the China store closings in fiscal 2012, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2012 , 2011 or 2010 . Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments. During fiscal 2012 , for all reporting units other than our China reporting unit, we used qualitative factors to determine that our goodwill balances for each reporting unit were not impaired. For our China reporting unit, we recorded a charge of $97 million to impair all of the goodwill associated with that reporting unit in fiscal 2012 . Impairment charges related to our remaining goodwill were not material for fiscal 2012 , 2011 or 2010 . We amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to ten years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. Impairment charges related to our other intangible assets were not material for fiscal 2012 , 2011 or 2010 . Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, \"Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income\" (\"ASU No. 2011-05\"). ASU No. 2011-05 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity and Comprehensive Income. Under ASU No. 2011-05, an entity can elect to present items of net earnings and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements. This guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter, and retrospective application was required. This guidance impacted the presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. ", "7A": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Managements Responsibility for Financial Statements The financial statements presented in this Annual Report have been prepared with integrity and objectivity and are the responsibility of the management of The Home Depot, Inc. These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and properly reflect certain estimates and judgments based upon the best available information. The financial statements of the Company have been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their accompanying report is based upon an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting solely of independent directors, meets five times a year with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and representatives of management to discuss auditing and financial reporting matters. In addition, a telephonic meeting is held prior to each quarterly earnings release. The Audit Committee retains the independent registered public accounting firm and regularly reviews the internal accounting controls, the activities of the independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors and the financial condition of the Company. Both the Companys independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2013 based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of February 3, 2013 in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2013 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included on page 28 in this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START /s/ F RANCIS S.

Tom Chief Financial Officer  Executive Vice President  Corporate Services ##TABLE_END27 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders The Home Depot, Inc.: We have audited The Home Depot, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Home Depot, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, The Home Depot, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 3, 2013 , and our report dated March 28, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/ KPMG LLP Atlanta, Georgia March 28, 2013  28 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders The Home Depot, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 3, 2013 . These Consolidated Financial Statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Consolidated Financial Statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business, Consolidation and Presentation The Home Depot, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") operate The Home Depot stores, which are full-service, warehouse-style stores averaging approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. The stores stock approximately 30,000 to 40,000 different kinds of building materials, home improvement supplies and lawn and garden products that are sold to do-it-yourself customers, do-it-for-me customers and professional customers. The Company also offers over 600,000 products through its Home Depot and Home Decorators Collection websites. At the end of fiscal 2012 , the Company was operating 2,256 The Home Depot stores, which included 1,976 stores in the United States, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam (\"U.S.\"), 180 stores in Canada and 100 stores in Mexico. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year is a 52 - or 53 -week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31 . The fiscal year ended February 3, 2013 (\"fiscal 2012 \") includes 53 weeks and fiscal years ended January 29, 2012 (\"fiscal 2011 \") and January 30, 2011 (\"fiscal 2010 \") include 52 weeks. Use of Estimates Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses in preparing these financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Receivables and Accounts Payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments. The fair value of the Companys Long-Term Debt is discussed in Note 11. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Companys cash equivalents are carried at fair market value and consist primarily of money market funds. Accounts Receivable The Company has an agreement with a third-party service provider who directly extends credit to customers, manages the Companys private label credit card program and owns the related receivables. The Company evaluated the third-party entities holding the receivables under the program and concluded that they should not be consolidated by the Company. The agreement with the third-party service provider expires in 2018 , with the Company having the option, but no obligation, to purchase the receivables at the end of the agreement. The deferred interest charges incurred by the Company for its deferred financing programs offered to its customers are included in Cost of Sales. The interchange fees charged to the Company for the customers use of the cards and any profit sharing with the third-party service provider are included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses (\"SGA\"). The sum of the three is referred to by the Company as \"the cost of credit\" of the private label credit card program. In addition, certain subsidiaries of the Company extend credit directly to customers in the ordinary course of business. The receivables due from customers were $ 42 million and $ 45 million as of February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 , respectively. The Companys valuation reserve related to accounts receivable was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of the end of fiscal 2012 or 2011 . Merchandise Inventories The majority of the Companys Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, as determined by the retail inventory method. As the inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, the inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Certain subsidiaries, including retail 35 operations in Canada and Mexico, and distribution centers, record Merchandise Inventories at the lower of cost or market, as determined by a cost method. These Merchandise Inventories represent approximately 24% of the total Merchandise Inventories balance. The Company evaluates the inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of the end of fiscal 2012 or 2011 . Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in stores, the Company accrues for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis based on historical shrink results and current trends in the business. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, \"swell\") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. The Company provides for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as for those deferred due to timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Non-U.S. subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, are not eligible to be included in the Companys consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Separate provisions for income taxes have been determined for these entities. The Company intends to reinvest substantially all of the unremitted earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries and postpone their remittance indefinitely. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes for these non-U.S. subsidiaries was recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Depreciation and Amortization The Companys Buildings, Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold Improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the original term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. The Companys Property and Equipment is depreciated using the following estimated useful lives:  ##TABLE_START  Life Buildings 5  45 years Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment 2  20 years Leasehold Improvements 5  45 years ##TABLE_ENDCapitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to six years. These costs are included in Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment as discussed further in Note 4. Certain development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred. Revenues The Company recognizes revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. The liability for sales returns is estimated based on historical return levels. When the Company receives payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets 36 until the sale or service is complete. The Company also records Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognizes this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. Gift card breakage income is recognized based upon historical redemption patterns and represents the balance of gift cards for which the Company believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote. During fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , the Company recognized $ 33 million , $ 42 million and $ 46 million , respectively, of gift card breakage income. This income is included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a reduction in SGA. Services Revenue Net Sales include services revenue generated through a variety of installation, home maintenance and professional service programs. In these programs, the customer selects and purchases material for a project, and the Company provides or arranges professional installation. These programs are offered through the Companys stores and in-home sales programs. Under certain programs, when the Company provides or arranges the installation of a project and the subcontractor provides material as part of the installation, both the material and labor are included in services revenue. The Company recognizes this revenue when the service for the customer is complete. All payments received prior to the completion of services are recorded in Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Services revenue was $ 3.2 billion , $ 2.9 billion and $ 2.7 billion for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Self-Insurance The Company is self-insured for certain losses related to general liability (including products liability), workers compensation, employee group medical and automobile claims. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date is not discounted and is recognized as a liability. The expected ultimate cost of claims is estimated based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. Prepaid Advertising Television and radio advertising production costs, along with media placement costs, are expensed when the advertisement first appears. Amounts included in Other Current Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to prepayments of production costs for print and broadcast advertising as well as sponsorship promotions were not material at the end of fiscal 2012 and 2011 . Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and certain advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense. In fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , gross advertising expense was $ 831 million , $ 846 million and $ 864 million , respectively, and is included in SGA. Specific, incremental and identifiable advertising co-op allowances were $ 85 million , $ 94 million and $ 90 million for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively, and are recorded as an offset to advertising expense in SGA. Cost of Sales Cost of Sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed, the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to the Companys stores, locations or customers, the operating cost of the Companys sourcing and distribution network and the cost of deferred interest programs offered through the Companys private label credit card program. The cost of handling and shipping merchandise from the Companys stores, locations or distribution centers to the customer is classified as SGA. The cost of shipping and handling, including internal costs and payments to third parties, classified as SGA was $ 435 million , $ 430 million and $ 410 million in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. 37 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates its long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, managements decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, the Company also recognizes in SGA the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. The Company recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, as well as for the closing of seven stores in China in fiscal 2012, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. The Company does not amortize goodwill but does assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments. During fiscal 2012 , for all reporting units other than the China reporting unit, the Company used qualitative factors to determine that its goodwill balances for each reporting unit were not impaired. For the China reporting unit, the Company recorded a charge of $97 million to impair all of the goodwill associated with that reporting unit in fiscal 2012 . Impairment charges related to the remaining goodwill were not material for fiscal 2012 , 2011 or 2010 . The Company amortizes the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to ten years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. Impairment charges related to other intangible assets were not material for fiscal 2012 , 2011 or 2010 . Stock-Based Compensation The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $ 9.86 , $ 7.42 and $ 6.70 , respectively. The fair value of these options was determined at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  February 3, 2013  January 29, 2012  January 30, 2011 Risk-free interest rate 1.2 %  2.0 %  3.1 % Assumed volatility 27.0 %  27.3 %  26.4 % Assumed dividend yield 2.3 %  2.7 %  2.9 % Assumed lives of options 5 years  5 years  5 years ##TABLE_ENDDerivatives The Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate exposure on long-term debt and its exposure on foreign currency fluctuations. The Company accounts for its derivative financial instruments in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (\"FASB ASC\") Subtopic 815-10. The fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments is discussed in Note 11. 38 Comprehensive Income Comprehensive Income includes Net Earnings adjusted for certain gains and losses that are excluded from Net Earnings under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Adjustments to Net Earnings and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income consist primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses are generally translated using average exchange rates for the period and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the day of the transaction. Segment Information The Company operates within a single reportable segment primarily within North America. Net Sales for the Company outside the U.S. were $ 8.4 billion , $ 8.0 billion and $ 7.5 billion for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Long-lived assets outside the U.S. totaled $ 3.1 billion and $ 3.1 billion as of February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 , respectively. Reclassifications Certain amounts in prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform with the presentation adopted in the current fiscal year. 2. CHINA STORE CLOSINGS In fiscal 2012, the Company closed its remaining seven big box stores in China. As a result of the closings, the Company recorded a total charge of $145 million , net of tax, in fiscal 2012. Inventory markdown costs of $10 million are included in Cost of Sales, and $135 million of costs related to the impairment of Goodwill and other assets, lease terminations, severance and other charges are included in SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 3. DEBT GUARANTEE In connection with the sale of HD Supply, Inc. on August 30, 2007 , the Company guaranteed a $ 1.0 billion senior secured amortizing term loan of HD Supply. The original expiration date of the guarantee was August 30, 2012. In March 2010, the Company amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to April 1, 2014. The fair value of the guarantee at August 30, 2007 was $16 million and was recorded as a liability of the Company in Other Long-Term Liabilities. The extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to $67 million , resulting in a $51 million charge to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2010. In April 2012 , the term loan guarantee was terminated. As a result, the Company reversed its $67 million liability related to the guarantee, resulting in a $67 million pretax benefit to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2012. 39 4. PROPERTY AND LEASES Property and equipment as of February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 consisted of the following (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  February 3, 2013  January 29, 2012 Property and Equipment, at cost:    Land $ 8,485  $ 8,480 Buildings 17,981  17,737 Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment 9,338  10,040 Leasehold Improvements 1,382  1,372 Construction in Progress  Capital Leases   38,491  38,975 Less Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization 14,422  14,527 Net Property and Equipment $ 24,069  $ 24,448 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company leases certain retail locations, office space, warehouse and distribution space, equipment and vehicles. While most of the leases are operating leases, certain locations and equipment are leased under capital leases. As leases expire, it can be expected that, in the normal course of business, certain leases will be renewed or replaced. Certain lease agreements include escalating rents over the lease terms. The Company expenses rent on a straight-line basis over the lease term, which commences on the date the Company has the right to control the property. The cumulative expense recognized on a straight-line basis in excess of the cumulative payments is included in Other Accrued Expenses and Other Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total rent expense, net of minor sublease income, for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $ 849 million , $ 823 million and $ 821 million , respectively. Certain store leases also provide for contingent rent payments based on percentages of sales in excess of specified minimums. Contingent rent expense for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was approximately $ 4 million , $ 4 million and $ 3 million , respectively. Real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and operating expenses applicable to the leased property are obligations of the Company under the lease agreements. The approximate future minimum lease payments under capital and all other leases at February 3, 2013 were as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Capital Leases Operating Leases $ $ 2014 807 99 2016 656 93 Thereafter through 2097 4,560 1,305 $ 8,208 Less imputed interest Net present value of capital lease obligations Less current installments Long-term capital lease obligations, excluding current installments $ ##TABLE_ENDShort-term and long-term obligations for capital leases are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in Current Installments of Long-Term Debt and Long-Term Debt, respectively.

DEBT The Company has commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . In connection with the programs, the Company has a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . The credit facility expires in July 2017 and contains various restrictive covenants. At February 3, 2013 , the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact the Companys liquidity or capital resources. There were no borrowings under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility in fiscal 2012 . As of January 29, 2012 , there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility. All of the Companys short-term borrowings in fiscal 2011 were under these commercial paper programs. For the fiscal year ended January 29, 2012 , the maximum amount outstanding at any month-end was $828 million , the average daily short-term borrowings were $44 million and the weighted average interest rate was 0.5% . The Companys Long-Term Debt at the end of fiscal 2012 and 2011 consisted of the following (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  February 3, 2013  January 29, 2012 5.25% Senior Notes; due December 16, 2013; interest payable semi-annually on June 16 and December 16 $ 1,286  $ 1,309 5.40% Senior Notes; due March 1, 2016; interest payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 3,058  3,069 3.95% Senior Notes; due September 15, 2020; interest payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15  4.40% Senior Notes; due April 1, 2021; interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1  5.875% Senior Notes; due December 16, 2036; interest payable semi-annually on June 16 and December 16 2,962  2,961 5.40% Senior Notes; due September 15, 2040; interest payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15  5.95% Senior Notes; due April 1, 2041; interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1  Capital Lease Obligations; payable in varying installments through January 31, 2055  Other  Total debt 10,796  10,788 Less current installments 1,321  Long-Term Debt, excluding current installments $ 9,475  $ 10,758 ##TABLE_ENDIn March 2011 , the Company entered into an interest rate swap that expires on March 1, 2016 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on the Company's 5.40% Senior Notes due March 1, 2016 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 300 basis points. At February 3, 2013 , the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $36 million , which is the estimated amount the Company would have received to settle the agreement and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Also at February 3, 2013 , the Company had outstanding interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, that expire on December 16, 2013 with a notional amount of $1.25 billion that swap fixed rate interest on the Companys $1.25 billion  5.25% Senior Notes due December 16, 2013 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 259 basis points. At February 3, 2013 , the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of $28 million , which is the estimated amount the Company would have received to settle the agreements and is included in Other Current Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. In March 2011 , the Company issued $1.0 billion of 4.40% Senior Notes due April 1, 2021 at a discount of $2 million and $1.0 billion of 5.95% Senior Notes due April 1, 2041 at a discount of $4 million (together, the \" March 2011 issuance\"). Interest on these Senior Notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2011 . The net proceeds of the March 2011 issuance were used to repurchase $1.0 billion of the Companys common stock through an Accelerated Share Repurchase (\"ASR\") agreement, and the balance of the net proceeds was used to repay the Companys 5.20% Senior Notes that matured March 1, 2011 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion . The $6 million discount 41 associated with the March 2011 issuance is being amortized over the lives of the Senior Notes using the effective interest rate method. Issuance costs were approximately $15 million and are being amortized over the lives of the Senior Notes issued in March 2011 . The Senior Notes may be redeemed by the Company at any time, in whole or in part, at the redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed, and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, if a Change in Control Triggering Event occurs, as defined by the terms of the March 2011 issuance, the 3.95% Senior Notes due September 15, 2020 and the 5.40% Senior Notes due September 15, 2040 (together the \" September 2010 issuance\"), and the 5.25% Senior Notes and the 5.875% Senior Notes (together the \"December 2006 issuance\"), holders of the March 2011 issuance, September 2010 issuance and December 2006 issuance have the right to require the Company to redeem those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The Company is generally not limited under the indenture governing the Senior Notes in its ability to incur additional indebtedness or required to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. Further, while the indenture governing the Senior Notes contains various restrictive covenants, none is expected to impact the Companys liquidity or capital resources. In fiscal 2009 and 2010 , the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of $1.0 billion to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the September 2010 issuance, accounted for as cash flow hedges. Upon the September 2010 issuance, the Company paid $193 million to settle these forward starting interest rate swap agreements. This amount, net of income taxes, is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and is being amortized to Interest Expense over the lives of the Senior Notes issued in September 2010 . At February 3, 2013 , the Company had outstanding cross currency swap agreements with a notional amount of $190 million , accounted for as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency fluctuations on certain intercompany debt. At February 3, 2013 , the approximate fair value of these agreements was a liability of $15 million , which is the estimated amount the Company would have paid to settle the agreements and is included in Other Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings is net of interest capitalized of $3 million , $3 million and $3 million in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Maturities of Long-Term Debt are $1.3 billion for fiscal 2013 , $32 million for fiscal 2014 , $29 million for fiscal 2015 , $3.1 billion for fiscal 2016 , $27 million for fiscal 2017 and $6.3 billion thereafter. 6. ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS In fiscal 2012, the Company entered into ASR agreements with third-party financial institutions to repurchase $3.05 billion of the Companys common stock. Under the agreements, the Company paid $3.05 billion to the financial institutions, using cash on hand, and received a total of 58 million shares in fiscal 2012. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of each agreement was determined with reference to the average price of the Companys common stock over the term of the applicable ASR agreement. The $3.05 billion of shares repurchased are included in Treasury Stock in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. In fiscal 2011, the Company entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.0 billion of the Companys common stock. Under the agreement, the Company paid $1.0 billion to the financial institution, using a portion of the proceeds from the March 2011 issuance, and received a total of 27 million shares in fiscal 2011. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement was determined with reference to the average price of the Companys common stock over the term of the ASR agreement. The $1.0 billion of shares repurchased are included in Treasury Stock in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. In March 2013 , the Company entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.5 billion of the Companys common stock. Under the agreement, the Company will pay $1.5 billion to the financial institution, using cash on hand, and receive an initial delivery of approximately 18 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement will be determined with reference to the average price of the Companys common stock over the term of the ASR agreement. 42 7. INCOME TAXES The components of Earnings before Provision for Income Taxes for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 were as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  February 3, 2013  January 29, 2012  January 30, 2011 United States $ 6,677  $ 5,508  $ 4,854 Foreign   Total $ 7,221  $ 6,068  $ 5,273 ##TABLE_ENDThe Provision for Income Taxes consisted of the following (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  February 3, 2013  January 29, 2012  January 30, 2011 Current:      Federal $ 2,060  $ 1,566  $ 1,478 State   Foreign    2,592  1,950  1,810 Deferred:      Federal   State   Foreign (21 )      Total $ 2,686  $ 2,185  $ 1,935 ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys combined federal, state and foreign effective tax rates for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 were approximately 37.2% , 36.0% and 36.7% , respectively. The reconciliation of the Provision for Income Taxes at the federal statutory rate of 35% to the actual tax expense for the applicable fiscal years was as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  February 3, 2013  January 29, 2012  January 30, 2011 Income taxes at federal statutory rate $ 2,527  $ 2,125  $ 1,846 State income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit   Other, net (38 )  (115 )  (42 ) Total $ 2,686  $ 2,185  $ 1,935 ##TABLE_END43 The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 were as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  February 3, 2013  January 29, 2012 Assets:    Deferred compensation $  $ Accrued self-insurance liabilities  State income taxes  Non-deductible reserves  Capital loss carryover  Net operating losses  Impairment of investment  Other  Total Deferred Tax Assets 1,575  1,639 Valuation Allowance (27 )  (19 ) Total Deferred Tax Assets after Valuation Allowance 1,548  1,620     Liabilities:    Inventory (92 )  (94 ) Property and equipment (1,194 )  (1,192 ) Goodwill and other intangibles (112 )  (97 ) Other (128 )  (101 ) Total Deferred Tax Liabilities (1,526 )  (1,484 ) Net Deferred Tax Assets $  $ ##TABLE_ENDCurrent deferred tax assets and current deferred tax liabilities are netted by tax jurisdiction and noncurrent deferred tax assets and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities are netted by tax jurisdiction, and are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  February 3, 2013  January 29, 2012 Other Current Assets $  $ Other Assets  Other Accrued Expenses (2 )  (3 ) Deferred Income Taxes (319 )  (340 ) Net Deferred Tax Assets $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe Company believes that the realization of the deferred tax assets is more likely than not, based upon the expectation that it will generate the necessary taxable income in future periods, and except for certain net operating losses discussed below, no valuation reserves have been provided. 44 At February 3, 2013 , the Company had state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, expiring at various dates from 2012 to 2029 . Management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits related to the state net operating losses will be realized. However, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to utilize certain foreign net operating losses. Therefore, a valuation allowance has been provided to reduce the deferred tax asset related to foreign net operating losses to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Total valuation allowances related to net operating losses at February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 were $27 million and $19 million , respectively. In fiscal 2011, the Company was able to utilize a portion of its capital loss carryforward. This utilization combined with other available tax planning strategies enabled the Company to release its $45 million valuation allowance associated with the capital loss carryforward. The Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on approximately $2.7 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries because of its intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable; however, unrecognized foreign income tax credits would be available to reduce a portion of this liability. The Companys income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. The Company is currently appealing certain proposed Internal Revenue Service examination adjustments for fiscal years 2005 through 2007. The Company's U.S. federal tax returns for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 are currently under examination by the IRS. There are also ongoing U.S. state and local and other foreign audits covering tax years 2005 to 2010. The Company does not expect the results from any income tax audit to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. Over the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the resolution of federal and state tax examinations could reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by $105 million . Final settlement of these audit issues may result in payments that are more or less than this amount, but the Company does not anticipate the resolution of these matters will result in a material change to its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Reconciliations of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 were as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  February 3, 2013  January 29, 2012  January 30, 2011 Unrecognized tax benefits balance at beginning of fiscal year $  $  $ Additions based on tax positions related to the current year   Additions for tax positions of prior years   Reductions for tax positions of prior years (15 )  (123 )  (181 ) Reductions due to settlements (94 )  (4 )  (65 ) Reductions due to lapse of statute of limitations (3 )  (7 )  (9 ) Unrecognized tax benefits balance at end of fiscal year $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the annual effective income tax rate on Net Earnings was $314 million , $246 million and $298 million as of February 3, 2013 , January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011 , respectively. Net adjustments to accruals for interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions resulted in expense of $15 million in fiscal 2012 and provided income of $2 million and $32 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Total accrued interest and penalties as of February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 were $97 million and $80 million , respectively. Interest and penalties are included in Interest Expense and SGA, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 45 8. EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS The Home Depot, Inc. 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (\"2005 Plan\") and The Home Depot, Inc. 1997 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (\"1997 Plan\" and collectively with the 2005 Plan, the \"Plans\") provide that incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares, performance units and deferred shares may be issued to selected associates, officers and directors of the Company. Under the 2005 Plan, the maximum number of shares of the Companys common stock authorized for issuance is 255 million shares, with any award other than a stock option or stock appreciation right reducing the number of shares available for issuance by 2.11 shares. As of February 3, 2013 , there were 154 million shares available for future grants under the 2005 Plan. No additional equity awards could be issued from the 1997 Plan after the adoption of the 2005 Plan on May 26, 2005. Under the terms of the Plans, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options must have an exercise price at or above the fair market value of the Companys stock on the date of the grant. Typically, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options vest at the rate of 25% per year commencing on the first or second anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth anniversary date of the grant. Additionally, certain stock options may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The Company recognized $ 23 million , $ 20 million and $ 20 million of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively, related to stock options. Restrictions on the restricted stock issued under the Plans generally lapse according to one of the following schedules: (1) the restrictions on the restricted stock lapse over various periods up to five years, (2) the restrictions on 25% of the restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing upon the associates attainment of age 62, or (3) the restrictions on 25% of the restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing upon the earlier of the associates attainment of age 60 or the tenth anniversary of the grant date. The Company has also granted performance shares under the Plans, the payout of which is dependent on the Companys performance against target average return on invested capital and operating profit over a three-year performance cycle. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The fair value of the restricted stock and performance shares is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and performance shares of $ 166 million , $ 169 million and $ 167 million in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. In fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , there were an aggregate of 313 thousand , 422 thousand and 479 thousand deferred shares, respectively, granted under the Plans. For associates, each deferred share entitles the individual to one share of common stock to be received up to five years after the grant date of the deferred shares, subject to certain deferral rights of the associate. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to deferred shares of $ 13 million , $ 12 million and $ 14 million in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The Company maintains two Employee Stock Purchase Plans (\"ESPPs\") (U.S. and non-U.S. plans). The plan for U.S. associates is a tax-qualified plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The non-U.S. plan is not a Section 423 plan. As of February 3, 2013 , there were 26 million shares available under the plan for U.S associates and 19 million shares available under the non-U.S. plan. The purchase price of shares under the ESPPs is equal to 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day of the purchase period, which is a six-month period ending on December 31 and June 30 of each year. During fiscal 2012 , there were 2 million shares purchased under the ESPPs at an average price of $ 48.58 . Under the outstanding ESPPs as of February 3, 2013 , employees have contributed $ 12 million to purchase shares at 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day (June 30, 2013) of the current purchase period. The Company recognized $ 16 million , $ 14 million and $ 13 million of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively, related to the ESPPs. In total, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense, including the expense of stock options, ESPP shares, restricted stock, performance shares and deferred shares, of $ 218 million , $ 215 million and $ 214 million , in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. 46 The following table summarizes stock options outstanding at February 3, 2013 , January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011 , and changes during the fiscal years ended on these dates (shares in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Number of Shares  Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at January 31, 2010 49,309  $ 36.81 Granted 3,723  32.24 Exercised (1,294 )  26.63 Canceled (7,271 )  43.95 Outstanding at January 30, 2011 44,467  $ 35.56 Granted 3,236  36.55 Exercised (6,938 )  33.25 Canceled (7,595 )  39.11 Outstanding at January 29, 2012 33,170  $ 35.32 Granted 2,376  49.89 Exercised (18,119 )  38.24 Canceled (810 )  35.27 Outstanding at February 3, 2013 16,617  $ 34.23 ##TABLE_ENDThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $ 246 million , $ 47 million and $ 9 million in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company maintains active defined contribution retirement plans for its employees (the \"Benefit Plans\"). All associates satisfying certain service requirements are eligible to participate in the Benefit Plans. The Company makes cash contributions each payroll period up to specified percentages of associates contributions as approved by the Board of Directors. The Company also maintains a restoration plan to provide certain associates deferred compensation that they would have received under the Benefit Plans as a matching contribution if not for the maximum compensation limits under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company funds the restoration plan through contributions made to a grantor trust, which are then used to purchase shares of the Companys common stock in the open market. The Companys contributions to the Benefit Plans and the restoration plan were $ 182 million , $ 171 million and $ 171 million for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. At February 3, 2013 , the Benefit Plans and the restoration plan held a total of 12 million shares of the Companys common stock in trust for plan participants.  10.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties. A liabilitys fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, rather than the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: ##TABLE_START  Level 1  Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets  Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  Level 3  Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions ##TABLE_END48 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The assets and liabilities of the Company that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 were as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  Fair Value at February 3, 2013 Using  Fair Value at January 29, 2012 Using  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Derivative agreements - assets $   $  $   $   $  $  Derivative agreements - liabilities   (15 )      (27 )   Total $   $  $   $   $  $  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate exposure on long-term debt and its exposure on foreign currency fluctuations. The fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments was measured using level 2 inputs. The Companys derivative agreements are discussed further in Note 5. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The assets and liabilities of the Company that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 were as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  Fair Value Measured During Fiscal 2012 Level 3  Gains (Losses) Lease obligation costs, net $ (137 )  $ (16 ) Total for fiscal 2012   $ (16 )  Fair Value Measured During Fiscal 2011 Level 3  Gains (Losses) Lease obligation costs, net $ (144 )  $ (15 ) Total for fiscal 2011   $ (15 )  Fair Value Measured During Fiscal 2010 Level 3  Gains (Losses) Lease obligation costs, net $ (158 )  $ (9 ) Guarantee of HD Supply loan $ (67 )  (51 ) Total for fiscal 2010   $ (60 ) ##TABLE_ENDLease obligation costs were related to certain store closings and the exit of certain businesses in fiscal 2009 and 2008. These charges were measured on a nonrecurring basis using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3). The guarantee of the HD Supply loan was measured on a nonrecurring basis using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3), as further discussed in Note 3. Upon announcement in fiscal 2012 of its intention to close seven stores in China, the Company completed an assessment on the recoverability of Goodwill for its China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was estimated using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows through unobservable inputs. As a result of this analysis, the Company recorded a $97 million impairment charge to Goodwill in fiscal 2012. See Note 2 for further discussion of the China store closings. Long-lived assets, the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets were also analyzed for impairment on a nonrecurring basis using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3). Impairment charges related to long-lived assets, the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal 2012 and 2011 were not material, as further discussed in Note 1 under the captions \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\" and \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" respectively. The aggregate fair value of the Companys Senior Notes, based on quoted market prices, was $ 12.2 billion and $ 12.1 billion at February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 , respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 10.3 billion and $ 10.3 billion at February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 , respectively. 49 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES At February 3, 2013 , the Company was contingently liable for approximately $391 million under outstanding letters of credit and open accounts issued for certain business transactions, including insurance programs, trade contracts and construction contracts. The Companys letters of credit are primarily performance-based and are not based on changes in variable components, a liability or an equity security of the other party. The Company is involved in litigation arising from the normal course of business. In managements opinion, this litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  13.

Business. Introduction The Home Depot, Inc. is the worlds largest home improvement retailer based on Net Sales for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2014 (\"fiscal 2013 \"). The Home Depot stores sell a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products and lawn and garden products and provide a number of services. The Home Depot stores average approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. As of the end of fiscal 2013 , we had 2,263 The Home Depot stores located throughout the United States including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam, Canada and Mexico. When we refer to \"The Home Depot,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\" in this report, we are referring to The Home Depot, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Home Depot, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1978. Our Store Support Center (corporate office) is located at 2455 Paces Ferry Road, N.W., Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Our telephone number is (770) 433-8211. Our internet website is www.homedepot.com. We make available on the Investor Relations section of our website, free of charge, our Annual Reports to shareholders, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such documents with, or furnishing such documents to, the SEC. We include our website addresses throughout this filing for reference only. The information contained on our websites is not incorporated by reference into this report. For information on key financial highlights, including historical revenues, profits and total assets, see the \"Five-Year Summary of Financial and Operating Results\" on page F-1 of this report and Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" 1 Our Business Operating Strategy  Over the past several years, we have maintained a consistent strategic framework comprised of three key initiatives: Customer Service; Product Authority; and Disciplined Capital Allocation, Productivity and Efficiency. We tie these together through our Interconnected Retail initiative with the objective of strengthening our performance in each element of the framework and providing a seamless customer experience, whether it begins online or in our stores. In fiscal 2013 , we continued to execute on our strategy as follows: ##TABLE_START  Customer Service . Our customer service initiative is anchored on the principles of creating an emotional connection with our customers, putting customers first, taking care of our associates and simplifying the business. One of our primary objectives has been to take tasking out of the stores so that our associates can devote more time to assisting our customers. By the end of fiscal 2013, we reached our goal of dedicating 60% of our store labor hours to customer-facing activities. We have also instituted new programs for our professional customers and new associate training specific to our \"interconnected\" customers who order product online and pick it up in our stores. Through these efforts, we exceeded our internal goal in customer satisfaction survey results, and we are continuing our efforts to improve on those results. We also sought to maintain competitive wages and incentive opportunities to attract, retain and motivate our associates. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Product Authority . Our product authority initiative is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value. In fiscal 2013 , we introduced a wide range of innovative new products to our professional, do-it-for-me and do-it-yourself customers, while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online. To maximize the productivity of our selling square footage, we invested in advanced tools to localize the selection of in-store products and identify space availability that can be shifted to other categories we want to grow. We also continued to expand our online product assortment to provide more variety for our customers. For example, in fiscal 2013, we continued our appliance showroom resets in our stores and expanded our assortment of appliances available online, resulting in double digit growth for appliances in fiscal 2013. In addition, to respond to increasing customer demand for personalization, we introduced customizable products such as patio sets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Disciplined Capital Allocation, Productivity and Efficiency . We have advanced this initiative through building best-in-class competitive advantages in our information technology and supply chain to better ensure product availability to our customers while managing our costs. During fiscal 2013 , we continued to focus on optimizing our supply chain network and improving our inventory, transportation and distribution productivity. This effort included enhancements to our forecasting and replenishment systems, which help our business react to and recover from sales spikes while keeping inventory under control. We also invested in our information technology to support our interconnected retail initiative. In addition to making disciplined decisions about capital allocation, we maintained our focus on expense control, which drove higher returns on invested capital and allowed us to return value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as discussed in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Interconnected Retail . As customers increasingly expect to be able to buy how, when and where they want, we believe that providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels, with an expanded array of merchandise, will be a key enabler for future success. The interconnected retail initiative is woven throughout our business and connects our other three key initiatives. At the core of this initiative is using our almost 2,000 U.S. stores as a network of convenient locations for our customers who shop online. In fiscal 2013 , we completed our rollout of Buy Online, Ship to Store (\"BOSS\") and Buy Online, Return In Store (\"BORIS\"), which complement Buy Online, Pick-up In Store (\"BOPIS\"), introduced in fiscal 2011. We also began the groundwork for Buy Online, Deliver From Store (\"BODFS\"), which will give us the capability to deliver orders placed online from our stores to the customer's home or job site. We expect to launch BODFS in fiscal 2014. To further support direct-to-customer delivery, in February 2014, we opened a new direct fulfillment center in Georgia, with two additional facilities expected to be built by the end of 2015. For our user experience online, we continued to enhance our website and mobile sites by improving our search functionality, making our product content more visual and engaging and simplifying the check-out process. For fiscal 2013, sales from our online channels increased over 50% compared to fiscal 2012. We also enhanced our online experience by acquiring Blinds.com, the market leader in online sales of window coverings, in January 2014. ##TABLE_END 2 Customer Service  Our Customers . The Home Depot stores serve three primary customer groups, and we have different customer service approaches to meet their particular needs: ##TABLE_START  Do-It-Yourself (\"DIY\") Customers. These customers are typically home owners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. Our associates assist these customers with specific product and installation questions both in our stores and through online resources and other media designed to provide product and project knowledge. We also offer a variety of clinics and workshops both to impart this knowledge and to build an emotional connection with our DIY customers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Do-It-For-Me (\"DIFM\") Customers. These customers are typically home owners who purchase materials and hire third parties to complete the project or installation. Our stores offer a variety of installation services targeted at DIFM customers who purchase products and installation of those products from us in our stores, online or in their homes through in-home consultations. Our installation programs include many categories, such as flooring, cabinets, countertops, water heaters, and sheds. In addition, we provide professional installation in a number of categories sold through our in-home sales programs, such as roofing, siding, windows, kitchen and bath refacing, furnaces, and central air systems. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Professional Customers . These customers are primarily professional remodelers, general contractors, repairmen, small business owners and tradesmen. We recognize the unique service needs of the professional customer and use our expertise to facilitate their buying experience. We offer a variety of special programs to these customers, including delivery and will-call services, dedicated staff, expanded credit programs, designated parking spaces close to store entrances and bulk pricing programs for both online and in-store purchases. In fiscal 2013, we launched a mobile app for our professional customers, which enables them to see multiple stores' inventory at one time, provides them with direct access to our pro desks, and gives them other functionality to help them better manage their businesses. We also introduced Pro Xtra, a new loyalty program that provides our professional customers with discounts on useful business services, exclusive product offers and a purchase tracking tool to enable receipt lookup online and job tracking of purchases across all forms of payment. ##TABLE_END In fiscal 2013 , we undertook a number of projects and new developments to enhance our customers' shopping experiences. Our goal is to remove complexity from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers. As noted above, as of the end of fiscal 2013 , approximately 60% of our store labor hours were dedicated to customer-facing activity. We also rolled out a new initiative in fiscal 2013 called Project Simple to reduce unnecessary store reports, store-based emails and meetings that kept store management from selling activities. To assist our BOPIS and BOSS customers, we rolled out a new customer service training for our associates called Customer FIRST for the Interconnected Customer, which stresses the importance of quick customer pickup of merchandise. To support this initiative, we enabled our First Phone mobile handheld devices to complete BOPIS and BOSS transactions from anywhere in the store. Now our online customers can come into the store, retrieve their merchandise and complete the transaction without having to stand in line at the cash register. During fiscal 2013, we also revamped our freight flow process to improve our in-stock rate and accuracy of our on-hand inventory count while also shifting more of the stocking activity to take place when stores are closed so as not to interfere with our customers' shopping experience. In fiscal 2013, we continued to automate our special order and installation process to improve transparency and communication and to simplify the customer experience. In addition, we are rolling out Install to Go so that our third-party installers can accept payment on their mobile devices from our DIFM customers, an added convenience for both our installers and customers. We also completed the integration of two companies acquired in fiscal 2012 that provide services to our customers  a flooring measurement company and a kitchen and bath refacing company. These acquisitions enable us to increase our control over the installation process and serve as a single point of contact for our customers, which in turn strengthens and unifies our customers' home services experience under The Home Depot brand. We help our professional, DIY and DIFM customers finance their projects by offering private label credit products in our stores through third-party credit providers. In fiscal 2013 , our customers opened approximately 2.8 million new The Home Depot private label credit accounts, and at fiscal year end the total number of The Home Depot active account holders was approximately 11 million. Private label credit card sales accounted for approximately 23% of sales in fiscal 2013 . Our Associates. Our associates are key to our customer service initiative. We empower our associates to deliver excellent customer service through our Customer FIRST training program, and we have a number of programs to recognize stores and individual associates for exceptional customer and community service. At the end of fiscal 2013 , we employed approximately 365,000 associates, of whom approximately 22,000 were salaried, with the remainder compensated on an hourly or 3 temporary basis. To attract and retain qualified personnel, we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve. We measure associate satisfaction regularly, and we believe that our employee relations are very good. Product Authority Our Products. Our product portfolio strategy is aimed at delivering innovation, assortment and value. A typical The Home Depot store stocks approximately 30,000 to 40,000 products during the year, including both national brand name and proprietary items. We also offer over 700,000 products through our Home Depot and Home Decorators Collection websites. To enhance our merchandising capabilities, we continued to make improvements to our information technology tools in fiscal 2013 to give our merchants and suppliers greater visibility into category and item performance and to increase the localization of our stores  both in terms of product assortment and space allocation. We also continued to use the resources of BlackLocus, Inc., a data analytics and pricing firm we acquired in fiscal 2012, to help us make focused merchandising decisions based on complex sets of large amounts of data. In fiscal 2013 , we introduced a number of innovative and distinctive products to our customers at attractive values. Examples of these new products include LED light bulbs from Cree  ; Soft Spring Carpet from Mohawk  ; customizable patio furniture from Plantation Patterns Patio  ; wifi-enabled thermostats from Nest  and Honeywell  ; Behr Marquee  exterior paint with a one coat coverage guarantee and ability to repel rain within 60 minutes of application; and Double Duty Sawzall Blades from Milwaukee  . During fiscal 2013 , we offered a number of proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments, such as Husky  hand tools and tool storage; Defiant  door locks; Everbilt  hardware fasteners; Hampton Bay  lighting and fans; Vigoro  lawn care products; RIDGID  and Ryobi  power tools; Glacier Bay  bath fixtures; HDX  tools, hardware, storage and cleaning products; and CE Tech  audio-visual accessories. We will continue to assess strategic alliances and relationships with suppliers and opportunities to expand the range of products available under brand names that are exclusive to The Home Depot. We maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality and innovative products directly from manufacturers around the world. In fiscal 2013, in addition to our sourcing operations at our Store Support Center in Atlanta, Georgia, we maintained three sourcing offices located in the Chinese cities of Shanghai, Shenzhen and Dalian, as well as sourcing offices in Gurgaon, India; Rome, Italy; Monterrey, Mexico and Toronto, Canada. The percentage of Net Sales of each of our major product categories (and related services) for each of the last three fiscal years is presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Net Sales outside the U.S. were $8.5 billion , $8.4 billion and $8.0 billion for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Long-lived assets outside the U.S. totaled $2.9 billion , $3.1 billion and $3.1 billion as of February 2, 2014 , February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 , respectively. Quality Assurance . We have both quality assurance and engineering resources that are dedicated to overseeing the quality of all of our products, whether they are directly imported, locally or globally sourced or proprietary branded products. Through these programs, we have established criteria for supplier and product performance that are designed to ensure that our products comply with applicable international, federal, state and local safety, quality and performance standards. We also have a Supplier Social and Environmental Responsibility Program designed to ensure that our suppliers adhere to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility. Energy Saving Products and Programs. Over 20 years ago, The Home Depot made a commitment to sustainability and doing the right thing for our shareholders, our customers and the environment. We support sustainability on a daily basis by providing consumers with a selection of environmentally preferred products that help them save money, energy and water. Through our Eco Options  Program introduced in 2007, we have created product categories that allow consumers to easily identify products that meet specifications for energy efficiency, water conservation, healthy home, clean air and sustainable forestry. As of the end of fiscal 2013, our Eco Options  Program included over 7,700 products. Through this program, we sell products such as ENERGY STAR  certified appliances, compact fluorescent light (\"CFL\") and LED light bulbs, wifi-programmable thermostats, tankless water heaters and other products, enabling our customers to save on their utility bills. We estimate that in fiscal 2013 we have helped consumers save nearly $770 million in electricity costs through sales of ENERGY STAR  certified products as well as over 42 billion gallons of water and over $350 million in water bills through the sales of WaterSense  -labeled bath faucets, showerheads, aerators, toilets and irrigation controllers. Additionally, by converting all of our consumer interior paints to \"Low VOC\" or \"Zero VOC,\" we eliminated over 27 million pounds of volatile organic compound emissions in fiscal 2013. 4 We also continue to use the Eco Options  page on our website to reach consumers interested in environmentally responsible and cost-saving products and projects. The site provides consumers with information on the benefits of environmentally-preferred Eco Options  products through \"green\" blogs, articles and projects, featured Eco Options  products and energy and water savings calculators to help consumers estimate potential savings by switching out their older, less efficient products with energy- and water-saving models. We continue to offer our nationwide, in-store CFL bulb recycling program launched in 2008. This service is offered to customers free of charge and is available in all U.S. stores. We also maintain an in-store rechargeable battery recycling program. Launched in 2001 and currently done in partnership with Call2Recycle, this program is also available to customers free of charge in all stores throughout the U.S. Through these recycling programs, in fiscal 2013 we helped recycle over 600,000 pounds of CFL bulbs and over 940,000 pounds of rechargeable batteries collected from our customers. In fiscal 2013 , we also recycled over 94,000 lead acid batteries collected from our customers under our lead acid battery exchange program, as well as approximately 186,000 tons of cardboard through a nationwide cardboard recycling program across our U.S. stores. Seasonality. Our business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, and the lowest volume occurs during our fourth fiscal quarter. Competition. Our industry is highly competitive, with competition based primarily on customer service, price, store location and appearance, and quality, availability and assortment of merchandise. Although we are currently the worlds largest home improvement retailer, in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and, to a lesser extent, other retailers, as well as with installers of home improvement products. In addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers as our customers increasingly use computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products. Intellectual Property. Our business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, e-commerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business, including our expanding proprietary brands such as HDX  , Husky  , Hampton Bay  , Home Decorators Collection  , Glacier Bay  and Vigoro  . We also maintain patent portfolios relating to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our products or business operations. Disciplined Capital Allocation, Productivity and Efficiency Logistics. Our supply chain operations are focused on creating a competitive advantage through ensuring product availability for our customers, effectively using our investment in inventory, and managing total supply chain costs. Our fiscal 2013 initiatives have been to further optimize and efficiently operate our network, build new logistics capabilities and improve our inventory management systems and processes by investing in information technology. Our distribution strategy is to provide the optimal flow path for a given product. Rapid Deployment Centers (\"RDCs\") play a key role in optimizing our network as they allow for aggregation of product needs for multiple stores to a single purchase order and then rapid allocation and deployment of inventory to individual stores upon arrival at the RDC. This results in a simplified ordering process and improved transportation and inventory management. We have 18 fully mechanized RDCs in the U.S., and we opened our first RDC in Canada in early 2014, with a second Canadian RDC under development. We also continued our U.S. transload program for imported products in four facilities operated by third parties near ocean ports. Transload facilities allow us to improve our import logistics costs and inventory management by postponing final inventory deployment decisions until product arrives at destination ports. Over the past several years, we have centralized our inventory planning and replenishment function and implemented new forecasting and replenishment technology. This has helped us to improve our in-stock rates and our inventory productivity at the same time. At the end of fiscal 2013 , over 95% of our U.S. store products were ordered through central inventory management. In addition to our 18 RDCs in the U.S., at the end of fiscal 2013 , we operated 34 bulk distribution centers, which handle products distributed optimally on flat bed trucks, in the U.S. and Canada. We also operated 36 conventional distribution centers, which include stocking, direct fulfillment and specialty distribution centers, in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In 5 February 2014, to support direct-to-customer delivery, we opened a new direct fulfillment center in the U.S., and we plan to add two additional facilities by the end of 2015. We expect these facilities to provide us the ability to deliver 90% of our customers' parcel orders in the U.S. within two days. We remain committed to leveraging our supply chain capabilities to fully utilize and optimize our improved logistics network. Commitment to Environmentally Responsible Operations . The Home Depot is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner. This commitment impacts all areas of our business, including energy usage, supply chain, store construction and maintenance, and, as noted above under \"Energy Saving Products and Programs,\" product selection and delivery of product knowledge to our customers. In fiscal 2013 , our energy management team continued to implement strict operational standards that establish energy efficient practices in all of our U.S. facilities. These include HVAC unit temperature regulation and adherence to strict lighting schedules, which are the largest sources of energy consumption in our stores, as well as use of energy management systems in each store to monitor energy efficiency. We estimate that by implementing and utilizing these energy saving programs, we have saved almost 7.0 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) since 2004. That year, we set a goal to reduce our kWh per square foot in our U.S. stores by 20% by 2015, and we met that goal in fiscal 2013, well in advance of our targeted date. Through our supply chain efficiencies described above under \"Logistics,\" we are targeting a 20% reduction in our domestic supply chain greenhouse gas emissions from 2008 to 2015, which would equate to annual fuel savings of approximately 25 million gallons. We also continued to monitor our \"carbon footprint\" from the operation of our stores as well as from our transportation and supply chain activities. Through our energy conservation and supply chain initiatives, we estimate that we reduced our absolute carbon emissions by approximately 216,000 metric tons in 2012 compared to 2011. With respect to construction of our stores, we partnered with the U.S. Green Building Council and, as of the end of fiscal 2013, have built eight LEED for New Construction certified or similarly certified stores. In 2012, we opened a new store in Lodi, California and used a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to help design, monitor and verify the energy savings at that store. The building is designed to consume substantially less energy than the 2007 90.1 ASHRAE standards established by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, an international society that sets forth HVAC and refrigeration standards to promote sustainability. We also implemented a rainwater reclamation project in 2010. As of the end of fiscal 2013, we had retrofitted 122 of our stores with reclamation tanks to collect rainwater and condensation from HVAC units and garden center roofs, which is in turn used to water plants in our outside garden centers. We estimate our annual water savings from these units to be approximately 500,000 gallons per retrofitted store in fiscal 2013. Our efforts have resulted in a number of environmental awards and recognitions. For example, in 2013, we were named \"Retail Partner of the Year\" by both the ENERGY STAR  division and WaterSense  division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for our overall excellence in energy efficiency and water efficiency. We also scored 99 out of 100 on the Carbon Disclosure Project Climate Disclosure Index, placing us among the highest scoring companies in the Index and at the top of our sector. We are strongly committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates and protecting the environment of the communities in which we do business. Our Environmental, Health  Safety (\"EHS\") function is dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of our customers and associates, with trained associates who evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a Company-wide basis. Our EHS policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of The Home Depot culture. Some common program elements include: daily store inspection checklists (by department); routine follow-up audits from our store-based safety team members and regional, district and store operations field teams; equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety; departmental merchandising safety standards; training and education programs for all associates, with varying degrees of training provided based on an associate's role and responsibilities; and awareness, communication and recognition programs designed to drive operational awareness and understanding of EHS issues. Interconnected Retail Our interconnected retail initiative supports and connects our three other key initiatives, and it is growing in importance as the line between online and in-store shopping continues to blur. Over 30% of our online orders are picked up in a store, and many of our customers research products online and then go into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate before making the purchase. While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews, compare prices or view our extended assortment, and over 10% of our online orders are created in-store with a store associate assisting the customer. Providing a seamless multichannel retail experience is key to helping our customers buy when, how 6 and where they want. Throughout fiscal 2013, we continued to invest in our website to allow customers to more easily find and purchase an expanded array of products and provide them with flexibility and convenience for their purchases (for example, through our BOPIS, BORIS and BOSS programs). Through our website, which can be accessed through computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices, customers can share reviews, purchase products, track their installation projects and connect with our associates to gain product and project knowledge. To increase the productivity and efficiency of our associates, merchants and suppliers and ensure that the right product is in the right place to meet our customers' needs, we also continued to invest in the development of our distribution forecasting and replenishment system for enhanced inventory management. ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. The risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. You should read these Risk Factors in conjunction with \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item 7 and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item 8. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. We operate in markets that are highly competitive. We compete principally based on customer service, price, store location and appearance, and quality, availability and assortment of merchandise. In each market we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and, to a lesser extent, other retailers, as well as with installers of home improvement products. In addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers as our customers increasingly use computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products in real time. Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect our prices, our margins or demand for our products and services. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through maintenance of superior customer service and customer relationships, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics, consumer preferences, expectations and needs, and unexpected weather conditions, while also managing inventory levels. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. Recovery in the housing and home improvement market puts further pressure on our ability to meet customer needs and expectations and maintain high service levels. In addition, we must continually anticipate and adapt to the increasing use of technology and mobile devices by our customers in the purchasing process. Customers are able to use technology to rapidly compare products and prices and use social media to provide feedback and information about our Company and products in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. To the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media, it may impact our brand and reputation. Further, we have an aging store base that requires maintenance to deliver the shopping environment our customers desire. Failure to maintain our stores and an effective online presence and to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs. Our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations or healthcare benefits. In addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. 7 These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. Uncertainty regarding economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. Our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. Adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets or the economy could adversely impact consumer confidence, causing our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services. Other factors beyond our control  including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures, interest rate fluctuations, fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs, the availability of financing, the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit, weather, natural disasters and other conditions beyond our control  could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. If we do not maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier or Company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. Our business involves the storage and transmission of customers' personal information, consumer preferences and credit card information, as well as confidential information about our associates, our suppliers and our Company. Our information systems are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Any significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of associate or customer data, could significantly damage our reputation, cause the disclosure of confidential customer, associate, supplier or Company information, and result in significant costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits. While we have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss, there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuse of the data. The regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. A failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to analyze, process and manage transactions and data. We also rely heavily on the integrity of this data in managing our business. In order for these systems and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must periodically maintain and update them. We or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. Disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. Through our information technology developments, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and a multichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices. We use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales. We have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. Multichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments. Disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. We rely on third-party suppliers. If we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our current suppliers experience financial difficulties, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. We buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by political instability, the financial instability of suppliers (particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the world), suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, supply disruptions, weather conditions, natural disasters, shipping interruptions or costs, and other factors beyond our control. 8 If we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. As part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. We have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. Our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our business. If we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results. The implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. We have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology. These initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience. The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. In addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. A disruption within our logistics or supply chain network, including damage or destruction to our distribution centers or weather-related events, could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation. Such a disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. If we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits and damaged reputation. We act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our DIFM customers through third-party installers. As such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of our third-party installers. We have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. If we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, increased enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. Recently, there have been a large number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms, as well as increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. Changes in, increased enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements, other wage, labor or workplace regulations, the sale of some of our products, transportation, logistics, supply chain transparency, taxes, energy costs or environmental matters could increase our costs of doing business or impact our store operations. Healthcare reform under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 could adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates. If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations. Our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our U.S. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. Our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations and other legal and regulatory constraints, as 9 well as political and economic conditions. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences, greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights, risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery law compliance, challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations. The inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. Prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. Our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if needed, could be adversely affected by the volatility in the capital markets. We obtain and manage liquidity from the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to capital markets, including our commercial paper programs supported by a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks. There is no assurance that our ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets, if needed, will not be adversely impacted due to economic conditions. New or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity and volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit, higher cost of borrowing and lack of confidence in the equity market, making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive verdicts. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of managements attention and resources from other matters. ", "1B": " Item 1B.

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Shares received in connection with the ASR agreement will be reflected in the share repurchase table in future quarters. Sales of Unregistered Securities During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 , the Company issued 485 deferred stock units under The Home Depot, Inc. Non-Employee Directors' Deferred Stock Compensation Plan pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") and Rule 506 of the SEC's Regulation D thereunder. The deferred stock units were credited to the accounts of those non-employee directors who elected to receive board retainers in the form of deferred stock units instead of cash during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 . The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 , the Company credited 32,531 deferred stock units to participant accounts under The Home Depot FutureBuilder Restoration Plan pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for involuntary, non-contributory plans. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan.  ", "6": " Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to page F-1 of this report. 16 ", "7": " Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Executive Summary and Selected Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data For the fiscal year ended February 2, 2014 (\"fiscal 2013 \"), we reported Net Earnings of $ 5.4 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $ 3.76 compared to Net Earnings of $ 4.5 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $ 3.00 for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2013 (\"fiscal 2012 \"). The results for fiscal 2012 included a total charge of $145 million, net of tax, related to the closing of our remaining seven big box stores in China (\"China store closings\") in fiscal 2012, which had a negative impact of $0.10 to Diluted Earnings per Share. Excluding the charge related to the China store closings, Net Earnings were $4.7 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share were $3.10 for fiscal 2012. Net Sales increased 5.4% to $ 78.8 billion for fiscal 2013 from $ 74.8 billion for fiscal 2012 . Our comparable store sales increased 6.8% in fiscal 2013 , driven by increased comparable store customer transactions and comparable store average ticket. Comparable store sales for our U.S. stores increased 7.5% in fiscal 2013 . Fiscal 2013 consisted of 52 weeks compared with 53 weeks for fiscal 2012. The 53 rd week added approximately $1.2 billion in Net Sales and increased Diluted Earnings per Share by approximately $0.07 for fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2013 , we continued to focus on the following key initiatives: Customer Service  Our focus on customer service is anchored on the principles of creating an emotional connection with customers, putting customers first, taking care of our associates and simplifying the business. In fiscal 2013 , we met our goal of dedicating 60% of store labor hours to customer-facing activity, and we enhanced our Customer FIRST training for associates to incorporate the interconnected retail experience. We also expanded our FIRST phones' functionality to process Buy Online, Pick-up In Store (\"BOPIS\") and Buy Online, Ship to Store (\"BOSS\") orders, allowing our associates to close these types of transactions immediately from wherever they are in the store. Also in fiscal 2013, we introduced Pro Xtra, a new loyalty program that provides our professional customers with discounts on useful business services, exclusive product offers and streamlined payment and receipt tracking tools. Product Authority  Our focus on product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is aimed at delivering product innovation, assortment and value. As part of this effort, we introduced innovative new products and great values for our professional, do-it-for-me and do-it-yourself customers in a variety of departments. Also in fiscal 2013, we continued our appliance showroom resets and expanded our assortment of appliances available online, resulting in double digit growth for appliances for fiscal 2013. Disciplined Capital Allocation, Productivity and Efficiency  Our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through continuous operational improvement in the stores and our supply chain, disciplined capital allocation and building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In fiscal 2013 , we continued to make improvements to our forecasting and replenishment systems, helping our business to react to and recover from sales spikes while keeping inventory under control. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.6 times at the end of fiscal 2013 compared to 4.5 times at the end of fiscal 2012. We repurchased a total of 111 million shares for $8.5 billion through Accelerated Share Repurchase agreements and the open market during fiscal 2013 . In addition, in February 2014, we announced a 21% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.47 per share. Interconnected Retail  Our focus on interconnected retail, which connects our other three key initiatives, is based on building a competitive and seamless platform across all commerce channels. In fiscal 2013, we continued to enhance our website and mobile experience resulting in improved customer satisfaction scores and online sales conversion rates. Sales from our online channels increased over 50% for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 and now represent approximately 3.5% of our total Net Sales. We have also begun the development of three new direct fulfillment centers, the first of which opened in February 2014. Each facility will have the capacity to hold approximately 100,000 product offerings available to be shipped directly to customers, along with the capability to ship most orders the same day they are received. In January 2014, we acquired Blinds.com, an online seller of window coverings. We believe that this acquisition will allow us to offer customers a compelling shopping, sales and service experience for online window coverings purchases and help us to develop best-in-class capabilities for selling customizable and configurable products online. In fiscal 2013 , we opened eight new stores, including six new stores in Mexico and two new stores in the U.S., and closed one store in the U.S., for a total store count of 2,263 at the end of fiscal 2013 . As of the end of fiscal 2013 , a total of 286 of our stores, or 12.6% , were located in Canada and Mexico. 17 We generated $7.6 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2013 . This cash flow, along with $4.0 billion of incremental long-term debt issued in fiscal 2013 and cash on hand, was used to fund $8.5 billion of share repurchases, pay $2.2 billion of dividends and fund $1.4 billion in capital expenditures. Our return on invested capital (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 20.9% for fiscal 2013 compared to 17.0% for fiscal 2012 . 18 We believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations.  ##TABLE_START  % of Net Sales  % Increase (Decrease) In Dollar Amounts  Fiscal Year (1)     vs. 2012  2012 vs. 2011 NET SALES 100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 %  5.4 %  6.2 % GROSS PROFIT 34.8  34.6  34.5  6.0  6.5 Operating Expenses:          Selling, General and Administrative 21.1  22.1  22.8  0.5  3.0 Depreciation and Amortization 2.1  2.1  2.2  3.8  (0.3 ) Total Operating Expenses 23.1  24.2  25.0  0.8  2.7 OPERATING INCOME 11.6  10.4  9.5  18.0  16.6 Interest and Other (Income) Expense:          Interest and Investment Income       (40.0 )  53.8 Interest Expense 0.9  0.8  0.9  12.5  4.3 Other   (0.1 )    (100.0 )  N/A Interest and Other, net 0.9  0.7  0.8  28.3  (8.1 ) EARNINGS BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 10.7  9.7  8.6  17.3  19.0 Provision for Income Taxes 3.9  3.6  3.1  14.7  22.9 NET EARNINGS 6.8 %  6.1 %  5.5 %  18.7 %  16.8 % SELECTED SALES DATA          Number of Customer Transactions (in millions) (2) 1,390.6  1,364.0  1,317.5  1.9 %  3.5 % Average Ticket (2) $ 56.78  $ 54.89  $ 53.28  3.4 %  3.0 % Sales per Square Foot (2) $ 334.35  $ 318.63  $ 299.00  4.9 %  6.6 % Comparable Store Sales Increase (%) (3) 6.8 %  4.6 %  3.4 %  N/A  N/A Online Sales (% of Net Sales) (4) 3.5 %  2.4 %  1.8 %  52.6 %  39.3 % ##TABLE_ENDNote: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding.   ##TABLE_START (1) Fiscal years 2013 , 2012 and 2011 refer to the fiscal years ended February 2, 2014 , February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 , respectively.

Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  Net Sales Fiscal 2013 consisted of 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2012. Net Sales for fiscal 2013  increased  5.4% to $78.8 billion from $74.8 billion for fiscal 2012 . The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2013 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2013, partially offset by $1.2 billion of Net Sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2012. Total comparable store sales increased 6.8% for fiscal 2013 compared to an increase of 4.6% for fiscal 2012 . The positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2013 reflect a number of factors, including the execution of our key initiatives, continued strength in our core categories and an improved U.S. housing market. All of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2013 . Comparable store sales for our Kitchen, Electrical, Lumber, Plumbing, Lighting, Bath and Indoor Garden product categories were above or at the Company average for fiscal 2013 . Comparable store sales for our Tools, Paint, Flooring, Dcor, Hardware, Outdoor Garden, Millwork and Building Materials product categories were positive for fiscal 2013 . Further, our comparable store customer transactions increased approximately 3.4% for fiscal 2013 and comparable store average ticket increased approximately 3.3% for fiscal 2013 due in part to strong sales in our appliance business and continued recovery in sales to our professional customers. Gross Profit Gross Profit increased  6.0% to $27.4 billion for fiscal 2013 from $25.8 billion for fiscal 2012 . Gross Profit for fiscal 2012 included a $10 million charge related to the China store closings. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 34.8% for fiscal 2013 compared to 34.6% for fiscal 2012 , an increase of 18 basis points. The increase in gross profit margin in fiscal 2013 was driven primarily by businesses we acquired in fiscal 2012, which are gross margin accretive, higher productivity in our supply chain and improved shrink performance, partially offset by a change in the mix of products sold. Operating Expenses Selling, General and Administrative expenses (\"SGA\") increased  0.5% to $16.6 billion for fiscal 2013 from $16.5 billion for fiscal 2012 . SGA for fiscal 2012 included a $135 million charge related to the China store closings. As a percent of Net Sales, SGA was 21.1% for fiscal 2013 compared to 22.1% for fiscal 2012 . The decrease in SGA as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2013 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment and strong expense controls. Depreciation and Amortization was $1.6 billion for both fiscal 2013 and 2012 . Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.1% for both fiscal 2013 and 2012 . Operating Income Operating Income increased  18.0% to $9.2 billion for fiscal 2013 from $7.8 billion for fiscal 2012 . Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 11.6% for fiscal 2013 compared to 10.4% for fiscal 2012 . Interest and Other, net In fiscal 2013 , we recognized $699 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $545 million for fiscal 2012 . Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.9% for fiscal 2013 compared to 0.7% for fiscal 2012 . The increase in Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2013 reflects increased interest expense associated with the issuance of $4.0 billion of incremental long-term debt in fiscal 2013. Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2012 included a $67 million pretax benefit related to the termination of our guarantee of a senior secured loan of HD Supply, Inc. Provision for Income Taxes Our combined effective income tax rate was 36.4% for fiscal 2013 compared to 37.2% for fiscal 2012 . The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 was higher than fiscal 2013 as we were unable to realize any tax benefit from the $145 million charge related to the China store closings for fiscal 2012. Excluding the charge related to the China store closings, our combined effective income tax rate was 36.5% for fiscal 2012. 20 Diluted Earnings per Share Diluted Earnings per Share were $3.76 for fiscal 2013 compared to $3.00 for fiscal 2012 . Excluding the charge related to the China store closings, Diluted Earnings per Share were $3.10 for fiscal 2012 . The 53 rd week increased Diluted Earnings per Share by approximately $0.07 for fiscal 2012. Non-GAAP Measures To provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting to exclude from some GAAP measures certain items that we do not consider to be representative of our actual operating performance. These financial calculations are \"non-GAAP financial measures\" as defined in SEC rules. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency that impact the comparability of underlying business results from period to period. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. The results for fiscal 2012 included a $145 million charge, net of tax, related to the China store closings as described more fully in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no adjustments for fiscal 2013 or 2011 for events of unusual nature or frequency. The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures for fiscal 2012 (amounts in millions, except per share data):  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended February 3, 2013  As Reported  Adjustments  Non-GAAP Measures  % of Net Sales Gross Profit $ 25,842  $ (10 )  $ 25,852  34.6 % Selling, General and Administrative 16,508   16,373  21.9 Operating Income 7,766  (145 )  7,911  10.6 Net Earnings 4,535  (145 )  4,680  6.3 % Diluted Earnings per Share $ 3.00  $ (0.10 )  $ 3.10  N/A ##TABLE_ENDFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Net Sales Fiscal 2012 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2011. Net Sales for fiscal 2012 increased 6.2% to $74.8 billion from $70.4 billion for fiscal 2011. The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2012 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales and $1.2 billion of Net Sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2012. Total comparable store sales increased 4.6% for fiscal 2012 compared to an increase of 3.4% for fiscal 2011. The positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2012 reflect a number of factors including the execution of our key initiatives and an improved U.S. housing market. All of our departments except for one posted positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2012, and comparable store average ticket increased 2.9% for fiscal 2012. Comparable store sales for our Lumber, Flooring, Paint, Tools, Bath, Electrical, Lighting, Indoor Garden and Dcor product categories were above or at the Company average for fiscal 2012. Comparable store sales for our Hardware, Plumbing, Outdoor Garden, Kitchen and Millwork product categories were positive for fiscal 2012. Comparable store sales for our Building Materials product category were negative for fiscal 2012, reflecting the impact of weather and difficult year-over-year comparisons in roofing due to storm and repair activity that drove sales in fiscal 2011. Gross Profit Gross Profit increased 6.5% to $25.8 billion for fiscal 2012 from $24.3 billion for fiscal 2011. Gross Profit for fiscal 2012 included a $10 million charge related to the China store closings. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 34.6% for fiscal 2012 compared to 34.5% for fiscal 2011, an increase of 10 basis points. The increase in gross profit margin in fiscal 2012 was driven primarily by a change in mix of products sold and benefits from our supply chain transformation in the U.S. Operating Expenses SGA increased 3.0% to $16.5 billion for fiscal 2012 from $16.0 billion for fiscal 2011. SGA for fiscal 2012 included a $135 million charge related to the China store closings. As a percent of Net Sales, SGA was 22.1% for fiscal 2012 compared to 22.8% for fiscal 2011. Excluding the charge related to the China store closings, SGA as a percent of Net Sales was 21.9% for fiscal 2012. The decrease in SGA as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2012 reflects expense leverage 21 resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment, strong expense controls, and lower credit card expense and casualty reserves, offset by the charge related to the China store closings. Depreciation and Amortization was $1.6 billion for both fiscal 2012 and 2011. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.1% for fiscal 2012 compared to 2.2% for fiscal 2011. The decrease in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment. Operating Income Operating Income increased 16.6% to $7.8 billion for fiscal 2012 from $6.7 billion for fiscal 2011. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 10.4% for fiscal 2012 compared to 9.5% for fiscal 2011. Excluding the charge related to the China store closings, Operating Income increased 18.8% to $7.9 billion for fiscal 2012. Interest and Other, net In fiscal 2012, we recognized $545 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $593 million for fiscal 2011. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.7% for fiscal 2012 compared to 0.8% for fiscal 2011. Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2012 included a $67 million pretax benefit related to the termination of our guarantee of a senior secured loan of HD Supply, Inc. Provision for Income Taxes Our combined effective income tax rate was 37.2% for fiscal 2012 compared to 36.0% for fiscal 2011. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 was higher than fiscal 2011 as we were unable to realize any tax benefit from the $145 million charge related to the China store closings. Excluding the charge related to the China store closings, our combined effective income tax rate was 36.5% for fiscal 2012. Additionally, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 reflects a benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards as well as certain favorable state and local tax settlements. Diluted Earnings per Share Diluted Earnings per Share were $3.00 for fiscal 2012 compared to $2.47 for fiscal 2011. Excluding the charge related to the China store closings, Diluted Earnings per Share were $3.10 for fiscal 2012. The 53 rd week increased Diluted Earnings per Share by approximately $0.07 for fiscal 2012. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. For fiscal 2013 , Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $ 7.6 billion compared to $ 7.0 billion for fiscal 2012 . This increase is primarily due to an $850 million  increase in Net Earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense controls. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities for fiscal 2013 was $ 1.5 billion compared to $ 1.4 billion for fiscal 2012 . This change was primarily due to a $77 million increase in Capital Expenditures in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities for fiscal 2013 was $ 6.7 billion compared to $ 5.0 billion for fiscal 2012 . The year-over-year increase of approximately $1.7 billion reflects a $4.6 billion increase in share repurchases, a $500 million increase in dividends paid to shareholders and $543 million less in proceeds from the sale of common stock, offset for the most part by $4.0 billion, net of repayments, of proceeds from long-term borrowings in fiscal 2013. In February 2013, our Board of Directors authorized a new $17.0 billion share repurchase program, under which we have repurchased 111 million shares of our common stock for a total of $8.5 billion as of the end of fiscal 2013 . We entered into ASR agreements with third-party financial institutions to repurchase $6.2 billion of our common stock in fiscal 2013 . Under the agreements, we paid $6.2 billion to the financial institutions and received a total of 81 million shares. Also in fiscal 2013 , we repurchased 30 million additional shares of our common stock for $2.3 billion through the open market. In September 2013, we issued $1.15 billion of 2.25% senior notes due September 10, 2018 (the \"2018 notes) at a discount of $1 million , $1.1 billion of 3.75% senior notes due February 15, 2024 (the \"2024 notes) at a discount of $6 million and $1.0 billion of 4.875% senior notes due February 15, 2044 (the \"2044 notes) at a discount of $15 million (together, the \"September 2013 issuance\"). Interest on the 2018 notes is due semi-annually on March 10 and September 10 of each year, beginning March 10, 2014. Interest on the 2024 notes and the 2044 notes is due semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning February 15, 2014. The net proceeds of the September 2013 issuance were used for general corporate 22 purposes, including repayment of our $1.25 billion  5.25% senior notes that matured December 16, 2013 and repurchases of shares of our common stock. In April 2013, we issued $1.0 billion of 2.70% senior notes due April 1, 2023 at a discount of $2 million and $1.0 billion of 4.20% senior notes due April 1, 2043 at a discount of $4 million (together, the \"April 2013 issuance\"). Interest on these senior notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2013. The net proceeds of the April 2013 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock. In November 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on September 10, 2018 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on the 2018 notes for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 88 basis points. At February 2, 2014, the approximate fair value of this agreement was a liability of $1 million , which is the estimated amount we would have paid to settle the agreement. Also in November 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on September 15, 2020 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on our 3.95% senior notes due September 15, 2020 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 183 basis points. At February 2, 2014, the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $2 million , which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement. At February 2, 2014, we had an outstanding interest rate swap that expires on March 1, 2016 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on our 5.40% senior notes due March 1, 2016 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 300 basis points. At February 2, 2014, the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $28 million , which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement. We have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . In connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . The credit facility expires in July 2017 and contains various restrictive covenants. At February 2, 2014 , we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. As of February 2, 2014 , there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our commercial paper programs and related credit facility. We use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers and store support centers. The net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-Term Debt and Current Installments of Long-Term Debt. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with the sale of HD Supply on August 30, 2007, we guaranteed a $1.0 billion senior secured amortizing term loan of HD Supply. The original expiration date of the guarantee was August 30, 2012. In March 2010, we amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to April 1, 2014. The fair value of the guarantee at August 30, 2007 was $16 million and was recorded as a liability in Other Long-Term Liabilities. The extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to $67 million, resulting in a $51 million charge to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2010. In April 2012, the term loan guarantee was terminated. As a result, we reversed the $67 million liability related to the guarantee, resulting in a $67 million pretax benefit to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2012. As of February 2, 2014 , we had $ 1.9 billion in Cash and Cash Equivalents. We believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. In March 2014, we entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $950 million of our common stock. Under the agreement, we paid $950 million to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of approximately 10 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement will be determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the ASR agreement. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 23 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of February 2, 2014 (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual Obligations Total   2015-2016  2017-2018  Thereafter Total Debt (1) $ 14,255  $  $ 3,003  $ 1,150  $ 10,100 Interest Payments on Debt (2) 10,795   1,233  1,021  7,891 Capital Lease Obligations (3) 1,180     Operating Leases 8,196   1,597  1,248  4,456 Purchase Obligations (4) 1,238  1,205     Unrecognized Tax Benefits (5)        Total $ 35,746  $ 2,933  $ 6,051  $ 3,592  $ 23,170 ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1) Excludes present value of capital lease obligations, fair value of interest rate swaps and unamortized debt discounts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Interest payments are at current interest rates including the impact of active interest rate swaps. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Includes $ 681 million of imputed interest. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, software acquisitions and license commitments and legally binding service contracts.

Interest rate swap agreements are used, at times, to manage our fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. At February 2, 2014 , after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, approximately 89% of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate debt and 11% was floating-rate debt. A 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. As of February 2, 2014 we had, net of discounts, $ 14.2 billion of senior notes outstanding. The aggregate market value of these publicly traded senior notes as of February 2, 2014 was approximately $ 15.6 billion . Although we have international operating entities, our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition or results of operations. Impact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices We have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates. Revenues We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. We have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. However, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely impacted. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated 24 Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. We also record Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. Merchandise Inventories Our Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, with approximately 74% valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method. Retailers like us, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, Merchandise Inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. We evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the end of fiscal 2013 or 2012 . Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, \"swell\") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. We estimate shrink as a percent of Net Sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. The estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2013 , 2012 or 2011 . Self-Insurance We have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability (including product liability), workers compensation, employee group medical and automobile claims for which we are self-insured. Our self-insured retention or deductible, as applicable, for each claim involving general liability, workers' compensation and automobile liability is limited to $25 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively. We do not have any stop loss limits for self-insured employee group medical claims. Our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. The liabilities are reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2013 , 2012 or 2011 . Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. We believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors. Volume rebates and certain advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in SGA. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, managements decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. 25 The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, we also recognize in SGA the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of long-lived assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition and inflation. A 10% decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations. Our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations. A 10% decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10% increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations. We recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, as well as for the China store closings in fiscal 2012, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2013 , 2012 or 2011 . Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. Each year we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments, with a quantitative assessment completed at least once every three years. In fiscal 2013 , we elected to estimate the fair values of our identified reporting units using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows. We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition, inflation and discount rates. A 10% decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting units would not result in an impairment. A 1.0 percentage point increase in the discount rate used would also not result in an impairment. The reporting units assessed for impairment during fiscal 2013 were U.S., Canada and Mexico. During fiscal 2013 , we determined that our goodwill balances for each of these reporting units were not impaired, as we determined the fair value for each of these reporting units was substantially above its carrying value. In fiscal 2012, we recorded a charge of $97 million to impair all of the goodwill associated with our former China reporting unit. There were no impairment charges related to our remaining goodwill for fiscal 2013 , 2012 or 2011 . We amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to ten years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. There were no impairment charges related to our other intangible assets for fiscal 2013 , 2012 or 2011 . ", "7A": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and properly reflect certain estimates and judgments based upon the best available information. The financial statements of the Company have been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their accompanying report is based upon an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting solely of independent directors, meets five times a year with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and representatives of management to discuss auditing and financial reporting matters. In addition, a telephonic meeting is held prior to each quarterly earnings release. The Audit Committee retains the independent registered public accounting firm and regularly reviews the internal accounting controls, the activities of the independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors and the financial condition of the Company. Both the Companys independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2014 based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of February 2, 2014 in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2014 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included on page 28 in this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START /s/ F RANCIS S.

The Home Depot, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, The Home Depot, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 2, 2014 , and our report dated March 27, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/ KPMG LLP Atlanta, Georgia March 27, 2014  28 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders The Home Depot, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 2, 2014 . These Consolidated Financial Statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Consolidated Financial Statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 2, 2014 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business, Consolidation and Presentation The Home Depot, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") operate The Home Depot stores, which are full-service, warehouse-style stores averaging approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. The stores stock approximately 30,000 to 40,000 different kinds of building materials, home improvement supplies and lawn and garden products that are sold to do-it-yourself customers, do-it-for-me customers and professional customers. The Company also offers over 700,000 products through its Home Depot and Home Decorators Collection websites. At the end of fiscal 2013 , the Company was operating 2,263 The Home Depot stores, which included 1,977 stores in the United States, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam (\"U.S.\"), 180 stores in Canada and 106 stores in Mexico. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year is a 52 - or 53 -week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31 . Fiscal year ended February 2, 2014 (\"fiscal 2013 \") includes 52 weeks, fiscal year ended February 3, 2013 (\"fiscal 2012 \") includes 53 weeks and fiscal year ended January 29, 2012 (\"fiscal 2011 \") includes 52 weeks. Use of Estimates Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses in preparing these financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Receivables and Accounts Payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments. The fair value of the Companys Long-Term Debt is discussed in Note 10. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Companys cash equivalents are carried at fair market value and consist primarily of money market funds. Accounts Receivable The Company has an agreement with a third-party service provider who directly extends credit to customers, manages the Companys private label credit card program and owns the related receivables. The Company evaluated the third-party entities holding the receivables under the program and concluded that they should not be consolidated by the Company. The agreement with the third-party service provider expires in 2018 , with the Company having the option, but no obligation, to purchase the receivables at the end of the agreement. The deferred interest charges incurred by the Company for its deferred financing programs offered to its customers are included in Cost of Sales. The interchange fees charged to the Company for the customers use of the cards and any profit sharing with the third-party service provider are included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses (\"SGA\"). The sum of the three is referred to by the Company as \"the cost of credit\" of the private label credit card program. In addition, certain subsidiaries of the Company extend credit directly to customers in the ordinary course of business. The receivables due from customers were $ 57 million and $ 42 million as of February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 , respectively. The Companys valuation reserve related to accounts receivable was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of the end of fiscal 2013 or 2012 . Merchandise Inventories The majority of the Companys Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, as determined by the retail inventory method. As the inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, the inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Certain subsidiaries, including retail 35 operations in Canada and Mexico, and distribution centers, record Merchandise Inventories at the lower of cost or market, as determined by a cost method. These Merchandise Inventories represent approximately 26% of the total Merchandise Inventories balance. The Company evaluates the inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of the end of fiscal 2013 or 2012 . Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in stores, the Company accrues for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis based on historical shrink results and current trends in the business. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, \"swell\") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. The Company provides for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as for those deferred due to timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Non-U.S. subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, are not eligible to be included in the Companys consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Separate provisions for income taxes have been determined for these entities. The Company intends to reinvest substantially all of the unremitted earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries and postpone their remittance indefinitely. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes for these non-U.S. subsidiaries was recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Depreciation and Amortization The Companys Buildings, Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold Improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the original term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. The Companys Property and Equipment is depreciated using the following estimated useful lives:  ##TABLE_START  Life Buildings 5  45 years Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment 2  20 years Leasehold Improvements 5  45 years ##TABLE_ENDCapitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to six years. These costs are included in Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment as discussed further in Note 2. Certain development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred. Revenues The Company recognizes revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. The liability for sales returns is estimated based on historical return levels. When the Company receives payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets 36 until the sale or service is complete. The Company also records Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognizes this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. Gift card breakage income is recognized based upon historical redemption patterns and represents the balance of gift cards for which the Company believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote. During fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , the Company recognized $ 30 million , $ 33 million and $ 42 million , respectively, of gift card breakage income. This income is included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a reduction in SGA. Services Revenue Net Sales include services revenue generated through a variety of installation, home maintenance and professional service programs. In these programs, the customer selects and purchases material for a project, and the Company provides or arranges professional installation. These programs are offered through the Companys stores and in-home sales programs. Under certain programs, when the Company provides or arranges the installation of a project and the subcontractor provides material as part of the installation, both the material and labor are included in services revenue. The Company recognizes this revenue when the service for the customer is complete. All payments received prior to the completion of services are recorded in Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Services revenue was $ 3.5 billion , $ 3.2 billion and $ 2.9 billion for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Self-Insurance The Company is self-insured for certain losses related to general liability (including product liability), workers compensation, employee group medical and automobile claims. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date is not discounted and is recognized as a liability. The expected ultimate cost of claims is estimated based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. Prepaid Advertising Television and radio advertising production costs, along with media placement costs, are expensed when the advertisement first appears. Amounts included in Other Current Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to prepayments of production costs for print and broadcast advertising as well as sponsorship promotions were not material at the end of fiscal 2013 and 2012 . Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and certain advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense. In fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , gross advertising expense was $ 865 million , $ 831 million and $ 846 million , respectively, and is included in SGA. Specific, incremental and identifiable advertising co-op allowances were $ 114 million , $ 85 million and $ 94 million for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively, and are recorded as an offset to advertising expense in SGA. Cost of Sales Cost of Sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed, the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to the Companys stores, locations or customers, the operating cost of the Companys sourcing and distribution network and the cost of deferred interest programs offered through the Companys private label credit card program. The cost of handling and shipping merchandise from the Companys stores, locations or distribution centers to the customer is classified as SGA. The cost of shipping and handling, including internal costs and payments to third parties, classified as SGA was $ 477 million , $ 435 million and $ 430 million in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. 37 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates its long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, managements decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, the Company also recognizes in SGA the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. The Company recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, as well as for the closing of seven stores in China in fiscal 2012, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2013, 2012 or 2011. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. The Company does not amortize goodwill but does assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. Each year the Company may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments, with a quantitative assessment completed at least once every three years. In fiscal 2013 , the Company elected to estimate the fair values of its identified reporting units using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows. The reporting units assessed for impairment during fiscal 2013 were U.S., Canada and Mexico. During fiscal 2013 , the Company determined that its goodwill balances for each of these reporting units were not impaired, as the Company determined the fair value of each of these reporting units was substantially above its carrying value. In fiscal 2012, the Company recorded a charge of $97 million to impair all of the goodwill associated with the former China reporting unit. There were no impairment charges related to the remaining goodwill for fiscal 2013 , 2012 or 2011 . The Company amortizes the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to ten years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. There were no impairment charges related to other intangible assets for fiscal 2013 , 2012 or 2011 . Stock-Based Compensation The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $ 13.10 , $ 9.86 and $ 7.42 , respectively. The fair value of these options was determined at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  February 2, 2014  February 3, 2013  January 29, 2012 Risk-free interest rate 0.8 %  1.2 %  2.0 % Assumed volatility 26.3 %  27.0 %  27.3 % Assumed dividend yield 2.2 %  2.3 %  2.7 % Assumed lives of options 5 years  5 years  5 years ##TABLE_ENDDerivatives The Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate exposure on long-term debt and its exposure on foreign currency fluctuations. The Company accounts for its derivative financial instruments in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (\"FASB ASC\") Subtopic 815-10. The fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments is discussed in Note 10. 38 Comprehensive Income Comprehensive Income includes Net Earnings adjusted for certain gains and losses that are excluded from Net Earnings under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Adjustments to Net Earnings and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income consist primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses are generally translated using average exchange rates for the period and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the day of the transaction. Segment Information The Company operates within a single reportable segment primarily within North America. Net Sales for the Company outside the U.S. were $ 8.5 billion , $ 8.4 billion and $ 8.0 billion for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Long-lived assets outside the U.S. totaled $ 2.9 billion and $ 3.1 billion as of February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 , respectively. The following table presents the Net Sales of each major product category (and related services) for each of the last three fiscal years (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START Product Category Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2014  February 3, 2013  January 29, 2012  Net Sales % of Net Sales  Net Sales % of Net Sales  Net Sales % of Net Sales Kitchen $ 7,978 10.1 %  $ 7,022 9.4 %  $ 6,609 9.4 % Indoor Garden 7,072 9.0  6,699 9.0  6,292 8.9 Paint 7,026 8.9  6,764 9.0  6,278 8.9 Outdoor Garden 6,094 7.7  5,904 7.9  5,615 8.0 Lumber 5,814 7.4  5,454 7.3  4,934 7.0 Flooring 5,734 7.3  5,469 7.3  5,167 7.3 Building Materials 5,729 7.3  5,594 7.5  5,694 8.1 Plumbing 5,437 6.9  5,126 6.9  4,887 6.9 Electrical 5,364 6.8  5,039 6.7  4,582 6.5 Tools 5,039 6.4  4,795 6.4  4,441 6.3 Hardware 4,718 6.0  4,580 6.1  4,325 6.1 Millwork 4,386 5.6  4,281 5.7  4,142 5.9 Bath 3,706 4.7  3,552 4.8  3,309 4.7 Lighting 2,369 3.0  2,250 3.0  2,092 3.0 Dcor 2,346 3.0  2,225 3.0  2,028 2.9 Total $ 78,812 100.0 %  $ 74,754 100.0 %  $ 70,395 100.0 % ##TABLE_ENDNote: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding.

PROPERTY AND LEASES Property and Equipment as of February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 consisted of the following (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  February 2, 2014  February 3, 2013 Property and Equipment, at cost:    Land $ 8,375  $ 8,485 Buildings 17,950  17,981 Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment 10,107  9,338 Leasehold Improvements 1,388  1,382 Construction in Progress  Capital Leases   39,064  38,491 Less Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization 15,716  14,422 Net Property and Equipment $ 23,348  $ 24,069 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company leases certain retail locations, office space, warehouse and distribution space, equipment and vehicles. While most of the leases are operating leases, certain locations and equipment are leased under capital leases. As leases expire, it can be expected that in the normal course of business certain leases will be renewed or replaced. Certain lease agreements include escalating rents over the lease terms. The Company expenses rent on a straight-line basis over the lease term, which commences on the date the Company has the right to control the property. The cumulative expense recognized on a straight-line basis in excess of the cumulative payments is included in Other Accrued Expenses and Other Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total rent expense, net of minor sublease income, for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $ 905 million , $ 849 million and $ 823 million , respectively. Certain store leases also provide for contingent rent payments based on percentages of sales in excess of specified minimums. Contingent rent expense for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was approximately $ 5 million , $ 4 million and $ 4 million , respectively. Real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and operating expenses applicable to the leased property are obligations of the Company under the lease agreements. The approximate future minimum lease payments under capital and all other leases at February 2, 2014 were as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Capital Leases Operating Leases $ $ 2015 843 92 2017 674 83 Thereafter through 2097 4,456 1,180 $ 8,196 Less imputed interest Net present value of capital lease obligations Less current installments Long-term capital lease obligations, excluding current installments $ ##TABLE_ENDShort-term and long-term obligations for capital leases are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in Current Installments of Long-Term Debt and Long-Term Debt, respectively. The assets under capital leases recorded in Property and Equipment, net of amortization, totaled $ 374 million and $ 368 million at February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 , respectively.  40 3. DEBT The Company has commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . In connection with the programs, the Company has a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . The credit facility expires in July 2017 and contains various restrictive covenants. At February 2, 2014, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact the Companys liquidity or capital resources. There were no borrowings under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility in fiscal 2013 and 2012. The Companys Long-Term Debt at the end of fiscal 2013 and 2012 consisted of the following (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  February 2, 2014  February 3, 2013 5.25% Senior Notes; due December 16, 2013; interest payable semi-annually on June 16 and December 16 $   $ 1,286 5.40% Senior Notes; due March 1, 2016; interest payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 3,042  3,058 2.25% Senior Notes; due September 10, 2018; interest payable semi-annually on March 10 and September 10 1,148   3.95% Senior Notes; due September 15, 2020; interest payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15  4.40% Senior Notes; due April 1, 2021; interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1  2.70% Senior Notes; due April 1, 2023; interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1   3.75% Senior Notes; due February 15, 2024; interest payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 1,094   5.875% Senior Notes; due December 16, 2036; interest payable semi-annually on June 16 and December 16 2,962  2,962 5.40% Senior Notes; due September 15, 2040; interest payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15  5.95% Senior Notes; due April 1, 2041; interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1  4.20% Senior Notes; due April 1, 2043; interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1   4.875% Senior Notes; due February 15, 2044; interest payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15   Capital Lease Obligations; payable in varying installments through January 31, 2055  Other  Total debt 14,724  10,796 Less current installments  1,321 Long-Term Debt, excluding current installments $ 14,691  $ 9,475 ##TABLE_ENDIn September 2013, the Company issued $1.15 billion of 2.25% senior notes due September 10, 2018 (the \"2018 notes) at a discount of $1 million , $1.1 billion of 3.75% senior notes due February 15, 2024 (the \"2024 notes) at a discount of $6 million and $1.0 billion of 4.875% senior notes due February 15, 2044 (the \"2044 notes) at a discount of $15 million (together, the \"September 2013 issuance\"). Interest on the 2018 notes is due semi-annually on March 10 and September 10 of each year, beginning March 10, 2014. Interest on the 2024 notes and the 2044 notes is due semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning February 15, 2014. The net proceeds of the September 2013 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of the Company's $1.25 billion  5.25% senior notes that matured December 16, 2013 and repurchases of shares of the Company's common stock. The $22 million discount associated with the September 2013 issuance is being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method. Issuance costs associated with the September 2013 issuance were approximately $19 million and are being amortized over the term of the notes. 41 In April 2013, the Company issued $1.0 billion of 2.70% senior notes due April 1, 2023 at a discount of $2 million and $1.0 billion of 4.20% senior notes due April 1, 2043 at a discount of $4 million (together, the \"April 2013 issuance\"). Interest on these senior notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2013. The net proceeds of the April 2013 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of the Company's common stock. The $6 million discount associated with the April 2013 issuance is being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method. Issuance costs associated with the April 2013 issuance were approximately $15 million and are being amortized over the term of the notes. The notes may be redeemed by the Company at any time, in whole or in part, at the redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, if a Change in Control Triggering Event occurs, as defined in each of the outstanding notes except for the 5.40% senior notes due March 1, 2016 (the \"2016 notes\"), holders of all notes other than the 2016 notes have the right to require the Company to redeem those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The Company is generally not limited under the indentures governing the notes in its ability to incur additional indebtedness or required to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. Further, while the indentures governing the notes contain various restrictive covenants, none are expected to impact the Companys liquidity or capital resources. In November 2013, the Company entered into an interest rate swap that expires on September 10, 2018 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on the Companys 2.25% senior notes due September 10, 2018 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 88 basis points.

During fiscal 2013, the Company had outstanding interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, with a notional amount of $1.25 billion that swapped fixed rate interest on the Companys $1.25 billion  5.25% senior notes that expired when the notes were repaid on December 16, 2013 . At February 2, 2014, the Company had outstanding cross currency swap agreements with a notional amount of $676 million , accounted for as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency fluctuations on certain intercompany debt. At February 2, 2014, the approximate fair value of these agreements was a liability of $9 million , which is the estimated amount the Company would have paid to settle the agreements and is included in Other Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings is net of interest capitalized of $2 million , $3 million and $3 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS In fiscal 2013, the Company entered into Accelerated Share Repurchase (\"ASR\") agreements with third-party financial institutions to repurchase $6.2 billion of the Companys common stock. Under the agreements, the Company paid $6.2 billion to the financial institutions and received a total of 81 million shares in fiscal 2013.

In March 2014, the Company entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $950 million of the Company's common stock. Under the agreement, the Company paid $950 million to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of approximately 10 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement will be determined with reference to the average price of the Company's common stock over the term of the ASR agreement. 5. INCOME TAXES The components of Earnings before Provision for Income Taxes for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 were as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  February 2, 2014  February 3, 2013  January 29, 2012 United States $ 7,770  $ 6,677  $ 5,508 Foreign   Total $ 8,467  $ 7,221  $ 6,068 ##TABLE_ENDThe Provision for Income Taxes consisted of the following (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  February 2, 2014  February 3, 2013  January 29, 2012 Current:      Federal $ 2,503  $ 2,060  $ 1,566 State   Foreign    3,114  2,592  1,950 Deferred:      Federal (12 )   State   Foreign (24 )  (21 )   (32 )   Total $ 3,082  $ 2,686  $ 2,185 ##TABLE_END43 The Companys combined federal, state and foreign effective tax rates for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 were approximately 36.4% , 37.2% and 36.0% , respectively. The reconciliation of the Provision for Income Taxes at the federal statutory rate of 35% to the actual tax expense for the applicable fiscal years was as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  February 2, 2014  February 3, 2013  January 29, 2012 Income taxes at federal statutory rate $ 2,964  $ 2,527  $ 2,125 State income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit   Other, net (109 )  (38 )  (115 ) Total $ 3,082  $ 2,686  $ 2,185 ##TABLE_ENDThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 were as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  February 2, 2014  February 3, 2013 Assets:    Deferred compensation $  $ Accrued self-insurance liabilities  State income taxes  Non-deductible reserves  Capital loss carryover  Net operating losses  Impairment of investment  Other  Total Deferred Tax Assets 1,662  1,575 Valuation Allowance (26 )  (27 ) Total Deferred Tax Assets after Valuation Allowance 1,636  1,548     Liabilities:    Inventory (97 )  (92 ) Property and equipment (1,236 )  (1,194 ) Goodwill and other intangibles (150 )  (112 ) Other (138 )  (128 ) Total Deferred Tax Liabilities (1,621 )  (1,526 ) Net Deferred Tax Assets $  $ ##TABLE_ENDCurrent deferred tax assets and current deferred tax liabilities are netted by tax jurisdiction and noncurrent deferred tax assets and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities are netted by tax jurisdiction, and are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  February 2, 2014  February 3, 2013 Other Current Assets $  $ Other Assets  Other Accrued Expenses (2 )  (2 ) Deferred Income Taxes (514 )  (319 ) Net Deferred Tax Assets $  $ ##TABLE_END44 The Company believes that the realization of the deferred tax assets is more likely than not, based upon the expectation that it will generate the necessary taxable income in future periods, and except for certain net operating losses discussed below, no valuation reserves have been provided. At February 2, 2014, the Company had state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, expiring at various dates beginning 2014 to 2033 . Management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits related to the state net operating losses will be realized. However, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to utilize certain foreign net operating losses. Therefore, a valuation allowance has been provided to reduce the deferred tax asset related to foreign net operating losses to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Total valuation allowances related to net operating losses at February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 were $26 million and $27 million , respectively. In fiscal 2011, the Company was able to utilize a portion of its capital loss carryforward. This utilization combined with other available tax planning strategies enabled the Company to release its $45 million valuation allowance associated with the capital loss carryforward. The Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on approximately $3.1 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries because of its intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable; however, unrecognized foreign income tax credits would be available to reduce a portion of this liability. The Companys income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. The Company is currently appealing certain proposed Internal Revenue Service examination adjustments for fiscal years 2005 through 2007. The Company's U.S. federal tax returns for fiscal years 2008 through 2011 are currently under examination by the IRS. There are also ongoing U.S. state and local and other foreign audits covering tax years 2005 through 2012. The Company does not expect the results from any income tax audit to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. Over the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the resolution of federal and state tax examinations could reduce the Company's unrecognized tax benefits by $82 million . Final settlement of these audit issues may result in payments that are more or less than this amount, but the Company does not anticipate the resolution of these matters will result in a material change to its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Reconciliations of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 were as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  February 2, 2014  February 3, 2013  January 29, 2012 Unrecognized tax benefits balance at beginning of fiscal year $  $  $ Additions based on tax positions related to the current year   Additions for tax positions of prior years   Reductions for tax positions of prior years (41 )  (15 )  (123 ) Reductions due to settlements (12 )  (94 )  (4 ) Reductions due to lapse of statute of limitations (7 )  (3 )  (7 ) Unrecognized tax benefits balance at end of fiscal year $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the annual effective income tax rate on Net Earnings was $344 million , $314 million and $246 million as of February 2, 2014 , February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 , respectively. Net adjustments to accruals for interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions resulted in expense of $7 million and $15 million in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively, and provided income of $2 million in fiscal 2011 . Total accrued interest and penalties as of February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 were $101 million and $97 million , respectively. Interest and penalties are included in Interest Expense and SGA, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 45 6. EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS The Home Depot, Inc. Amended and Restated 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (\"2005 Plan\") and The Home Depot, Inc. 1997 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (\"1997 Plan\" and collectively with the 2005 Plan, the \"Plans\") provide that incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares, performance units and deferred shares may be issued to selected associates, officers and directors of the Company. Under the 2005 Plan, the maximum number of shares of the Companys common stock authorized for issuance is 255 million shares, with any award other than a stock option or stock appreciation right reducing the number of shares available for issuance by 2.11 shares. As of February 2, 2014 , there were 147 million shares available for future grants under the 2005 Plan. No additional equity awards could be issued from the 1997 Plan after the adoption of the 2005 Plan on May 26, 2005. Under the terms of the Plans, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options must have an exercise price at or above the fair market value of the Companys stock on the date of the grant. Typically, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options vest at the rate of 25% per year commencing on the first or second anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth anniversary date of the grant. Additionally, certain stock options may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The Company recognized $ 24 million , $ 23 million and $ 20 million of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively, related to stock options. Restrictions on the restricted stock issued under the Plans generally lapse according to one of the following schedules: (1) the restrictions on the restricted stock lapse over various periods up to five years , (2) the restrictions on 25% of the restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing upon the associates attainment of age 62, or (3) the restrictions on 25% of the restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing upon the earlier of the associates attainment of age 60 or the tenth anniversary of the grant date. The Company has also granted performance shares under the Plans, the payout of which is dependent on the Companys performance against target average return on invested capital and operating profit over a three-year performance cycle. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The fair value of the restricted stock and performance shares is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and performance shares of $ 171 million , $ 166 million and $ 169 million in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. In fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , there were an aggregate of 223 thousand , 313 thousand and 422 thousand deferred shares, respectively, granted under the Plans. For associates, each deferred share entitles the individual to one share of common stock to be received up to five years after the grant date of the deferred shares, subject to certain deferral rights of the associate. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to deferred shares of $ 14 million , $ 13 million and $ 12 million in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The Company maintains two Employee Stock Purchase Plans (\"ESPPs\") (U.S. and non-U.S. plans). The plan for U.S. associates is a tax-qualified plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The non-U.S. plan is not a Section 423 plan. As of February 2, 2014 , there were 25 million shares available under the plan for U.S associates and 19 million shares available under the non-U.S. plan. The purchase price of shares under the ESPPs is equal to 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day of the purchase period, which is a six-month period ending on December 31 and June 30 of each year. During fiscal 2013 , there were 2 million shares purchased under the ESPPs at an average price of $ 67.83 . Under the outstanding ESPPs as of February 2, 2014 , employees have contributed $ 13 million to purchase shares at 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day (June 30, 2014) of the current purchase period. The Company recognized $ 19 million , $ 16 million and $ 14 million of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively, related to the ESPPs. In total, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense, including the expense of stock options, ESPP shares, restricted stock, performance shares and deferred shares, of $ 228 million , $ 218 million and $ 215 million , in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. 46 The following table summarizes stock options outstanding at February 2, 2014 , February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 , and changes during the fiscal years ended on these dates (shares in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Number of Shares  Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at January 30, 2011 44,467  $ 35.56 Granted 3,236  36.55 Exercised (6,938 )  33.25 Canceled (7,595 )  39.11 Outstanding at January 29, 2012 33,170  $ 35.32 Granted 2,376  49.89 Exercised (18,119 )  38.24 Canceled (810 )  35.27 Outstanding at February 3, 2013 16,617  $ 34.23 Granted 1,704  69.91 Exercised (4,240 )  31.71 Canceled (122 )  43.80 Outstanding at February 2, 2014 13,959  $ 39.26 ##TABLE_ENDThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $ 181 million , $ 246 million and $ 47 million in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. As of February 2, 2014 , there were approximately 14 million stock options outstanding with a weighted average remaining life of six years and an intrinsic value of $ 525 million . As of February 2, 2014 , there were approximately 5 million stock options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $ 30.77 , a weighted average remaining life of four years, and an intrinsic value of $ 253 million . As of February 2, 2014 , there were approximately 11 million stock options vested or expected to ultimately vest. As of February 2, 2014 , there was $ 38 million of unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years. The following table summarizes restricted stock and performance shares outstanding at February 2, 2014 , February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 , and changes during the fiscal years ended on these dates (shares in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Number of Shares  Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at January 30, 2011 19,439  $ 30.18 Granted 5,776  35.83 Restrictions lapsed (7,937 )  31.00 Canceled (1,537 )  30.48 Outstanding at January 29, 2012 15,741  $ 31.81 Granted 3,965  49.18 Restrictions lapsed (5,295 )  30.62 Canceled (1,172 )  35.29 Outstanding at February 3, 2013 13,239  $ 37.18 Granted 3,092  68.44 Restrictions lapsed (5,048 )  30.67 Canceled (827 )  46.53 Outstanding at February 2, 2014 10,456  $ 48.82 ##TABLE_ENDAs of February 2, 2014 , there was $ 291 million of unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and performance shares, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company maintains active defined contribution retirement plans for its employees (the \"Benefit Plans\"). All associates satisfying certain service requirements are eligible to participate in the Benefit Plans. The Company makes cash contributions each payroll period up to specified percentages of associates contributions as approved by the Board of Directors. The Company also maintains a restoration plan to provide certain associates deferred compensation that they would have received under the Benefit Plans as a matching contribution if not for the maximum compensation limits under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company funds the restoration plan through contributions made to a grantor trust, which are then used to purchase shares of the Companys common stock in the open market. The Companys contributions to the Benefit Plans and the restoration plan were $ 184 million , $ 182 million and $ 171 million for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. At February 2, 2014 , the Benefit Plans and the restoration plan held a total of 11 million shares of the Companys common stock in trust for plan participants.  8. CHINA STORE CLOSINGS In fiscal 2012, the Company closed its remaining seven big box stores in China. As a result of the closings, the Company recorded a total charge of $145 million , net of tax, in fiscal 2012. Inventory markdown costs of $10 million are included in Cost of Sales, and $135 million of costs related to the impairment of Goodwill and other assets, lease terminations, severance and other charges are included in SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 9. DEBT GUARANTEE In connection with the sale of HD Supply, Inc. on August 30, 2007 , the Company guaranteed a $ 1.0 billion senior secured amortizing term loan of HD Supply. The original expiration date of the guarantee was August 30, 2012. In March 2010, the Company amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to April 1, 2014. The fair value of the guarantee at August 30, 2007 was $16 million and was recorded as a liability of the Company in Other Long-Term Liabilities. The extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to $67 million , resulting in a $51 million charge to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2010. In April 2012 , the term loan guarantee was terminated. As a result, the Company reversed its $67 million liability related to the guarantee, resulting in a $67 million pretax benefit to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2012. 10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties. A liabilitys fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, rather than the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: ##TABLE_START  Level 1  Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets  Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  Level 3  Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions ##TABLE_END48 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The assets and liabilities of the Company that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 were as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  Fair Value at February 2, 2014 Using  Fair Value at February 3, 2013 Using  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Derivative agreements - assets $   $  $   $   $  $  Derivative agreements - liabilities   (10 )      (15 )   Total $   $  $   $   $  $  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate exposure on long-term debt and its exposure on foreign currency fluctuations. The fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments was measured using level 2 inputs. The Companys derivative agreements are discussed further in Note 3. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Upon announcement in fiscal 2012 of its intention to close seven stores in China, the Company completed an assessment on the recoverability of Goodwill for its China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was estimated using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows through unobservable inputs (level 3). As a result of this analysis, the Company recorded a $97 million impairment charge to Goodwill in fiscal 2012. See Note 8 for further discussion of the China store closings. Long-lived assets, the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets were also analyzed for impairment on a nonrecurring basis using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3). Impairment charges related to long-lived assets, the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal 2013 and 2012 were not material, as further discussed in Note 1 under the captions \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\" and \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" respectively. The aggregate fair value of the Companys senior notes, based on quoted market prices, was $ 15.6 billion and $ 12.2 billion at February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 , respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 14.2 billion and $ 10.3 billion at February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 , respectively. 11. BASIC AND DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES The reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average common shares for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  February 2, 2014  February 3, 2013  January 29, 2012 Weighted average common shares 1,425  1,499  1,562 Effect of potentially dilutive securities:      Stock plans   Diluted weighted average common shares 1,434  1,511  1,570 ##TABLE_ENDStock plans consist of shares granted under the Companys employee stock plans as described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Options to purchase 1 million , 1 million and 23 million shares of common stock at February 2, 2014 , February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 , respectively, were excluded from the computation of Diluted Earnings per Share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 49 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES At February 2, 2014 , the Company was contingently liable for approximately $372 million under outstanding letters of credit and open accounts issued for certain business transactions, including insurance programs, trade contracts and construction contracts. The Companys letters of credit are primarily performance-based and are not based on changes in variable components, a liability or an equity security of the other party. The Company is involved in litigation arising from the normal course of business. In managements opinion, this litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  13.

Business. Introduction The Home Depot, Inc. is the worlds largest home improvement retailer based on Net Sales for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2015 (\"fiscal 2014 \"). The Home Depot stores sell a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products and lawn and garden products and provide a number of services. The Home Depot stores average approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. As of the end of fiscal 2014 , we had 2,269 The Home Depot stores located throughout the United States, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam, Canada and Mexico. When we refer to \"The Home Depot,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\" in this report, we are referring to The Home Depot, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Home Depot, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1978. Our Store Support Center (corporate office) is located at 2455 Paces Ferry Road, N.W., Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Our telephone number is (770) 433-8211. Our internet website is www.homedepot.com. We make available on the Investor Relations section of our website, free of charge, our Annual Reports to shareholders, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such documents with, or furnishing such documents to, the SEC. We include our website addresses throughout this filing for reference only. The information contained on our websites is not incorporated by reference into this report. For information on key financial highlights, including historical revenues, profits and total assets, see the \"Five-Year Summary of Financial and Operating Results\" on page F-1 of this report and Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" 1 Data Breach In the third quarter of fiscal 2014 , we confirmed that our payment data systems were breached, which impacted customers who used payment cards at our U.S. and Canadian stores (the \"Data Breach\"). For a description of matters related to the Data Breach, see Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements.\" Our Business Operating Strategy  Over the past several years, we have maintained a consistent strategic framework comprised of three key initiatives  Customer Service; Product Authority; and Disciplined Capital Allocation, Productivity and Efficiency  tied together through our Interconnected Retail initiative. In fiscal 2014 , we focused on continuing to enhance our capability to deliver a superior interconnected retail experience for our customers. As customers increasingly expect to be able to buy how, when and where they want, we believe that providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels, featuring innovative and expanded product choices, will be a key enabler for future success. Becoming a best-in-class interconnected retailer is growing in importance as the line between online and in-store shopping continues to blur. Our interconnected retail initiative supports and connects the three other key initiatives of our long-standing strategic framework, with the overall goal of strengthening the connectivity between our stores and our online channels and our connectivity with our customers. Our interconnected retail efforts are woven through each of our other three initiatives, each of which is discussed in more detail below. For example, under our customer service initiative, we strengthened connectivity in fiscal 2014 by rolling out the next generation of the FIRST Phone, a handheld mobile customer service tool used by our store associates. Under our product authority initiative, we continued to enhance our website and mobile sites, which serve as an extended aisle of products, product information and guidance on projects and services. Under our productivity and efficiency initiative, we continued to optimize our supply chain capabilities to build connectivity among our delivery channels. In fiscal 2014 , we started a pilot for Buy Online, Deliver From Store (\"BODFS\"), which complements our existing interconnected retail programs: Buy Online, Pick-up In Store (\"BOPIS\"), Buy Online, Ship to Store (\"BOSS\") and Buy Online, Return In Store (\"BORIS\"). Customer Service Our customer service initiative is anchored on the principles of simplifying the business, creating an emotional connection with our customers, putting customers first and taking care of our associates.  Our long-standing goal has been to remove complexity from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers, and in fiscal 2014 we continued programs to reduce unnecessary store reports, store-based emails and meetings that took away from the time store associates could spend on selling activities. Our Customers . The Home Depot stores serve three primary customer groups, and we have different customer service approaches to meet their particular needs: ##TABLE_START  Do-It-Yourself (\"DIY\") Customers. These customers are typically home owners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. Our associates assist these customers with specific product and installation questions both in our stores and through online resources and other media designed to provide product and project knowledge. We also offer a variety of clinics and workshops both to impart this knowledge and to build an emotional connection with our DIY customers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Do-It-For-Me (\"DIFM\") Customers. These customers are typically home owners who purchase materials and hire third parties to complete the project or installation. Our stores offer a variety of installation services targeted at DIFM customers who purchase products and installation of those products from us in our stores, online or in their homes through in-home consultations. Our installation programs include many categories, such as flooring, cabinets, countertops, water heaters, and sheds. In addition, we provide professional installation in a number of categories sold through our in-home sales programs, such as roofing, siding, windows, kitchen and bath refacing, furnaces, and central air systems. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Professional Customers . These customers are primarily professional remodelers, general contractors, repairmen, small business owners and tradesmen. We recognize the unique service needs of the professional customer and use our expertise to facilitate their buying experience. We offer a variety of special programs to these customers, including delivery and will-call services, dedicated staff, expanded credit programs, designated parking spaces close to store entrances and bulk pricing programs for both online and in-store purchases. In addition, we maintain a ##TABLE_END 2 loyalty program, Pro Xtra, that provides our professional customers with discounts on useful business services, exclusive product offers and a purchase tracking tool to enable receipt lookup online and job tracking of purchases across all forms of payment. This program, introduced in fiscal 2013, continued to gain traction, with approximately 2.5 million customers enrolled by the end of fiscal 2014 . We help our DIY, DIFM and professional customers finance their projects by offering private label credit products in our stores through third-party credit providers. In fiscal 2014 , our customers opened approximately 2.9 million new The Home Depot private label credit accounts, and at fiscal year end the total number of The Home Depot active account holders was approximately 11 million. Private label credit card sales accounted for approximately 23% of sales in fiscal 2014 . Building Connectivity . In fiscal 2014 , we continued to enhance our customers' interconnected shopping experiences through a variety of initiatives. As noted above, we completed the first major upgrade of our FIRST Phone in-store mobile technology. Our new web-enabled handheld devices, which allow mobile checkout, give our associates a simple customer service tool for locating products, checking inventory on hand or simply explaining product features. These capabilities are especially important for our \"interconnected\" customers. Many of our customers research products online and then go into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate before making the purchase. While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews, compare prices or view our extended assortment. Our web-enabled FIRST Phones help our associates assist with the online experience when they encounter customers in the aisles. Approximately 10% of our online orders were created from inside our stores in fiscal 2014 . During fiscal 2014 , we also introduced a new mobile app that provides an enhanced in-store map and live chat feature, and we have found that our customers are using this mobile app inside our stores. We also recognize that customers desire greater visibility, control and options when it comes to receiving their products and services. In addition to our BOPIS, BOSS, and BODFS programs, during fiscal 2014 we developed several delivery enhancements for our customers. We began pilot programs to offer time-specific delivery of orders placed online or in the stores; improve and simplify the in-store experience for scheduling a delivery; and enable customers to self-schedule a delivery on our website. Time-specific delivery capability will be particularly beneficial to our professional customers, who need to ensure their orders are delivered to their job sites at the time that aligns with the project plan to avoid disruptions or delays. We also made enhancements to our special order and installation process in fiscal 2014 . First, we introduced our new Customer Order Management system, which is being rolled out to all U.S. stores. This system is designed to provide greater visibility into and improved execution of special orders by our associates and a more seamless experience for our customers. We also replaced our lead and purchase order management system with a single platform for our third-party installers. In addition to the new interface, installers have the option to integrate directly with our system through a secure data transmission. This system improves communications between installers and the stores and delivers a better customer experience. We also built better connectivity to reduce the time between a customer's initial inquiry for service and the service provider's contact with the customer, which makes it more likely that the customer will proceed with the project. Our Associates. Our associates are key to our customer service initiative. We empower our associates to deliver excellent customer service through our Customer FIRST training program, which includes enhanced training for our interconnected customers that stresses the importance of quick pickup of merchandise. We also have a number of programs to recognize stores and individual associates for exceptional customer and community service. At the end of fiscal 2014 , we employed approximately 371,000 associates, of whom approximately 23,000 were salaried, with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis. To attract and retain qualified personnel, we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve. We measure associate satisfaction regularly, and we believe that our employee relations are very good. Product Authority Our product authority initiative is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value. In fiscal 2014 , we continued to introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our professional, DIFM and DIY customers, while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online. Our Products. In fiscal 2014 , we introduced a number of innovative and distinctive products to our customers at attractive values. Examples of these new products include Behr Marquee  interior paint; EGO  56-volt lithium-ion 3-in-1 cordless lawn mower; Diablo  Pergo  blades from Freud  ; touchless toilets from Kohler  ; and the My Q Garage universal smartphone controller from Chamberlain  . 3 During fiscal 2014 , we offered a number of proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments, such as Husky  hand tools and tool storage; Defiant  door locks; Everbilt  hardware fasteners; Hampton Bay  lighting and fans; Vigoro  lawn care products; RIDGID  and Ryobi  power tools; Glacier Bay  bath fixtures; HDX  hardware, storage and cleaning products; Home Decorators Collection  furniture and home dcor; and CE Tech  audio-visual accessories. In fiscal 2014 , we acquired one of our principal fasteners suppliers, known as Crown Bolt, which provides sourcing, distribution and in-store servicing support for our Everbilt  and related fastener brands. We will continue to assess strategic alliances and relationships with suppliers and opportunities to expand the range of products available under brand names that are exclusive to The Home Depot. We maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality and innovative products directly from manufacturers around the world. In fiscal 2014 , in addition to our sourcing operations at our Store Support Center in Atlanta, Georgia, we maintained seven sourcing offices, located in Shanghai, China; Shenzhen, China; Taipei, Taiwan; Gurgaon, India; Rome, Italy; Monterrey, Mexico and Toronto, Canada. The percentage of Net Sales of each of our major product categories (and related services) for each of the last three fiscal years is presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements.\" Net Sales outside the U.S. were $8.5 billion , $8.5 billion and $8.4 billion for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Long-lived assets outside the U.S. totaled $2.5 billion , $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion as of February 1, 2015 , February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 , respectively. Quality Assurance . We have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to overseeing the quality of all of our products, whether they are directly imported, locally or globally sourced or proprietary branded products. Through these programs, we have established criteria for supplier and product performance that are designed to ensure that our products comply with applicable international, federal, state and local safety, quality and performance standards. We also have a Supplier Social and Environmental Responsibility Program designed to ensure that our suppliers adhere to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility. Building Connectivity . A typical The Home Depot store stocks approximately 30,000 to 40,000 products during the year, including both national brand name and proprietary items. To enhance our merchandising capabilities, we continued to make improvements to our information technology tools in fiscal 2014 to give our merchants and suppliers greater visibility into category and item performance and to better assort products within stores with similar attributes based on local preferences, regulations and demographics. We also continued to use the resources of BlackLocus, Inc., a data analytics and pricing firm we acquired in fiscal 2012, to help us make focused merchandising decisions based on large, complex data sets. We also use these analytics at a store-level to automate and optimize our markdown and clearance process. As noted above, our online properties complement our stores by serving as an extended aisle, and we offer a significantly broader product assortment through our Home Depot, Home Decorators Collection and Blinds.com websites. For our online user experience, we continued to enhance our websites and mobile sites by improving navigation and search functionalities to allow customers to more easily find and purchase an expanded array of products and provide them with flexibility and convenience for their purchases, for example, through our BOPIS, BOSS and BODFS programs and other delivery enhancements introduced in fiscal 2014. As a result of these efforts, we increased traffic to our websites, online sales conversion rates, and the number of orders being picked up in our stores. For fiscal 2014 , we had over 1.2 billion visits to our online properties; sales from our online channels increased over 36% compared to fiscal 2013; and almost 40% of our online orders were picked up in a store, compared to approximately 30% in fiscal 2013. Energy Saving Products and Programs. The Home Depot has a long-standing commitment to sustainability, as do many of our customers, and we believe our efforts have been successful in creating value for our customers and shareholders. For example, we offer a growing selection of environmentally-preferred products, which supports sustainability and helps our customers save money, energy and water. Through our Eco Options  Program introduced in 2007, we have created product categories that allow consumers to easily identify products that meet specifications for energy efficiency, water conservation, healthy home, clean air and sustainable forestry. As of the end of fiscal 2014 , our Eco Options  Program included over 9,000 products. Through this program, we sell products such as ENERGY STAR  certified appliances, compact fluorescent light (\"CFL\") and LED light bulbs, tankless water heaters and other products, enabling our customers to save on their utility bills. We estimate that in fiscal 2014 we helped consumers save over $630 million in electricity costs through sales of ENERGY STAR  certified products as well as almost 48 billion gallons of water and over $400 million in water bills through the sales of WaterSense  -labeled bath faucets, showerheads, aerators, toilets and irrigation controllers. Additionally, as a result of converting all of our consumer interior paints to \"Low VOC\" or \"Zero VOC\" in fiscal 2012, we have eliminated over 55 million pounds of volatile organic compound emissions since the beginning of fiscal 2012 through the end of fiscal 2014 . 4 We also continue to use the Eco Options  page on our website to reach consumers interested in environmentally responsible and cost-saving products and projects. The site provides consumers with information on the benefits of environmentally-preferred Eco Options  products through \"green\" blogs, articles and projects, featured Eco Options  products and energy and water savings calculators to help consumers estimate potential savings by switching out their older, less efficient products with energy- and water-saving models. We also support sustainability through our recycling efforts. We continue to offer our nationwide, in-store CFL bulb recycling program launched in 2008. This service is offered to customers free of charge and is available in all U.S. stores. We also maintain an in-store rechargeable battery recycling program. Launched in 2001 and currently done in partnership with Call2Recycle, this program is also available to customers free of charge in all stores throughout the U.S. Through these recycling programs, in fiscal 2014 we helped recycle over 725,000 pounds of CFL bulbs and over 940,000 pounds of rechargeable batteries collected from our customers. In fiscal 2014 , we also recycled over 107,000 lead acid batteries collected from our customers under our lead acid battery exchange program, as well as over 200,000 tons of cardboard through a nationwide cardboard recycling program across our U.S. stores. We believe our Eco Options programs and our recycling efforts drive sales, which in turn benefits our shareholders, in addition to our customers and the environment. Seasonality. Our business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, and the lowest volume occurs during our fourth fiscal quarter. Competition. Our industry is highly competitive, with competition based primarily on customer service, price, store location and appearance, and quality, availability and assortment of merchandise. Although we are currently the worlds largest home improvement retailer, in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses, and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and, to a lesser extent, other retailers, as well as with installers of home improvement products. In addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers, some of whom have a lower cost structure than ours, as our customers increasingly use computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products. Intellectual Property. Our business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, e-commerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business, including our expanding proprietary brands such as HDX  , Husky  , Hampton Bay  , Home Decorators Collection  , Glacier Bay  and Vigoro  . We also maintain patent portfolios relating to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our products or business operations. Disciplined Capital Allocation, Productivity and Efficiency We have advanced this initiative through building best-in-class competitive advantages in our information technology and supply chain to better ensure product availability to our customers while managing our costs. During fiscal 2014 , we continued to focus on optimizing our supply chain network and improving our inventory, transportation and distribution productivity. Logistics. Our supply chain operations are focused on creating a competitive advantage through ensuring product availability for our customers, effectively using our investment in inventory, and managing total supply chain costs. Our fiscal 2014 initiatives have been to further optimize and efficiently operate our network, build new logistics capabilities and improve our inventory management systems and processes by investing in information technology. Our distribution strategy is to provide the optimal flow path for a given product. Rapid Deployment Centers (\"RDCs\") play a key role in optimizing our network as they allow for aggregation of product needs for multiple stores to a single purchase order and then rapid allocation and deployment of inventory to individual stores upon arrival at the RDC. This results in a simplified ordering process and improved transportation and inventory management. We have 18 mechanized RDCs in the U.S., and we opened our first RDC in Canada in early 2014 , with a second Canadian RDC scheduled to open in the second half of fiscal 2015. We also continued our U.S. transload program for imported products in four facilities operated by third parties near ocean ports. Transload facilities allow us to improve our import logistics costs and inventory management by postponing final inventory deployment decisions until product arrives at destination ports. Over the past several years, we have centralized our inventory planning and replenishment function and continuously improved our forecasting and replenishment technology. This has helped us to improve our product availability and our 5 inventory productivity at the same time. At the end of fiscal 2014 , over 95% of our U.S. store products were ordered through central inventory management. In addition to our RDCs and transload facilities, at the end of fiscal 2014 , we operated 34 bulk distribution centers, which handle products distributed optimally on flat bed trucks, in the U.S. and Canada; 21 stocking distribution centers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico; and ten specialty distribution centers, which include offshore consolidation and return logistics centers, in the U.S. and Canada. We remain committed to leveraging our supply chain capabilities to fully utilize and optimize our improved logistics network. For example, we have begun to flow a portion of our BOSS orders through our RDCs, which reduces our transportation costs for those orders. Building Connectivity. We also believe that using our almost 2,000 U.S. stores as a network of convenient locations for our customers who shop online and use our BOPIS, BOSS and BORIS programs provides us with a competitive advantage. As noted above, in fiscal 2014 , we started a pilot for BODFS, which will give us the capability to deliver orders placed online from our stores to the customer's home or job site. In addition, we added capacity for the more traditional online direct-to-customer delivery methods in fiscal 2014 . We opened two new direct fulfillment centers in Georgia and California, which brings our total to four direct fulfillment center operations in the U.S., and another facility is scheduled to open in the second half of fiscal 2015. These facilities will support our online growth with a balance of cost efficiency and speed in shipping online orders to meet our customers' needs. We expect these facilities to provide us the capability to deliver 90% of our customers' parcel orders in the U.S. within two days. Commitment to Environmentally Responsible Operations . The Home Depot is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner. This commitment impacts all areas of our business, including energy usage, supply chain, store construction and maintenance, and, as noted above under \"Energy Saving Products and Programs,\" product selection and delivery of product knowledge to our customers. In fiscal 2014 , our energy management team continued to implement strict operational standards that establish energy efficient practices in all of our U.S. facilities. These include HVAC unit temperature regulation and adherence to strict lighting schedules, which are the largest sources of energy consumption in our stores, as well as use of energy management systems in each store to monitor energy efficiency. We estimate that by implementing and utilizing these energy saving programs, we have saved over 8.6 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) since 2004. We set a goal to reduce our kWh per square foot in our U.S. stores by 20% by 2015. We met that goal in fiscal 2013, well in advance of our targeted date, and estimate a reduction of almost 32% as of the end of fiscal 2014 . Through our supply chain efficiencies described above under \"Logistics,\" we targeted a 20% reduction in our domestic supply chain greenhouse gas emissions from 2008 to 2015. We also continued to monitor our \"carbon footprint\" from the operation of our stores as well as from our transportation and supply chain activities. Through our supply chain and energy reduction initiatives, we have exceeded our goal by reducing our absolute carbon emissions by over 1.9 million metric tons from 2008 to 2013, including the reduction of over 125,000 metric tons in 2013. At our stores, we implemented a rainwater reclamation project in 2010. As of the end of fiscal 2014 , we had retrofitted 150 of our stores with reclamation tanks to collect rainwater and condensation from HVAC units and garden center roofs, which is in turn used to water plants in our outside garden centers. We estimate our annual water savings from these units to be approximately 500,000 gallons per retrofitted store in fiscal 2014 . Our efforts have resulted in a number of environmental awards and recognitions. For example, in 2014, we received three significant awards from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"). We were named \"Retail Partner of the Year\" by both the ENERGY STAR  division and WaterSense  division of the EPA for our overall excellence in energy efficiency and water efficiency, and we received the EPA's \"SmartWay Excellence Award,\" which recognizes The Home Depot as an industry leader in freight supply chain environmental performance and energy efficiency. We also participate in the CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) reporting process. CDP is an independent, international, not-for-profit organization providing a global system for companies and cities to measure, disclose, manage and share environmental information. In 2014, we scored 93 out of 100 from the CDP for our disclosure, placing us among the highest scoring retailers and in the top quartile of our sector. We also received a performance band ranking of A- (out of a range from A to E), reflecting a high level of action on climate change mitigation, adaptation and transparency. We are strongly committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates and protecting the environment of the communities in which we do business. Our Environmental, Health  Safety (\"EHS\") function is dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of our customers and associates, with trained associates who evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a Company-wide basis. Our EHS policies are woven 6 into our everyday operations and are part of The Home Depot culture. Some common program elements include: daily store inspection checklists (by department); routine follow-up audits from our store-based safety team members and regional, district and store operations field teams; equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety; departmental merchandising safety standards; training and education programs for all associates, with varying degrees of training provided based on an associate's role and responsibilities; and awareness, communication and recognition programs designed to drive operational awareness and understanding of EHS issues. Returning Value to Shareholders . In addition to making disciplined decisions about capital allocation, we maintained our focus on expense control, which drove higher returns on invested capital and allowed us to return value to shareholders through $7.0 billion in share repurchases and $2.5 billion in dividends in fiscal 2014, as discussed in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. The risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. You should read these Risk Factors in conjunction with \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item 7 and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item 8. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. We operate in markets that are highly competitive. We compete principally based on customer service, price, store location and appearance, and quality, availability and assortment of merchandise. In each market we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and, to a lesser extent, other retailers, as well as with installers of home improvement products. In addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers, some of whom have a lower cost structure than ours, as our customers increasingly use computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products in real time. Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect our prices, our margins or demand for our products and services. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through maintenance of superior customer service and customer relationships, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; consumer preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions, while also managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining high levels of customer service. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. As the housing and home improvement market continues to recover, resulting changes in demand will put further pressure on our ability to meet customer needs and expectations and maintain high service levels. In addition, each of our primary customer groups  DIY, DIFM and professionals  have different needs and expectations. If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers. Customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also evolving. Customers are increasingly using technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices and to purchase products. Once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products. We must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. We have implemented programs like BOSS and BOPIS, and are piloting BODFS, but we cannot guarantee that these programs or others we may implement will be implemented successfully or will meet customers needs and expectations. Customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our Company and products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. To the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media, it may impact our brand and reputation. 7 Further, we have an aging store base that requires maintenance and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping environment that our customers desire. Failure to maintain our stores and utilize our store space effectively, to provide a compelling online presence, to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs and to differentiate the customer service experience for our three primary customer groups could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs. Our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, or healthcare benefits. In addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly if the economy continues to improve and employment opportunities increase. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. We discovered a data breach in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and are still in the process of determining the full extent of its impact and the impact of related government investigations and civil litigation on our results of operations, which could be material. Our recent Data Breach involved the theft of certain payment card information and customer email addresses through unauthorized access to our systems. As a result of the Data Breach, we are facing at least 57 civil lawsuits filed in the U.S. and Canada, and other claims may be asserted on behalf of customers, payment card brands, payment card issuing banks, shareholders, or others seeking damages or other related relief, allegedly arising out of the Data Breach. We are also facing investigations by a number of state and federal agencies. Our financial liability arising from these claims and investigations will depend on many factors, one of which is whether, at the time of the Data Breach, the portion of our network that handles payment card data was in compliance with applicable payment card industry standards. Another factor is whether, and if so to what extent, any fraud losses or other expenses experienced by cardholders, the payment card networks or the card issuing banks on or with respect to the payment card accounts affected by the Data Breach can be properly attributed to the Data Breach and whether and to what extent those losses and expenses would in any event be our legal responsibility. These claims and investigations may adversely affect how we operate our business, divert the attention of management from the operation of the business and result in additional costs and fines. In addition, the governmental agencies investigating the Data Breach may seek to impose injunctive relief, which could materially increase our data security costs, adversely impact how we operate our systems and collect and use customer information, and put us at a competitive disadvantage with other retailers. Investigations of the Data Breach are ongoing, and we are still in the process of assessing the financial and other impacts of the Data Breach. It is possible that we will identify additional information that was accessed or stolen, or other unforeseen developments related to the Data Breach could occur, which could have a further adverse impact on our operations, financial results and reputation. If our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier or Company information are not successful, we could incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to further litigation, enforcement actions, and reputational damage. Our business, like that of most retailers, involves the receipt, storage and transmission of customers' personal information, consumer preferences and payment card information, as well as confidential information about our associates, our suppliers and our Company, some of which is entrusted to third-party service providers and vendors. We also work with third-party service providers and vendors that provide technology, systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of this information. Our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third-party service providers or vendors. Hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. The methods used to 8 obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. We have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss. However, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. Any future significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or Company data, could result in additional significant costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs. We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, PayPal, our private label credit cards and installment loan program, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult or costly. The payment card industry has set October 1, 2015 as the date on which it will shift liability for certain transactions to retailers who are not able to accept EMV chip card credit and debit transactions. To be able to accept all forms of EMV card transactions by the target date, we are reliant on various third parties to establish the standard for such transactions, develop and test the required software, define the applicable certification standards, and certify compliance with those standards. The failure of these third parties to timely complete and deliver needed elements, or our failure to effectively and timely implement those elements once received, will impact our ability to be able to accept all types of EMV card transactions by the target date, which could in turn result in increased costs associated with the liability shift. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems, as reflected in our recent Data Breach. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. As a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Uncertainty regarding economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. Our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. Adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets or the economy could adversely impact consumer confidence, causing our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services. Other factors beyond our control  including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures; interest rate fluctuations; fuel and other energy costs; labor and healthcare costs; the availability of financing; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; weather; natural disasters and other conditions beyond our control  could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. A failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to analyze, process, manage and protect transactions and data. We also rely heavily on the integrity of, security of and consistent access to this data in managing our business. For these systems and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must periodically maintain and update them. Our systems and the third-party systems we rely on are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power outages; computer and telecommunications failures; 9 computer viruses; security breaches; cyber-attacks; catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, or hurricanes; acts of war or terrorism; and design or usage errors by our associates, contractors or third-party service providers. Although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, we may not be successful in doing so. As a result, we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. Disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. Through our information technology developments, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and a multichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices. We use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales. We have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. Multichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments. Disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. We rely on third-party suppliers. If we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our current suppliers experience financial difficulties, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. We buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by political instability, military conflict, the financial instability of suppliers (particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the world), suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, any disruptions in our suppliers logistics or supply chain networks, and other factors beyond our or our suppliers control. Disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. A disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation. Such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers; weather-related events; natural disasters; trade restrictions; tariffs; third-party strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns; shipping capacity constraints; supply or shipping interruptions or costs; or other factors beyond our control. Any such disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. If we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. As part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. We have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. Our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our business. If we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results. Our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks. As we expand our proprietary product offerings, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products, including greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements and increased potential product liability and product recall exposure. To effectively 10 execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our vendors' products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our vendors. Any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. We have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology. These initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience. The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. In addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits and reputational damage. We act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our DIFM customers through third-party installers. As such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of our third-party installers. We have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. If we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. Recently, there have been a large number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms, as well as expanded enforcement of existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. Changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements, other wage, labor or workplace regulations, cybersecurity and data privacy, the sale of some of our products, transportation, logistics, supply chain transparency, taxes, energy costs or environmental matters could increase our costs of doing business or impact our store operations. In addition, recent healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates. If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profit margins may be impacted. Our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our U.S. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. Our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations and other legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political and economic conditions. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences, greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights, risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery law compliance, and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our sales and profit margins. The inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. Prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market 11 speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. In addition to the matters discussed above with respect to the Data Breach, we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive verdicts. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of managements attention and resources from other matters. ", "1B": " Item 1B.

At the end of fiscal 2014 , we operated 162 warehouses and distribution centers located in 35 states or provinces, consisting of approximately 42.5 million square feet, of which approximately 1.2 million is owned and approximately 41.3 million is leased. Our executive, corporate staff, divisional staff and financial offices occupy approximately 2.1 million square feet of leased and owned space in Atlanta, Georgia. At the end of fiscal 2014 including the offices in Atlanta, we occupied an aggregate of approximately 3.3 million square feet, of which approximately 2.1 million is owned and approximately 1.2 million is leased, for store support centers and customer support centers. 14 ", "3": " Item 3. Legal Proceedings. For a description of the litigation and government inquiries related to the Data Breach we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, see Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements,\" which description is incorporated herein by reference.

The Company is cooperating with the District Attorneys and Attorney General's office. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding, it does not expect the outcome to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2014, the New York Attorney Generals Office notified the Company of alleged noncompliance with state laws related to the in-store display of certain lawn fertilizer products.

The number and average price of shares purchased in each fiscal month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 are set forth in the table below:  ##TABLE_START Period Total Number of Shares Purchased (1)  Average Price Paid Per Share (1)  Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Program (2)  Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Program (2) Nov. 3, 2014  Nov. 30, 2014 1,477,359  $ 98.20  1,463,956  $ 2,613,513,610 Dec. 1, 2014  Dec. 28, 2014 5,120,208  $ 100.37  5,116,351  $ 2,099,998,678 Dec. 29, 2014  Feb. 1, 2015 5,770,925  $ 104.07  5,765,202  $ 1,499,998,756  12,368,492  $ 101.84  12,345,509  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) These amounts include repurchases pursuant to the Companys 1997 and Amended and Restated 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plans (the \"Plans\"). Under the Plans, participants may surrender shares as payment of applicable tax withholding on the vesting of restricted stock and deferred share awards. Participants in the Plans may also exercise stock options by surrendering shares of common stock that the participants already own as payment of the exercise price. Shares so surrendered by participants in the Plans are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the Plans and applicable award agreement and not pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the Board of Directors authorized a $17.0 billion share repurchase program, of which approximately $1.5 billion remained available at the end of fiscal 2014. In February 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a new $18.0 billion share repurchase program that replaces the previous authorization. This new program does not have a prescribed expiration date. ##TABLE_END In March 2015, the Company entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (\"ASR\") agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $850 million of the Company's common stock. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Shares received in connection with the ASR agreement will be reflected in the share repurchase table in future quarters. Sales of Unregistered Securities During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 , the Company issued 431 deferred stock units under The Home Depot, Inc. Non-Employee Directors' Deferred Stock Compensation Plan pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") and Rule 506 of the SEC's Regulation D thereunder. The deferred stock units were credited to the accounts of those non-employee directors who elected to receive board retainers in the form of deferred stock units instead of cash during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 . The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 , the Company credited 20,724 deferred stock units to participant accounts under The Home Depot FutureBuilder Restoration Plan pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for involuntary, non-contributory plans. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan.  ", "6": " Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to page F-1 of this report. 17 ", "7": " Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Executive Summary and Selected Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data For the fiscal year ended February 1, 2015 (\"fiscal 2014 \"), we reported Net Earnings of $ 6.3 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $ 4.71 compared to Net Earnings of $ 5.4 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $ 3.76 for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2014 (\"fiscal 2013 \"). The results for fiscal 2014 included $33 million of pretax net expenses related to a breach of our payment data systems (the \"Data Breach\"). The results for fiscal 2014 also included a $323 million pretax gain related to the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in HD Supply Holdings, Inc. (\"HD Supply\"). Net Sales increased 5.5% to $ 83.2 billion for fiscal 2014 from $ 78.8 billion for fiscal 2013 . Our total comparable store sales increased 5.3% in fiscal 2014 , driven by a 3.5% increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 1.8% increase in our comparable store average ticket. Comparable store sales for our U.S. stores increased 6.1% in fiscal 2014 . Data Breach In the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we confirmed that our payment data systems were breached, which potentially impacted customers who used payment cards at self-checkout systems in our U.S. and Canadian stores. Our investigation to date has determined the intruder used a vendors user name and password to enter the perimeter of our network. The intruder then acquired elevated rights that allowed it to navigate portions of our systems and to deploy unique, custom-built malware on our self-checkout systems to access payment card information of up to 56 million customers who shopped at our U.S. and Canadian stores between April 2014 and September 2014. On September 18, 2014, we confirmed that the malware used in the Data Breach had been eliminated from our systems. There is no evidence that debit PIN numbers were compromised or that the Data Breach impacted stores in Mexico or customers who shopped online at HomeDepot.com or HomeDepot.ca. In addition, we announced on November 6, 2014 that separate files containing approximately 53 million email addresses were also taken during the Data Breach. These files did not contain passwords, payment card information or other sensitive personal information. The investigation of the Data Breach is ongoing, and we are supporting law enforcement efforts to identify the responsible parties. In September 2014, we completed a major payment security project that provides enhanced encryption of payment card data at the point of sale in all of our U.S. stores, offering significant new protection for customers. The new security protection takes raw payment card information and scrambles it to make it unreadable to unauthorized users. We are also rolling out enhanced encryption to our Canadian stores and EMV chip-and-PIN technology in our U.S. stores, which will add extra layers of payment card protection for customers who use EMV enabled chip-and-PIN cards. Our Canadian stores are already enabled with EMV chip-and-PIN technology. Expenses Incurred In fiscal 2014, we recorded $63 million of pretax expenses related to the Data Breach, partially offset by $30 million of expected insurance proceeds for costs we believe are reimbursable and probable of recovery under our insurance coverage, for pretax net expenses of $33 million . These expenses are included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2014. Expenses include costs to investigate the Data Breach; provide identity protection services, including credit monitoring, to impacted customers; increase call center staffing; and pay legal and other professional services, all of which were expensed as incurred. Litigation, Claims and Government Investigations In addition to the above expenses, we believe it is probable that the payment card networks will make claims against us. The ultimate amount of these claims will likely include amounts for incremental counterfeit fraud losses and non-ordinary course operating expenses (such as card reissuance costs) that the payment card networks assert they or their issuing banks have incurred. In order for us to have liability for such claims, we believe it would have to be determined, among other things, that (1) at the time of the Data Breach the portion of our network that handles payment card data was noncompliant with applicable data security standards, and (2) the alleged noncompliance caused at least some portion of the compromise of payment card data that occurred during the Data Breach. Although an independent third-party assessor found the portion of our network that handles payment card data to be compliant with applicable data security standards in the fall of 2013, and the process of obtaining such certification for 2014 was ongoing at the time of the Data Breach, in March 2015 the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card networks alleged that we were not in compliance with certain of those standards at the time of the Data Breach. As a result, we believe it is probable that the payment card networks will make claims against us and that we will dispute those claims. When those claims are asserted, we will have to determine, based on the facts and information then available to us, whether to litigate or seek to settle those claims. At this time, we believe that settlement negotiations will ensue and that it is probable that we will incur a loss in connection with those claims. We cannot 18 reasonably estimate a range of losses because no claims have yet been asserted and because there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. We will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. We believe that the ultimate amount paid on payment card network claims could be material to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in future periods. In addition, at least 57 actions have been filed in courts in the U.S. and Canada, and other claims may be asserted against us on behalf of customers, payment card brands, payment card issuing banks, shareholders or others seeking damages or other related relief, allegedly arising from the Data Breach. Furthermore, several state and federal agencies, including State Attorneys General, are investigating events related to the Data Breach, including how it occurred, its consequences and our responses. We are cooperating in the governmental investigations, and we may be subject to fines or other obligations. While a loss from these matters is reasonably possible, we are not able to estimate the costs, or range of costs, related to these matters because the proceedings remain in the early stages, alleged damages have not been specified, there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. We have not concluded that a loss from these matters is probable; therefore, we have not recorded an accrual for litigation, claims and governmental investigations related to these matters in fiscal 2014. We will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. We believe that the ultimate amount paid on these actions, claims and investigations could be material to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in future periods. Future Costs We expect to incur significant legal and other professional services expenses associated with the Data Breach in future periods. We will recognize these expenses as services are received. Costs related to the Data Breach that may be incurred in future periods may also include liabilities to payment card networks for reimbursements of credit card fraud and card reissuance costs; liabilities related to our private label credit card fraud and card reissuance costs; liabilities from current and future civil litigation, governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings; future expenses for legal, investigative and consulting fees; and incremental expenses and capital investments for remediation activities. We believe that the ultimate amount paid on these services and claims could be material to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in future periods. Insurance Coverage We maintained $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage in fiscal 2014, above a $7.5 million deductible, to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the Data Breach. As of February 1, 2015 , we had received an initial payment of $10 million of insurance reimbursements. In fiscal 2015, we entered into a new policy, with $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage, above a $10 million deductible, to limit our exposure to similar losses. Key Initiatives In fiscal 2014 , we continued to focus on the following key initiatives: Customer Service  Our customer service initiative is anchored on the principles of simplifying the business, creating an emotional connection with customers, putting customers first and taking care of our associates. In fiscal 2014, we completed the rollout of our second generation FIRST phone, a handheld mobile customer service tool used by our store associates. The latest FIRST phone generation provides a more intuitive smartphone interface, internet access to convert online sales in the aisle, integrated mobile checkout and greatly improved overall processing speed. Product Authority  Our product authority initiative is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value. In fiscal 2014 , we continued to introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our professional, do-it-for-me and do-it-yourself customers, while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online. Using our new merchandising assortment planning and pricing tools in fiscal 2014, we reviewed approximately one-third of the products offered in a typical store, allowing us to better match our assortments to local customer preferences, regulations and demographics. We also used these tools to help us make other focused merchandising decisions, including decisions regarding our markdown and clearance process. 19 Disciplined Capital Allocation, Productivity and Efficiency  Our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through continuous operational improvement in the stores and our supply chain, disciplined capital allocation and building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased a total of 80 million shares for $7.0 billion through Accelerated Share Repurchase (\"ASR\") agreements and the open market during fiscal 2014 . In addition, in February 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a new $18.0 billion share repurchase program that replaces the previous authorization, and we announced a 26% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.59 per share. In January 2015, we acquired HD Supply Hardware Solutions, known as Crown Bolt, a leading supplier of fasteners and builders hardware to retailers in the U.S. We expect this acquisition to further enhance our supply chain capabilities and product offerings in hardware. In fiscal 2014 , we opened six new stores in Mexico, including one relocation, and opened one new store in Canada, for a total store count of 2,269 at the end of fiscal 2014 . As of the end of fiscal 2014 , a total of 292 of our stores, or 12.9% , were located in Canada and Mexico. We generated $8.2 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2014 . This cash flow, along with $2.0 billion of long-term debt issued in fiscal 2014 and cash on hand, was used to fund $7.0 billion of share repurchases, pay $2.5 billion of dividends, fund $1.4 billion in capital expenditures, and pay for the acquisition of HD Supply Hardware Solutions. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.7 times at the end of fiscal 2014 compared to 4.6 times at the end of fiscal 2013 . Our return on invested capital (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 24.9% for fiscal 2014 compared to 20.9% for fiscal 2013 . Interconnected Retail  Our focus on interconnected retail, which connects our other three key initiatives, is based on building a competitive and seamless platform across all commerce channels. In fiscal 2014 , we continued to enhance our website and mobile experience, resulting in increased traffic to our websites, increased online sales conversion rates and an increase in the number of orders being picked up in our stores. Almost 40% of our online orders are picked up in our stores through our Buy Online, Pick-up In Store (\"BOPIS\") and Buy Online, Ship to Store (\"BOSS\") programs. Additionally, we improved navigation, enhanced search capabilities and expanded chat functionality across our online platforms. Sales from our online channels increased 36.9% for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 and represented approximately 4.5% of our total Net Sales for fiscal 2014 . In fiscal 2014, we started a pilot for Buy Online, Deliver From Store (\"BODFS\"), which complements our existing BOPIS and BOSS interconnected retail programs. Further, we opened two of three planned direct fulfillment centers in fiscal 2014 and plan to open the third direct fulfillment center in the second half of fiscal 2015. These highly automated facilities will support our online growth by providing a balance of cost efficiency and speed in shipping online orders to meet our customers' needs. 20 We believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations.  ##TABLE_START  % of Net Sales  % Increase (Decrease) In Dollar Amounts  Fiscal Year (1)     vs. 2013  vs. 2012 NET SALES 100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 %  5.5 %  5.4 % GROSS PROFIT 34.8  34.8  34.6  5.7  6.0 Operating Expenses:          Selling, General and Administrative 20.2  21.1  22.1  1.4  0.5 Depreciation and Amortization 2.0  2.1  2.1  1.5  3.8 Total Operating Expenses 22.2  23.1  24.2  1.4  0.8 OPERATING INCOME 12.6  11.6  10.4  14.2  18.0 Interest and Other (Income) Expense:          Interest and Investment Income (0.4 )      N/M  (40.0 ) Interest Expense 1.0  0.9  0.8  16.7  12.5 Other     (0.1 )  N/A  (100.0 ) Interest and Other, net 0.6  0.9  0.7  (29.5 )  28.3 EARNINGS BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 12.0  10.7  9.7  17.8  17.3 Provision for Income Taxes 4.4  3.9  3.6  17.8  14.7 NET EARNINGS 7.6 %  6.8 %  6.1 %  17.8 %  18.7 % SELECTED SALES DATA          Number of Customer Transactions (in millions) (2) 1,441.6  1,390.6  1,364.0  3.7 %  1.9 % Average Ticket (2) $ 57.87  $ 56.78  $ 54.89  1.9 %  3.4 % Sales per Square Foot (2) $ 352.22  $ 334.35  $ 318.63  5.3 %  4.9 % Comparable Store Sales Increase (%) (3) 5.3 %  6.8 %  4.6 %  N/A  N/A Online Sales (% of Net Sales) (4) 4.5 %  3.5 %  2.4 %  36.9 %  52.6 % ##TABLE_ENDNote: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding.   ##TABLE_START (1) Fiscal years 2014 , 2013 and 2012 refer to the fiscal years ended February 1, 2015 , February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 , respectively.

Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  Net Sales Net Sales for fiscal 2014  increased  5.5% to $83.2 billion from $78.8 billion for fiscal 2013 . The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2014 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth. Total comparable store sales increased 5.3% for fiscal 2014 on top of an increase of 6.8% for fiscal 2013 . The positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2014 reflect a number of factors, including the execution of our key initiatives, continued strength in our maintenance and repair categories, and an improved U.S. home improvement market. All of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2014 . Comparable store sales for our Tools, Millwork, Kitchen, Bath, Dcor, Plumbing, Electrical, Lighting and Hardware product categories were above or at the Company average for fiscal 2014 . Further, our comparable store customer transactions increased 3.5% for fiscal 2014 and comparable store average ticket increased 1.8% for fiscal 2014, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases, such as appliances and water heaters, and sales growth in our services business. Gross Profit Gross Profit increased  5.7% to $29.0 billion for fiscal 2014 from $27.4 billion for fiscal 2013 . Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.8% for both fiscal 2014 and 2013 . Gross profit margin for fiscal 2014 was similar to gross profit margin for fiscal 2013 due to benefits from changes in the mix of products sold and productivity in our supply chain, partially offset by higher shrink. Operating Expenses Selling, General and Administrative expenses (\"SGA\") increased  1.4% to $16.8 billion for fiscal 2014 from $16.6 billion for fiscal 2013 . SGA for fiscal 2014 included $63 million of pretax expenses related to the Data Breach, partially offset by a $30 million receivable for costs we believe are reimbursable and probable of recovery under our insurance coverage, for pretax net expenses of $33 million. As a percent of Net Sales, SGA was 20.2% for fiscal 2014 compared to 21.1% for fiscal 2013 . The decrease in SGA as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2014 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment and strong expense controls, partially offset by expenses related to the Data Breach. Depreciation and Amortization increased 1.5% to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2014 from $1.6 billion for fiscal 2013 . Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.0% for fiscal 2014 compared to 2.1% for fiscal 2013 . The decrease in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2014 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment. Operating Income Operating Income increased  14.2% to $10.5 billion for fiscal 2014 from $9.2 billion for fiscal 2013 . Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 12.6% for fiscal 2014 compared to 11.6% for fiscal 2013 . Interest and Other, net In fiscal 2014 , we recognized $493 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $699 million for fiscal 2013 . Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.6% for fiscal 2014 compared to 0.9% for fiscal 2013 . Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2014 included a $323 million pretax gain related to the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in HD Supply. This was partially offset by additional interest expense associated with $2.0 billion of long-term debt issued in June 2014. Provision for Income Taxes Our combined effective income tax rate was 36.4% for both fiscal 2014 and 2013 . Diluted Earnings per Share Diluted Earnings per Share were $4.71 for fiscal 2014 compared to $3.76 for fiscal 2013 . Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2014 reflect $0.15 of benefit from the gain related to the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in HD Supply and a negative impact of $0.02 for expenses incurred in connection with the Data Breach. 22 Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Net Sales Fiscal 2013 consisted of 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2012. Net Sales for fiscal 2013 increased 5.4% to $78.8 billion from $74.8 billion for fiscal 2012. The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2013 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2013, partially offset by $1.2 billion of Net Sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2012. Total comparable store sales increased 6.8% for fiscal 2013 on top of an increase of 4.6% for fiscal 2012. The positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2013 reflect a number of factors, including the execution of our key initiatives, continued strength in our core categories and an improved U.S. housing market. All of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2013. Comparable store sales for our Kitchen, Electrical, Lumber, Plumbing, Lighting, Bath and Indoor Garden product categories were above or at the Company average for fiscal 2013. Further, our comparable store customer transactions increased approximately 3.4% for fiscal 2013 and comparable store average ticket increased approximately 3.3% for fiscal 2013 due in part to strong sales in our appliance business and continued recovery in sales to our professional customers. Gross Profit Gross Profit increased 6.0% to $27.4 billion for fiscal 2013 from $25.8 billion for fiscal 2012. Gross Profit for fiscal 2012 included a $10 million charge related to the closing of our remaining seven big box stores in China (\"China store closings\") in fiscal 2012. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 34.8% for fiscal 2013 compared to 34.6% for fiscal 2012, an increase of 18 basis points. The increase in gross profit margin in fiscal 2013 was driven primarily by businesses we acquired in fiscal 2012, which are gross margin accretive, higher productivity in our supply chain and improved shrink performance, partially offset by a change in the mix of products sold. Operating Expenses SGA increased 0.5% to $16.6 billion for fiscal 2013 from $16.5 billion for fiscal 2012. SGA for fiscal 2012 included a $135 million charge related to the China store closings. As a percent of Net Sales, SGA was 21.1% for fiscal 2013 compared to 22.1% for fiscal 2012. The decrease in SGA as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2013 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment and strong expense controls. Depreciation and Amortization was $1.6 billion for both fiscal 2013 and 2012. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.1% for both fiscal 2013 and 2012. Operating Income Operating Income increased 18.0% to $9.2 billion for fiscal 2013 from $7.8 billion for fiscal 2012. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 11.6% for fiscal 2013 compared to 10.4% for fiscal 2012. Interest and Other, net In fiscal 2013, we recognized $699 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $545 million for fiscal 2012. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.9% for fiscal 2013 compared to 0.7% for fiscal 2012. The increase in Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2013 reflects increased interest expense associated with the issuance of $4.0 billion of incremental long-term debt in fiscal 2013. Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2012 included a $67 million pretax benefit related to the termination of our guarantee of a senior secured loan of HD Supply, Inc. Provision for Income Taxes Our combined effective income tax rate was 36.4% for fiscal 2013 compared to 37.2% for fiscal 2012. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 was higher than fiscal 2013 as we were unable to realize any tax benefit from the $145 million charge related to the China store closings for fiscal 2012. Excluding the charge related to the China store closings, our combined effective income tax rate was 36.5% for fiscal 2012. Diluted Earnings per Share Diluted Earnings per Share were $3.76 for fiscal 2013 compared to $3.00 for fiscal 2012. The China store closings had a negative impact of $0.10 to Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2012. The 53 rd week increased Diluted Earnings per Share by approximately $0.07 for fiscal 2012. 23 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. For fiscal 2014 , Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, excluding a $323 million gain on the sale of HD Supply common stock, was $ 8.2 billion compared to $ 7.6 billion for fiscal 2013 . This increase was primarily due to a $960 million  increase in Net Earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense leverage. The gain on the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in HD Supply is classified as an investing activity in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities for fiscal 2014 was $ 1.3 billion compared to $ 1.5 billion for fiscal 2013 . This change was primarily due to the $323 million of proceeds from the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in HD Supply in fiscal 2014 , partially offset by $53 million more in Capital Expenditures and $40 million less in Proceeds from Sales of Property and Equipment in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities for fiscal 2014 was $7.1 billion compared to $ 6.7 billion for fiscal 2013 . This change was primarily the result of $2.0 billion less of net proceeds from long-term borrowings, partially offset by $1.5 billion less in repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2014, we entered into ASR agreements with third-party financial institutions to repurchase $2.7 billion of our common stock. Under the agreements, we paid $2.7 billion to the financial institutions and received a total of 34 million shares in fiscal 2014. Also in fiscal 2014 , we repurchased 46 million additional shares of our common stock for $4.3 billion through the open market. Since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in 2002, we have repurchased 1.2 billion shares of our common stock for a total of $53.1 billion as of the end of fiscal 2014 . In February 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a new $18.0 billion share repurchase program that replaces the previous authorization. In June 2014, we issued $1.0 billion of 2.00% senior notes due June 15, 2019 (the \"2019 notes\") at a discount of $4 million and $1.0 billion of 4.40% senior notes due March 15, 2045 (the \"2045 notes\") at a discount of $15 million (together, the \"June 2014 issuance\"). Interest on the 2019 notes is due semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2014. Interest on the 2045 notes is due semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2014. The net proceeds of the June 2014 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock. In September 2013, we issued $1.15 billion of 2.25% senior notes due September 10, 2018 (the \"2018 notes\") at a discount of $1 million, $1.1 billion of 3.75% senior notes due February 15, 2024 (the \"2024 notes\") at a discount of $6 million and $1.0 billion of 4.875% senior notes due February 15, 2044 (the \"2044 notes\") at a discount of $15 million (together, the \"September 2013 issuance\"). Interest on the 2018 notes is due semi-annually on March 10 and September 10 of each year, beginning March 10, 2014. Interest on the 2024 notes and the 2044 notes is due semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning February 15, 2014. The net proceeds of the September 2013 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of our $1.25 billion 5.25% senior notes that matured December 16, 2013 and repurchases of shares of our common stock. In April 2013, we issued $1.0 billion of 2.70% senior notes due April 1, 2023 at a discount of $2 million and $1.0 billion of 4.20% senior notes due April 1, 2043 at a discount of $4 million (together, the \"April 2013 issuance\"). Interest on these notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2013. The net proceeds of the April 2013 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock. In November 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on September 10, 2018 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on the 2018 notes for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 88 basis points. At February 1, 2015, the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $8 million , which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Also in November 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on September 15, 2020 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on our 3.95% senior notes due September 15, 2020 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 183 basis points. At February 1, 2015, the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $25 million , which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. At February 1, 2015, we had an outstanding interest rate swap that expires on March 1, 2016 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on our 5.40% senior notes due March 1, 2016 for 24 variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 300 basis points. At February 1, 2015, the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $19 million , which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . In connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . In December 2014, we replaced our back-up credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in July 2017, with a new, substantially identical $2.0 billion credit facility. The new credit facility expires in December 2019 and contains various restrictive covenants. At February 1, 2015 , we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. At February 1, 2015, there were $290 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs and no borrowings outstanding under the related credit facility. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our commercial paper programs and related credit facility. We use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers and store support centers. The net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-Term Debt and Current Installments of Long-Term Debt. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with the sale of HD Supply, Inc. on August 30, 2007, we guaranteed a $1.0 billion senior secured amortizing term loan of HD Supply, Inc. The original expiration date of the guarantee was August 30, 2012. In March 2010, we amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to April 1, 2014. The fair value of the guarantee at August 30, 2007 was $16 million and was recorded as a liability in Other Long-Term Liabilities. The extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to $67 million, resulting in a $51 million charge to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2010. In April 2012, the term loan guarantee was terminated. As a result, we reversed the $67 million liability related to the guarantee, resulting in a $67 million pretax benefit to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2012. As of February 1, 2015 , we had $1.7 billion in Cash and Cash Equivalents. We believe that our current cash position, access to the long-term debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases, obligations incurred as a result of the Data Breach and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. In March 2015, we entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $850 million of our common stock. Under the agreement, we paid $850 million to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of approximately 7 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement will be determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the ASR agreement. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 25 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of February 1, 2015 (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual Obligations Total   2016-2017  2018-2019  Thereafter Total Debt (1) $ 16,543  $  $ 3,001  $ 2,150  $ 11,100 Interest Payments on Debt (2) 11,603   1,231  1,127  8,528 Capital Lease Obligations (3) 1,410     Operating Leases 7,705   1,554  1,199  4,059 Purchase Obligations (4) 1,203  1,020     Unrecognized Tax Benefits (5)        Total $ 38,734  $ 3,305  $ 6,121  $ 4,741  $ 24,567 ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1) Excludes present value of capital lease obligations, fair value of interest rate swaps and unamortized debt discounts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Interest payments are at current interest rates including the impact of active interest rate swaps. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Includes $ 726 million of imputed interest. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, software acquisitions and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) Excludes $495 million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. ##TABLE_END Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. Interest rate swap agreements are used, at times, to manage our fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. At February 1, 2015 , after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, approximately 90% of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate debt and 10% was floating-rate debt. A 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. As of February 1, 2015 we had, net of discounts, $ 16.2 billion of senior notes outstanding. The aggregate market value of these publicly traded senior notes as of February 1, 2015 was approximately $ 19.0 billion . We are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. Revenues from these foreign operations accounted for approximately $8.5 billion of our revenue in both fiscal 2014 and 2013. Our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition or results of operations. Impact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices We have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates. Revenues We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. We have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. However, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely 26 impacted. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. We also record Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. Merchandise Inventories Our Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, with approximately 74% valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method. Retailers like us, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, Merchandise Inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. We evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the end of fiscal 2014 or 2013 . Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, \"swell\") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. We estimate shrink as a percent of Net Sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. The estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2014 , 2013 or 2012 . Self-Insurance We have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability (including product liability), workers compensation, employee group medical and automobile claims for which we are self-insured. Our self-insured retention or deductible, as applicable, for each claim involving general liability, workers' compensation and automobile liability is limited to $25 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively. We do not have any stop loss limits for self-insured employee group medical claims. Our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. The liabilities are reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2014 , 2013 or 2012 . We maintain network security and privacy liability insurance coverage to limit our exposure to losses such as those that may be caused by a significant compromise or breach of our data security. This coverage is discussed further in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. We believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors. Volume rebates and certain advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in SGA. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, managements decision to relocate or close a store or other location 27 before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, we also recognize in SGA the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of long-lived assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition and inflation. A 10% decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations. Our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations. A 10% decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10% increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations. We recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, as well as for the China store closings in fiscal 2012, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2014 , 2013 or 2012 . Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. Each year we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments, with a quantitative assessment completed at least once every three years. Our most recent quantitative assessment was completed in fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2014, we completed our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for our U.S., Canada and Mexico reporting units. We performed qualitative assessments, concluding that the fair value of our reporting units was not more likely than not less than the carrying value. In fiscal 2012, we recorded a charge of $97 million to impair all of the goodwill associated with our former China reporting unit. There were no impairment charges related to our remaining goodwill for fiscal 2014 , 2013 or 2012 . We amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to ten years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. There were no impairment charges related to our other intangible assets for fiscal 2014 , 2013 or 2012 . Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\" (\"ASU No. 2014-09\"), which requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early application is not permitted. The guidance permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. ", "7A": " Item 7A.

Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2015 based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of February 1, 2015 in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2015 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included on page 30 in this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START /s/ C RAIG A.

Tom Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President  Corporate Services ##TABLE_END29 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders The Home Depot, Inc.: We have audited The Home Depot, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Home Depot, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, The Home Depot, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 1, 2015 , and our report dated March 26, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/ KPMG LLP Atlanta, Georgia March 26, 2015  30 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders The Home Depot, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 1, 2015 . These Consolidated Financial Statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Consolidated Financial Statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business, Consolidation and Presentation The Home Depot, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") operate The Home Depot stores, which are full-service, warehouse-style stores averaging approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. The stores stock approximately 30,000 to 40,000 different kinds of building materials, home improvement supplies and lawn and garden products that are sold to do-it-yourself customers, do-it-for-me customers and professional customers. The Company also offers a significantly broader product assortment through its Home Depot, Home Decorators Collection and Blinds.com websites. At the end of fiscal 2014 , the Company was operating 2,269 The Home Depot stores, which included 1,977 stores in the United States, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam (\"U.S.\"), 181 stores in Canada and 111 stores in Mexico. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year is a 52 - or 53 -week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31 . Fiscal years ended February 1, 2015 (\"fiscal 2014 \") and February 2, 2014 (\"fiscal 2013 \") include 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended February 3, 2013 (\"fiscal 2012 \") includes 53 weeks. Use of Estimates Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses in preparing these financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Receivables, Short-Term Debt and Accounts Payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments. The fair value of the Companys Long-Term Debt is discussed in Note 11. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Companys cash equivalents are carried at fair market value and consist primarily of money market funds. Accounts Receivable The Company has an agreement with a third-party service provider who directly extends credit to customers, manages the Companys private label credit card program and owns the related receivables. The Company evaluated the third-party entities holding the receivables under the program and concluded that they should not be consolidated by the Company. The agreement with the third-party service provider expires in 2018 , with the Company having the option, but no obligation, to purchase the receivables at the end of the agreement. The deferred interest charges incurred by the Company for its deferred financing programs offered to its customers are included in Cost of Sales. The interchange fees charged to the Company for the customers use of the cards and any profit sharing with the third-party service provider are included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses (\"SGA\"). The sum of the three is referred to by the Company as \"the cost of credit\" of the private label credit card program. In addition, certain subsidiaries of the Company extend credit directly to customers in the ordinary course of business. The receivables due from customers were $ 68 million and $ 57 million as of February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 , respectively. The Companys valuation reserve related to accounts receivable was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of the end of fiscal 2014 or 2013 . Merchandise Inventories The majority of the Companys Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, as determined by the retail inventory method. As the inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, the inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Certain subsidiaries, including retail 37 operations in Canada and Mexico, and distribution centers, record Merchandise Inventories at the lower of cost or market, as determined by a cost method. These Merchandise Inventories represent approximately 26% of the total Merchandise Inventories balance. The Company evaluates the inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of the end of fiscal 2014 or 2013 . Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in stores, the Company accrues for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, \"swell\") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. The Company provides for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as for those deferred due to timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Non-U.S. subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, are not eligible to be included in the Companys consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Separate provisions for income taxes have been determined for these entities. The Company intends to reinvest substantially all of the unremitted earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries and postpone their remittance indefinitely. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes on these earnings was recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Depreciation and Amortization The Companys Buildings, Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold Improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the original term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. The Companys Property and Equipment is depreciated using the following estimated useful lives:  ##TABLE_START  Life Buildings 5  45 years Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment 2  20 years Leasehold Improvements 5  45 years ##TABLE_ENDCapitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to six years. Certain development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred. Revenues The Company recognizes revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. The liability for sales returns is estimated based on historical return levels. When the Company receives payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. The Company also records Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognizes 38 this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. Gift card breakage income is recognized based upon historical redemption patterns and represents the balance of gift cards for which the Company believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote. During fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , the Company recognized $ 32 million , $ 30 million and $ 33 million , respectively, of gift card breakage income. This income is included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a reduction in SGA. Services Revenue Net Sales include services revenue generated through a variety of installation, home maintenance and professional service programs. In these programs, the customer selects and purchases material for a project, and the Company provides or arranges professional installation. These programs are offered through the Companys stores and in-home sales programs. Under certain programs, when the Company provides or arranges the installation of a project and the subcontractor provides material as part of the installation, both the material and labor are included in services revenue. The Company recognizes this revenue when the service for the customer is complete. All payments received prior to the completion of services are recorded in Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Services revenue was $ 3.8 billion , $ 3.5 billion and $ 3.2 billion for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Self-Insurance The Company is self-insured for certain losses related to general liability (including product liability), workers compensation, employee group medical and automobile claims. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date is not discounted and is recognized as a liability. The expected ultimate cost of claims is estimated based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. The Company maintains network security and privacy liability insurance coverage to limit the Company's exposure to losses such as those that may be caused by a significant compromise or breach of the Company's data security. This coverage is discussed further in Note 13. Prepaid Advertising Television and radio advertising production costs, along with media placement costs, are expensed when the advertisement first appears. Amounts included in Other Current Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to prepayments of production costs for print and broadcast advertising as well as sponsorship promotions were not material at the end of fiscal 2014 and 2013 . Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and certain advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense. In fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , gross advertising expense was $ 884 million , $ 865 million and $ 831 million , respectively, and is included in SGA. Specific, incremental and identifiable advertising co-op allowances were $ 125 million , $ 114 million and $ 85 million for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, and are recorded as an offset to advertising expense in SGA. Cost of Sales Cost of Sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed, the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to the Companys stores, locations or customers, the operating cost of the Companys sourcing and distribution network and the cost of deferred interest programs offered through the Companys private label credit card program. The cost of handling and shipping merchandise from the Companys stores, locations or distribution centers to the customer is classified as SGA. The cost of shipping and handling, including internal costs and payments to third parties, classified as SGA was $ 443 million , $ 410 million and $ 394 million in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. 39 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates its long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, managements decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, the Company also recognizes in SGA the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. The Company recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, as well as for the closing of seven stores in China in fiscal 2012, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2014 , 2013 or 2012 . Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. The Company does not amortize goodwill but does assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. Each year the Company may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments, with a quantitative assessment completed at least once every three years. The Company's most recent quantitative assessment was completed in fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2014, the Company completed its annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for its U.S., Canada and Mexico reporting units. The Company performed qualitative assessments, concluding that the fair value of the reporting units was not more likely than not less than the carrying value. In fiscal 2012, the Company recorded a charge of $97 million to impair all of the goodwill associated with its former China reporting unit. There were no impairment charges related to the remaining goodwill for fiscal 2014 , 2013 or 2012 . The Company amortizes the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to ten years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. There were no impairment charges related to other intangible assets for fiscal 2014 , 2013 or 2012 . Stock-Based Compensation The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $ 14.13 , $ 13.10 and $ 9.86 , respectively. The fair value of these options was determined at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  February 1, 2015  February 2, 2014  February 3, 2013 Risk-free interest rate 1.7 %  0.8 %  1.2 % Assumed volatility 22.7 %  26.3 %  27.0 % Assumed dividend yield 2.3 %  2.2 %  2.3 % Assumed lives of options 5 years  5 years  5 years ##TABLE_ENDDerivatives The Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate exposure on long-term debt and its exposure on foreign currency fluctuations. The Company accounts for its derivative financial instruments in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (\"FASB ASC\") Subtopic 815-10. The fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments is discussed in Note 11. 40 Comprehensive Income Comprehensive Income includes Net Earnings adjusted for certain gains and losses that are excluded from Net Earnings under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Adjustments to Net Earnings and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income consist primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses are generally translated using average exchange rates for the period and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the day of the transaction. Segment Information The Company operates within a single reportable segment primarily within North America.

At the end of fiscal 2013, the Company owned 16.3 million shares of HD Supply Holdings, Inc. (\"HD Supply\") common stock, which represented approximately 8% of the shares of HD Supply common stock outstanding. This investment is accounted for using the cost method, as there are significant restrictions in place on the Company's ability to sell or transfer its HD Supply shares. The restrictions are controlled by the three largest shareholders of HD Supply (the \"Principal Shareholders\") for so long as they continue to own a certain portion of their original holdings of HD Supply. The carrying value of the HD Supply shares was impaired by the Company to a zero cost basis in fiscal 2009. In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, the Principal Shareholders elected to sell shares of HD Supply common stock in a secondary public offering (the \"May Offering\"). Under the terms of a registration rights agreement among the Company, HD Supply and the Principal Shareholders (the \"Registration Rights Agreement\"), the Company had the right to include a portion of its shares in the May Offering and elected to do so. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014, two of the Principal Shareholders again elected to sell shares of HD Supply common stock in secondary public offerings, and the Company again exercised its rights under the Registration Rights Agreement to include a portion of its shares in these offerings. As a result of all of these offerings (including an overallotment option exercised during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 by the underwriters of the May Offering), the Company sold 12.2 million shares of HD Supply common stock in fiscal 2014, for which it received $ 323 million of proceeds and recognized a corresponding gain in fiscal 2014. The total pretax gain of $ 323 million is included in Interest and Investment Income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2014. The remaining 4.1 million shares owned by the Company, which represent approximately 2% of the shares of HD Supply common stock outstanding, continue to be accounted for using the cost method as the restrictions on these shares remain in place. 3. PROPERTY AND LEASES Property and Equipment as of February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 consisted of the following (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  February 1, 2015  February 2, 2014 Property and Equipment, at cost:    Land $ 8,243  $ 8,375 Buildings 17,759  17,950 Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment 9,602  10,107 Leasehold Improvements 1,419  1,388 Construction in Progress  Capital Leases   38,513  39,064 Less Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization 15,793  15,716 Net Property and Equipment $ 22,720  $ 23,348 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company leases certain retail locations, office space, warehouse and distribution space, equipment and vehicles. While most of the leases are operating leases, certain locations and equipment are leased under capital leases. As leases expire, it can be expected that in the normal course of business certain leases will be renewed or replaced. Certain lease agreements include escalating rents over the lease terms. The Company expenses rent on a straight-line basis over the lease term, which commences on the date the Company has the right to control the property. The cumulative expense recognized on a straight-line basis in excess of the cumulative payments is included in Other Accrued Expenses and Other Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total rent expense, net of minor sublease income, for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $ 918 million , $ 905 million and $ 849 million , respectively. Certain store leases also provide for contingent rent payments based on percentages of sales in excess of specified minimums. Contingent rent expense for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was approximately $ 7 million , $ 5 million and $ 4 million , respectively. Real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and operating expenses applicable to the leased property are obligations of the Company under the lease agreements. 42 The approximate future minimum lease payments under capital and all other leases at February 1, 2015 were as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Capital Leases Operating Leases $ $ 2016 817 108 2018 638 97 Thereafter through 2097 4,059 1,410 $ 7,705 Less imputed interest Net present value of capital lease obligations Less current installments Long-term capital lease obligations, excluding current installments $ ##TABLE_ENDShort-term and long-term obligations for capital leases are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in Current Installments of Long-Term Debt and Long-Term Debt, respectively. The assets under capital leases recorded in Property and Equipment, net of amortization, totaled $ 557 million and $ 374 million at February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 , respectively. 4. DEBT The Company has commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . In connection with the programs, the Company has a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . In December 2014, the Company replaced its back-up credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in July 2017 , with a new, substantially identical $2.0 billion credit facility. The new credit facility expires in December 2019 and contains various restrictive covenants. At February 1, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact the Companys liquidity or capital resources. At February 1, 2015, there were $290 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs and no borrowings outstanding under the related credit facility. All of the Company's short-term borrowings in fiscal 2014 were under these commercial paper programs. For the fiscal year ended February 1, 2015, the maximum amount outstanding at any month-end was $290 million , the average daily short-term borrowings were $20 million and the weighted average interest rate was 0.13% . There were no borrowings under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility in fiscal 2013. 43 The Companys Long-Term Debt at the end of fiscal 2014 and 2013 consisted of the following (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  February 1, 2015  February 2, 2014 5.40% Senior Notes; due March 1, 2016; interest payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 $ 3,026  $ 3,042 2.25% Senior Notes; due September 10, 2018; interest payable semi-annually on March 10 and September 10 1,157  1,148 2.00% Senior Notes; due June 15, 2019; interest payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15   3.95% Senior Notes; due September 15, 2020; interest payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15  4.40% Senior Notes; due April 1, 2021; interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1  2.70% Senior Notes; due April 1, 2023; interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1  3.75% Senior Notes; due February 15, 2024; interest payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 1,095  1,094 5.875% Senior Notes; due December 16, 2036; interest payable semi-annually on June 16 and December 16 2,963  2,962 5.40% Senior Notes; due September 15, 2040; interest payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15  5.95% Senior Notes; due April 1, 2041; interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1  4.20% Senior Notes; due April 1, 2043; interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1  4.875% Senior Notes; due February 15, 2044; interest payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15  4.40% Senior Notes; due March 15, 2045; interest payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15   Capital Lease Obligations; payable in varying installments through January 31, 2055  Other  Total debt 16,907  14,724 Less current installments  Long-Term Debt, excluding current installments $ 16,869  $ 14,691 ##TABLE_ENDIn June 2014, the Company issued $1.0 billion of 2.00% senior notes due June 15, 2019 (the \"2019 notes\") at a discount of $4 million and $1.0 billion of 4.40% senior notes due March 15, 2045 (the \"2045 notes\") at a discount of $15 million (together, the \"June 2014 issuance\"). Interest on the 2019 notes is due semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2014. Interest on the 2045 notes is due semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2014. The net proceeds of the June 2014 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of the Company's common stock. The $19 million discount associated with the June 2014 issuance is being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method. Issuance costs associated with the June 2014 issuance were approximately $14 million and are being amortized over the term of the notes. In September 2013, the Company issued $1.15 billion of 2.25% senior notes due September 10, 2018 (the \"2018 notes\") at a discount of $1 million , $1.1 billion of 3.75% senior notes due February 15, 2024 (the \"2024 notes\") at a discount of $6 million and $1.0 billion of 4.875% senior notes due February 15, 2044 (the \"2044 notes\") at a discount of $15 million (together, the \"September 2013 issuance\"). Interest on the 2018 notes is due semi-annually on March 10 and September 10 of each year, beginning March 10, 2014. Interest on the 2024 notes and the 2044 notes is due semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning February 15, 2014. The net proceeds of the September 2013 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of the Company's $1.25 billion  5.25% senior notes that matured December 16, 2013 and repurchases of shares of the Company's common stock. The $22 million discount associated with the September 2013 issuance is being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method. Issuance costs 44 associated with the September 2013 issuance were approximately $19 million and are being amortized over the term of the notes. In April 2013, the Company issued $1.0 billion of 2.70% senior notes due April 1, 2023 at a discount of $2 million and $1.0 billion of 4.20% senior notes due April 1, 2043 at a discount of $4 million (together, the \"April 2013 issuance\"). Interest on these notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2013. The net proceeds of the April 2013 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of the Company's common stock. The $6 million discount associated with the April 2013 issuance is being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method. Issuance costs associated with the April 2013 issuance were approximately $15 million and are being amortized over the term of the notes. The Company's senior notes may be redeemed by the Company at any time, in whole or in part, at the redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the Par Call Date, as defined in the respective notes. Additionally, if a Change in Control Triggering Event occurs, as defined in each of the outstanding notes except for the 5.40% senior notes due March 1, 2016 (the \"2016 notes\"), holders of all notes other than the 2016 notes have the right to require the Company to redeem those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The Company is generally not limited under the indentures governing the notes in its ability to incur additional indebtedness or required to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. Further, while the indentures governing the notes contain various restrictive covenants, none are expected to impact the Companys liquidity or capital resources. In November 2013, the Company entered into an interest rate swap that expires on September 10, 2018 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on the 2018 notes for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 88 basis points.

At February 1, 2015, the Company had outstanding cross currency swap agreements with a notional amount of $676 million , accounted for as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency fluctuations on certain intercompany debt. At February 1, 2015, the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of $72 million , which is the estimated amount the Company would have received to settle the agreements. Interest Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings is net of interest capitalized of $2 million , $2 million and $3 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

At February 1, 2015 , the Company had state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, expiring at various dates beginning in 2015 to 2034 . Management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits related to the state net operating losses will be realized. However, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to utilize certain foreign net operating losses. Therefore, a valuation allowance has been provided to reduce the deferred tax asset related to foreign net operating losses to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Total valuation allowances related to foreign net operating losses at February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 were $6 million and $26 million , respectively. The Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on approximately $3.4 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries because of its intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable; however, unrecognized foreign income tax credits would be available to reduce a portion of this liability. The Companys income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. The Company is currently appealing certain proposed Internal Revenue Service examination adjustments for fiscal years 2005 through 2007 . The Company's U.S. federal tax returns for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 are currently under examination by the IRS. There are also ongoing U.S. state and local and other foreign audits covering fiscal years 2005 through 2013 . The Company does not expect the results from any income tax audit to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Over the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the resolution of federal and state tax examinations could reduce the Company's unrecognized tax benefits by $270 million . Final settlement of these audit issues may result in payments that are more or less than this amount, but the Company does not anticipate the resolution of these matters will result in a material change to its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Reconciliations of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  February 1, 2015  February 2, 2014  February 3, 2013 Unrecognized tax benefits balance at beginning of fiscal year $  $  $ Additions based on tax positions related to the current year   Additions for tax positions of prior years   Reductions for tax positions of prior years (212 )  (41 )  (15 ) Reductions due to settlements (7 )  (12 )  (94 ) Reductions due to lapse of statute of limitations (19 )  (7 )  (3 ) Unrecognized tax benefits balance at end of fiscal year $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the annual effective income tax rate on Net Earnings was $318 million , $344 million and $314 million as of February 1, 2015 , February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 , respectively. Net adjustments to accruals for interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions resulted in expenses of $2 million , $7 million and $15 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Total accrued interest and penalties as of February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 were $104 million and $101 million , respectively. Interest and penalties are included in Interest Expense and SGA, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 48 7. EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS The Home Depot, Inc. Amended and Restated 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (\"2005 Plan\") and The Home Depot, Inc. 1997 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (\"1997 Plan\" and collectively with the 2005 Plan, the \"Plans\") provide that incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares, performance units and deferred shares may be issued to selected associates, officers and directors of the Company. Under the 2005 Plan, the maximum number of shares of the Companys common stock authorized for issuance is 255 million shares, with any award other than a stock option or stock appreciation right reducing the number of shares available for issuance by 2.11 shares. As of February 1, 2015 , there were 141 million shares available for future grants under the 2005 Plan. No additional equity awards could be issued from the 1997 Plan after the adoption of the 2005 Plan on May 26, 2005. Under the terms of the Plans, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options must have an exercise price at or above the fair market value of the Companys stock on the date of the grant. Typically, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options vest at the rate of 25% per year commencing on the first or second anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth anniversary date of the grant. Additionally, certain stock options may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The Company recognized $ 23 million , $ 24 million and $ 23 million of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, related to stock options. Restrictions on the restricted stock issued under the Plans generally lapse according to one of the following schedules: (1) the restrictions on the restricted stock lapse over various periods up to five years, (2) the restrictions on 25% of the restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing upon the associates attainment of age 62, or (3) the restrictions on 25% of the restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing upon the earlier of the associates attainment of age 60 or the tenth anniversary of the grant date. The Company has also granted performance shares under the Plans, the payout of which is dependent on the Companys performance against target average return on invested capital and operating profit over a three-year performance cycle. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The fair value of the restricted stock and performance shares is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and performance shares of $ 168 million , $ 171 million and $ 166 million in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. In fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , there were an aggregate of 206 thousand , 223 thousand and 313 thousand deferred shares, respectively, granted under the Plans. For associates, each deferred share entitles the individual to one share of common stock to be received up to five years after the grant date of the deferred shares, subject to certain deferral rights of the associate. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to deferred shares of $ 14 million , $ 14 million and $ 13 million in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The Company maintains two Employee Stock Purchase Plans (\"ESPPs\") (U.S. and non-U.S. plans). The plan for U.S. associates is a tax-qualified plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The non-U.S. plan is not a Section 423 plan. As of February 1, 2015 , there were 24 million shares available under the plan for U.S associates and 19 million shares available under the non-U.S. plan. The purchase price of shares under the ESPPs is equal to 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day of the purchase period, which is a six-month period ending on December 31 and June 30 of each year. During fiscal 2014 , there were 1 million shares purchased under the ESPPs at an average price of $ 77.15 . Under the outstanding ESPPs as of February 1, 2015 , employees have contributed $ 15 million to purchase shares at 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day ( June 30, 2015 ) of the current purchase period. The Company recognized $ 20 million , $ 19 million and $ 16 million of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, related to the ESPPs. In total, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense, including the expense of stock options, restricted stock, performance shares, deferred shares and ESPP shares, of $ 225 million , $ 228 million and $ 218 million , in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. 49 The following table summarizes stock options outstanding at February 1, 2015 , February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 , and changes during the fiscal years ended on these dates (shares in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Number of Shares  Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at January 29, 2012 33,170  $ 35.32 Granted 2,376  49.89 Exercised (18,119 )  38.24 Canceled (810 )  35.27 Outstanding at February 3, 2013 16,617  $ 34.23 Granted 1,704  69.91 Exercised (4,240 )  31.71 Canceled (122 )  43.80 Outstanding at February 2, 2014 13,959  $ 39.26 Granted 1,912  81.84 Exercised (4,387 )  32.41 Canceled (439 )  56.26 Outstanding at February 1, 2015 11,045  $ 48.68 ##TABLE_ENDThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $ 234 million , $ 181 million and $ 246 million in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. As of February 1, 2015 , there were approximately 11 million stock options outstanding with a weighted average remaining life of six years and an intrinsic value of $ 616 million . As of February 1, 2015 , there were approximately 4 million stock options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $ 31.99 , a weighted average remaining life of four years, and an intrinsic value of $ 292 million . As of February 1, 2015 , there were approximately 9 million stock options vested or expected to ultimately vest. As of February 1, 2015 , there was $ 39 million of unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years. The following table summarizes restricted stock and performance shares outstanding at February 1, 2015 , February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 , and changes during the fiscal years ended on these dates (shares in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Number of Shares  Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at January 29, 2012 15,741  $ 31.81 Granted 3,965  49.18 Restrictions lapsed (5,295 )  30.62 Canceled (1,172 )  35.29 Outstanding at February 3, 2013 13,239  $ 37.18 Granted 3,092  68.44 Restrictions lapsed (5,048 )  30.67 Canceled (827 )  46.53 Outstanding at February 2, 2014 10,456  $ 48.82 Granted 2,963  76.71 Restrictions lapsed (4,119 )  39.90 Canceled (804 )  59.55 Outstanding at February 1, 2015 8,496  $ 61.86 ##TABLE_ENDAs of February 1, 2015 , there was $ 297 million of unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and performance shares, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years. The total fair value of restricted stock and performance shares vesting during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $ 334 million , $ 353 million and $ 265 million , respectively. 50 8. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company maintains active defined contribution retirement plans for its employees (the \"Benefit Plans\"). All associates satisfying certain service requirements are eligible to participate in the Benefit Plans. The Company makes cash contributions each payroll period up to specified percentages of associates contributions as approved by the Board of Directors. The Company also maintains a restoration plan to provide certain associates deferred compensation that they would have received under the Benefit Plans as a matching contribution if not for the maximum compensation limits under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company funds the restoration plan through contributions made to a grantor trust, which are then used to purchase shares of the Companys common stock in the open market. The Companys contributions to the Benefit Plans and the restoration plan were $ 182 million , $ 184 million and $ 182 million for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. At February 1, 2015 , the Benefit Plans and the restoration plan held a total of 10 million shares of the Companys common stock in trust for plan participants.  9. CHINA STORE CLOSINGS In fiscal 2012, the Company closed its remaining seven big box stores in China. As a result of the closings, the Company recorded a total charge of $145 million , net of tax, in fiscal 2012. Inventory markdown costs of $10 million are included in Cost of Sales, and $135 million of costs related to the impairment of goodwill and other assets, lease terminations, severance and other charges are included in SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 10. DEBT GUARANTEE In connection with the sale of HD Supply, Inc. on August 30, 2007 , the Company guaranteed a $1.0 billion senior secured amortizing term loan of HD Supply, Inc. The original expiration date of the guarantee was August 30, 2012. In March 2010, the Company amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to April 1, 2014. The fair value of the guarantee at August 30, 2007 was $16 million and was recorded as a liability of the Company in Other Long-Term Liabilities. The extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to $67 million , resulting in a $51 million charge to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2010. In April 2012 , the term loan guarantee was terminated. As a result, the Company reversed its $67 million liability related to the guarantee, resulting in a $67 million pretax benefit to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2012. 11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties. A liabilitys fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, rather than the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers are: ##TABLE_START  Level 1  Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets  Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  Level 3  Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions ##TABLE_END51 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The assets and liabilities of the Company that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 were as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fair Value at February 1, 2015 Using  Fair Value at February 2, 2014 Using  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Derivative agreements - assets $   $  $   $   $  $  Derivative agreements - liabilities         (10 )   Total $   $  $   $   $  $  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate exposure on long-term debt and its exposure on foreign currency fluctuations. The fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments was measured using level 2 inputs. The Companys derivative agreements are discussed further in Note 4. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets were analyzed for impairment on a nonrecurring basis using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3). Impairment charges related to long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal 2014 and 2013 were not material, as further discussed in Note 1 under the captions \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\" and \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" respectively. The aggregate fair value of the Companys senior notes, based on quoted market prices, was $ 19.0 billion and $ 15.6 billion at February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 , respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 16.2 billion and $ 14.2 billion at February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 , respectively. 12. BASIC AND DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES The reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average common shares for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  February 1, 2015  February 2, 2014  February 3, 2013 Weighted average common shares 1,338  1,425  1,499 Effect of potentially dilutive securities:      Stock plans   Diluted weighted average common shares 1,346  1,434  1,511 ##TABLE_ENDStock plans consist of shares granted under the Companys employee stock plans as described in Note 7. Options to purchase 1 million , 1 million and 1 million shares of common stock at February 1, 2015 , February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 , respectively, were excluded from the computation of Diluted Earnings per Share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES At February 1, 2015 , the Company was contingently liable for approximately $392 million under outstanding letters of credit and open accounts issued for certain business transactions, including insurance programs, trade contracts and construction contracts. The Companys letters of credit are primarily performance-based and are not based on changes in variable components, a liability or an equity security of the other party. In addition to the Data Breach described below, the Company is involved in litigation arising from the normal course of business. In management's opinion, this litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Data Breach In the third quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company confirmed that its payment data systems were breached, which potentially impacted customers who used payment cards at self-checkout systems in the Company's U.S. and Canadian stores (the \"Data Breach\"). The Company's investigation to date has determined the intruder used a vendors user name and password to enter 52 the perimeter of the Companys network. The intruder then acquired elevated rights that allowed it to navigate portions of the Companys systems and to deploy unique, custom-built malware on the Companys self-checkout systems to access payment card information of customers who shopped at the Company's U.S. and Canadian stores between April 2014 and September 2014. The investigation of the Data Breach is ongoing, and the Company is supporting law enforcement efforts to identify the responsible parties. Expenses Incurred and Amounts Accrued In fiscal 2014, the Company recorded $63 million of pretax expenses related to the Data Breach, partially offset by $30 million of expected insurance proceeds for costs the Company believes are reimbursable and probable of recovery under its insurance coverage, for pretax net expenses of $33 million . These expenses are included in SGA expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2014. Expenses include costs to investigate the Data Breach; provide identity protection services, including credit monitoring, to impacted customers; increase call center staffing; and pay legal and other professional services, all of which were expensed as incurred. At February 1, 2015, accrued liabilities and insurance receivable related to the Data Breach consisted of the following (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Accrued Liabilities  Insurance Receivable (Expenses incurred) insurance receivable recorded $ (63 )  $ Payments made (received)  (10 ) Balance at February 1, 2015 $ (12 )  $ ##TABLE_ENDLitigation, Claims and Government Investigations In addition to the above expenses, the Company believes it is probable that the payment card networks will make claims against the Company. The ultimate amount of these claims will likely include amounts for incremental counterfeit fraud losses and non-ordinary course operating expenses (such as card reissuance costs) that the payment card networks assert they or their issuing banks have incurred. In order for the Company to have liability for such claims, the Company believes it would have to be determined, among other things, that (1) at the time of the Data Breach the portion of the Companys network that handles payment card data was noncompliant with applicable data security standards, and (2) the alleged noncompliance caused at least some portion of the compromise of payment card data that occurred during the Data Breach. Although an independent third-party assessor found the portion of the Companys network that handles payment card data to be compliant with applicable data security standards in the fall of 2013, and the process of obtaining such certification for 2014 was ongoing at the time of the Data Breach, in March 2015 the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card networks alleged that the Company was not in compliance with certain of those standards at the time of the Data Breach. As a result, the Company believes it is probable that the payment card networks will make claims against it and that the Company will dispute those claims. When those claims are asserted, the Company will have to determine, based on the facts and information then available to it, whether to litigate or seek to settle those claims. At this time, the Company believes that settlement negotiations will ensue and that it is probable that the Company will incur a loss in connection with those claims. The Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of losses because no claims have yet been asserted and because there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. The Company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The Company believes that the ultimate amount paid on payment card network claims could be material to the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in future periods. In addition, at least 57 actions have been filed in courts in the U.S. and Canada, and other claims may be asserted against the Company on behalf of customers, payment card brands, payment card issuing banks, shareholders or others seeking damages or other related relief, allegedly arising from the Data Breach. Furthermore, several state and federal agencies, including State Attorneys General, are investigating events related to the Data Breach, including how it occurred, its consequences and the Company's responses. The Company is cooperating in the governmental investigations, and the Company may be subject to fines or other obligations. While a loss from these matters is reasonably possible, the Company is not able to estimate the costs, or range of costs, related to these matters because the proceedings remain in the early stages, alleged damages have not been specified, there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. The Company has not concluded that a loss from these matters is probable; therefore, the Company has not recorded an accrual for litigation, claims and governmental investigations related to these matters in fiscal 2014. The Company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes 53 known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The Company believes that the ultimate amount paid on these actions, claims and investigations could be material to the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in future periods. Future Costs The Company expects to incur significant legal and other professional services expenses associated with the Data Breach in future periods. The Company will recognize these expenses as services are received. Costs related to the Data Breach that may be incurred in future periods may also include liabilities to payment card networks for reimbursements of credit card fraud and card reissuance costs; liabilities related to the Companys private label credit card fraud and card reissuance costs; liabilities from current and future civil litigation, governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings; future expenses for legal, investigative and consulting fees; and incremental expenses and capital investments for remediation activities. The Company believes that the ultimate amount paid on these services and claims could be material to the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in future periods. Insurance Coverage The Company maintained $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage in fiscal 2014, above a $7.5 million deductible, to limit the Company's exposure to losses such as those related to the Data Breach. As of February 1, 2015 , the Company had received an initial payment of $10 million of insurance reimbursements, and expects to receive additional payments. In fiscal 2015, the Company entered into a new policy, with $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage, above a $10 million deductible, to limit the Company's exposure to similar losses. 14.

In fiscal 2015 , we announced an evolution of this strategy to reflect the changing needs of our customers and our business. The fundamental aspects remain the same, but we are now focused more than ever on connecting various aspects of our business to drive value for our customers, our associates, our suppliers and our shareholders. Our current strategic framework is comprised of three key initiatives  Customer Experience, Product Authority, and Productivity and Efficiency Driven by Capital Allocation  tied together by our interconnecting retail initiative. As customers increasingly expect to be able to buy how, when and where they want, we believe that providing a seamless and frictionless shopping experience across multiple channels, featuring innovative and expanded product choices delivered in a fast and cost-efficient manner, will be a key enabler for future success. Becoming a best-in-class interconnected retailer is growing in importance as the line between online and in-store shopping continues to blur and customers demand increased value and convenience. Interconnecting retail is woven through each of our other three initiatives, as discussed in more detail below. For example, under our customer experience initiative, we are focused on connecting our stores to our online experience and connecting service to customer needs. Under our product authority initiative, we are focused on connecting our product assortment to local needs and connecting our customers with product information to inspire and empower them. Under our productivity and efficiency initiative, we are focused on connecting our merchandise from our suppliers to our customers by optimizing our supply chain. Overall, we are collaborating more closely, both internally and externally, through deeper cross-functional work and a more integrated, longer-term approach with our suppliers and other business partners, to build complete end-to-end solutions. Customer Experience Our customer experience initiative is anchored on the principles of putting customers first and taking care of our associates. Our commitment to customer service is a key part of this initiative, and in fiscal 2015 , to underscore the importance of customer service, we re-trained our store associates on our Customer FIRST program. We recognize that the customer experience includes more than just customer service, and we have taken a number of steps to enhance this initiative to provide our customers with a seamless and frictionless shopping experience in our stores, online, on the job site or in their homes. Our Customers . We serve three primary customer groups, and we have different approaches to meet their particular needs: ##TABLE_START  Do-It-Yourself (\"DIY\") Customers. These customers are typically home owners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. Our associates assist these customers with specific product and installation questions both in our stores and through online resources and other media designed to provide product and project knowledge. We also offer a variety of clinics and workshops both to impart this knowledge and to build an emotional connection with our DIY customers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Do-It-For-Me (\"DIFM\") Customers. These customers are typically home owners who purchase materials and hire third parties to complete the project or installation. Our stores offer a variety of installation services targeted at DIFM customers who purchase products and installation of those products from us in our stores, online or in their homes through in-home consultations. Our installation programs include many categories, such as flooring, cabinets, countertops, water heaters and sheds. In addition, we provide third-party professional installation in a number of categories sold through our in-home sales programs, such as roofing, siding, windows, cabinet refacing, furnaces and central air systems. This customer group is growing due to changing demographics, which we believe will increase demand for our installation services. Further, our focus on serving the professional customers, or \"Pros\", who perform these services for our DIFM customers will help us drive higher product sales. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Professional Customers . These customers are primarily professional renovators/remodelers, general contractors, repairmen, installers, small business owners and tradesmen. With our acquisition of Interline Brands, Inc. (\"Interline\") in August 2015, we expanded our service to the maintenance, repair and operations (\"MRO\") Pro. We recognize the unique service needs of the Pro customer and use our expertise to facilitate their buying experience. We offer a variety of special programs to these customers, including delivery and will-call services, dedicated staff, expanded credit programs, designated parking spaces close to store entrances and bulk pricing programs for both online and in-store purchases. In addition, we maintain a loyalty program, Pro Xtra, that provides our Pros with discounts on useful business services, exclusive product offers and a purchase tracking tool to enable receipt lookup ##TABLE_END 2 online and job tracking of purchases across all forms of payment. This program, introduced in fiscal 2013, has continued to gain traction, with almost 4 million customers enrolled by the end of fiscal 2015 . We also recognize that our Pros have differing needs depending on the type of work they perform. Our goal is to develop a wide spectrum of solutions for all of our professional customers, such as supplying both recurring MRO needs and core building materials to large-scale property managers and providing inventory management solutions for our traditional Pro customers. We believe developing a unified approach to service all the needs of our Pros will differentiate us from competitors who are solely traditional retail, installation or MRO companies. We help our DIY, DIFM and Pro customers finance their projects by offering private label credit products in our stores through third-party credit providers. We also help certain of our Pros through our own programs. In fiscal 2015 , our customers opened approximately 3.2 million new The Home Depot private label credit accounts, and at fiscal year end the total number of The Home Depot active account holders was approximately 12 million. Private label credit card sales accounted for approximately 23% of sales in fiscal 2015 . In addition, in the U.S. we re-launched our private label credit program at the end of fiscal 2015 with additional benefits, including a 365-day return policy for all of our customers and commercial fuel rewards and extended payment terms for our Pros. Our Associates. Our associates are key to our customer experience initiative. As noted above, we empower our associates to deliver excellent customer service through our Customer FIRST training program, and we strive to remove complexity and inefficient processes from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers. In fiscal 2015 , we began to roll out a number of new initiatives to improve freight handling in the stores, as well as Project Sync, which is discussed in more detail below under \"Logistics\". All of these programs are designed to make our freight handling process more efficient, which allows our associates to devote more time to the customer experience and makes working at The Home Depot a better experience for them. We also have a number of programs to recognize stores and individual associates for exceptional customer and community service. At the end of fiscal 2015 , we employed approximately 385,000 associates, of whom approximately 24,000 were salaried, with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis. To attract and retain qualified personnel, we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve. We measure associate satisfaction regularly, and we believe that our employee relations are very good. Interconnecting Retail . In fiscal 2015 , we continued to enhance our customers interconnected shopping experiences through a variety of initiatives. Our associates used second generation FIRST phones, our web-enabled handheld devices, to help customers complete online sales in the aisle, expedite the checkout process for customers during peak traffic periods, locate products in the aisles and online, and check inventory on hand. We have also empowered our customers with improved product location and inventory availability tools through enhancements to our website and mobile app, and we have invested heavily in content improvements such as videos, ratings and reviews, and more detailed product information. These enhancements are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers who research products online and then go into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate before making the purchase. While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews, compare prices, view our extended assortment and purchase products. We continued to make enhancements to our special order process in fiscal 2015 with our new Customer Order Management platform (\"COM\"), which was introduced in fiscal 2014. This platform is designed to provide greater visibility into and improved execution of special orders by our associates and a more seamless and frictionless experience for our customers. After COM is rolled out to all U.S. stores, which we expect to occur by the end of fiscal 2016, store associates, suppliers and customers will be able to access relevant special order information online, regardless of where the order was placed. In addition, we have three online contact centers to service our online customers needs. We also recognize that customers desire greater flexibility and convenience when it comes to receiving their products and services. In fiscal 2015 , we began to roll out Buy Online, Deliver From Store (\"BODFS\"), which complements our existing interconnecting retail programs: Buy Online, Pick-up In Store (\"BOPIS\"), Buy Online, Ship to Store (\"BOSS\") and Buy Online, Return In Store (\"BORIS\"). We expect to complete the roll out of BODFS by the end of fiscal 2016. We will continue to blend our physical and digital assets in a seamless and frictionless way to enhance the end-to-end customer experience. 3 Product Authority Our product authority initiative is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value. In fiscal 2015 , we continued to introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our DIY, DIFM and Pro customers, while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online. Our Products. In fiscal 2015 , we introduced a number of innovative and distinctive products to our customers at attractive values. Examples of these new products include EGO  58-volt cordless outdoor power tools (string trimmer, hedge trimmer, blower, chainsaw and lawn mower); the Husky  100 platform of mechanics tools; LifeProof Carpet  ; Milwaukee  Cobalt Red Helix  drill bits; and Feit  Electric HomeBrite  Bluetooth  Smart LED light bulbs. During fiscal 2015 , we continued to offer value to our customers through our proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments. Highlights of these offerings include Husky  hand tools and tool storage; Everbilt  hardware and fasteners; Hampton Bay  lighting, ceiling fans and patio furniture; Vigoro  lawn care products; RIDGID  and Ryobi  power tools; Glacier Bay  bath fixtures; HDX  storage and cleaning products; and Home Decorators Collection  furniture and home dcor. We will continue to assess departments and categories, both online and in-store, for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within The Home Depots portfolio of proprietary and exclusive brands. We maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality and innovative products directly from manufacturers around the world. In fiscal 2015 , in addition to our U.S. sourcing operations, we maintained sourcing offices in China, Taiwan, India, Italy, Mexico and Canada. With our acquisition of Interline, we also acquired additional sourcing offices in China, Thailand and Indonesia. The percentage of Net Sales of each of our major product categories (and related services) for each of the last three fiscal years is presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\". Net Sales outside the U.S. were $8.0 billion , $8.5 billion and $8.5 billion for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Long-lived assets outside the U.S. totaled $2.3 billion , $2.5 billion and $2.9 billion as of January 31, 2016 , February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 , respectively. Quality Assurance . Our suppliers are obligated to ensure that their products comply with applicable international, federal, state and local laws. In addition, we have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to establishing criteria and overseeing compliance with safety, quality and performance standards for our proprietary branded products. We also have a global Supplier Social and Environmental Responsibility Program designed to ensure that all suppliers adhere to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility. Environmentally-Friendly Products and Programs. The Home Depot is committed to sustainable business practices  from the environmental impact of our operations, to our sourcing activities, to our involvement within the communities in which we do business. We believe these efforts continue to be successful in creating value for our customers and shareholders. For example, we offer a growing selection of environmentally-preferred products, which supports sustainability and helps our customers save energy, water and money. Through our Eco Options  Program introduced in 2007, we have created product categories that allow customers to easily identify products that meet specifications for energy efficiency, water conservation, healthy home, clean air and sustainable forestry. As of the end of fiscal 2015 , our Eco Options  Program included over 10,000 products. Through this program, we sell ENERGY STAR  certified appliances, LED light bulbs, tankless water heaters and other products that enable our customers to save on their utility bills. We estimate that in fiscal 2015 we helped customers save over $700 million in electricity costs through sales of ENERGY STAR  certified products and over $300 million in product costs through ENERGY STAR  rebate programs. We also estimate our customers saved over 70 billion gallons of water resulting in over $590 million in water bill savings in fiscal 2015 through the sales of our WaterSense  -labeled bath faucets, showerheads, aerators, toilets and irrigation controllers. We continue to offer store recycling programs nationwide, such as an in-store compact fluorescent light (\"CFL\") bulb recycling program launched in 2008. This service is offered to customers free of charge and is available in all U.S. stores. We also maintain an in-store rechargeable battery recycling program. Launched in 2001 and currently done in partnership with Call2Recycle, this program is also available to customers free of charge in all stores throughout the U.S. Through these recycling programs, in fiscal 2015 we helped recycle over 680,000 pounds of CFL bulbs and over 930,000 pounds of rechargeable batteries collected from our customers. In fiscal 2015 , we also recycled over 170,000 lead acid batteries collected from our customers under our lead acid battery exchange program, as well as over 200,000 tons of cardboard through a nationwide cardboard recycling program across our U.S. stores. We believe our Eco Options  Program and our recycling efforts drive sales, which in turn benefits our shareholders, in addition to our customers and the environment. 4 Interconnecting Retail . A typical The Home Depot store stocks approximately 30,000 to 40,000 products during the year, including both national brand name and proprietary items. To enhance our merchandising capabilities, we continued to make improvements to our information technology tools in fiscal 2015 to better understand our customers, provide more localized assortments to fit customer demand and optimize space to dedicate the right square footage to the right products in the right location. We also continued to use the resources of BlackLocus, Inc., a data analytics and pricing firm we acquired in fiscal 2012, to help us make focused merchandising decisions based on large, complex data sets. Our online product offerings complement our stores by serving as an extended aisle, and we offer a significantly broader product assortment through our Home Depot, Home Decorators Collection and Blinds.com websites. We continue to enhance our websites and mobile experience by improving navigation and search functionalities to allow customers to more easily find and purchase an expanded array of products and provide our customers with flexibility and convenience for their purchases, for example, through our BOPIS, BOSS, BORIS and BODFS programs. In addition, we invest in content, such as videos, room scenes, buying guides and how-to information, and we routinely assess our online assortment to balance choice with curation so that we provide value to our customers. As a result of these efforts, in fiscal 2015 we enhanced the customer experience and saw increased traffic to our websites, improved online sales conversion rates, and a larger percentage of orders being picked up in our stores. For fiscal 2015 , we had over 1.4 billion visits to our online properties; sales from our online channels increased over 25% compared to fiscal 2014; and over 40% of our online orders were picked up in a store. Seasonality. Our business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, and the lowest volume occurs either during our first or fourth fiscal quarter. Competition. Our industry is highly competitive, with competition based primarily on customer service, price, store location and appearance, and quality, availability and assortment of merchandise. Although we are currently the worlds largest home improvement retailer, in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses, and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO companies and, to a lesser extent, other retailers, as well as with installers of home improvement products. In addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers, some of whom may have a lower cost structure than ours, as our customers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products. Intellectual Property. Our business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, e-commerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business, including our expanding proprietary brands such as HDX  , Husky  , Hampton Bay  , Home Decorators Collection  , Glacier Bay  and Vigoro  . We also maintain patent portfolios relating to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our products or business operations. Productivity and Efficiency Driven by Capital Allocation We have advanced this initiative by building best-in-class competitive advantages in our information technology and supply chain to better ensure product availability to our customers while managing our costs, which results in higher returns for our shareholders. During fiscal 2015 , we continued to focus on optimizing our supply chain network and improving our inventory, transportation and distribution productivity. Logistics. Our supply chain operations are focused on creating a competitive advantage through ensuring product availability for our customers, effectively using our investment in inventory, and managing total supply chain costs. One of our principal 2015 initiatives has been to further optimize and efficiently operate our network by beginning initial work on a multi-year program called Supply Chain Synchronization, or \"Project Sync\". Our distribution strategy is to provide the optimal flow path for a given product. Rapid Deployment Centers (\"RDCs\") play a key role in optimizing our network as they allow for aggregation of product needs for multiple stores to a single purchase order and then rapid allocation and deployment of inventory to individual stores upon arrival at the RDC. This results in a simplified ordering process and improved transportation and inventory management. We have 18 mechanized RDCs in the U.S. and two recently opened mechanized RDCs in Canada. Through Project Sync, which is being rolled out gradually to suppliers in several U.S. RDCs, we can significantly reduce our average lead time from supplier to shelf. Project Sync requires deep collaboration among our suppliers, transportation providers, RDCs and stores, as well as rigorous planning and information technology development to create an engineered flow schedule that shortens and stabilizes lead time, resulting in 5 more predictable and consistent freight flow. As we continue to roll out Project Sync throughout our supply chain over the next several years, we plan to create an end-to-end solution that benefits all participants in our supply chain, from our suppliers to our transportation providers to our RDC and store associates to our customers. Over the past several years, we have centralized our inventory planning and replenishment function and continuously improved our forecasting and replenishment technology. This has helped us improve our product availability and our inventory productivity at the same time. At the end of fiscal 2015 , over 95% of our U.S. store products were ordered through central inventory management. In addition to our RDCs, at the end of fiscal 2015 , we operated 34 bulk distribution centers, which handle products distributed optimally on flat bed trucks, in the U.S. and Canada; 22 stocking distribution centers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico; and ten specialty distribution centers, which include offshore consolidation and return logistics centers, in the U.S. and Canada. We also utilize four U.S. transload facilities, operated by third parties near ocean ports, for our imported product. These facilities allow us to improve our import logistics costs and inventory management by postponing final inventory deployment decisions until product arrives at destination ports. We remain committed to leveraging our supply chain capabilities to fully utilize and optimize our improved logistics network. Interconnecting Retail. To support our online growth, in fiscal 2015 we opened the third of our three new direct fulfillment centers (\"DFCs\"). We expect these facilities to enable us to reach 90% of our U.S. customers in two business days or less with parcel shipping, which provides our customers with a balance of cost efficiency and speed in shipping online orders. For non-parcel orders originating from our DFCs, we have fully implemented BOSS via RDC delivery to provide our customers with a less expensive store pick-up alternative. With our acquisition of Interline, we have also added more than 90 distribution points with fast delivery of a broad assortment of MRO products. In addition to the distribution and fulfillment centers described above, we leverage our almost 2,000 U.S. stores as a network of convenient customer pick-up, return and delivery fulfillment locations. For customers who shop online and wish to pick-up or return merchandise at our U.S. stores, we have fully implemented our BOPIS, BOSS and BORIS programs, which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage. For customers who would like the option to have store-based orders delivered directly to their home or job site, we pick, pack and ship orders to customers from our stores. We will continue our roll out of BODFS during fiscal 2016, allowing online customers to select their preferred delivery date and time windows for store-based deliveries. Our supply chain and logistics strategies will continue to be focused on providing our customers high product availability with convenient and low cost fulfillment options. Commitment to Sustainability and Environmentally Responsible Operations . The Home Depot focuses on sustainable operations and is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner. This commitment impacts all areas of our business, including energy usage, supply chain, store construction and maintenance, and, as noted above under \"Environmentally-Friendly Products and Programs\", product selection and recycling programs for our customers. In our 2015 Sustainability Report, available on our corporate website under \"Corporate Responsibility  THD and the Environment\", we reported that we had significantly surpassed our energy and carbon reduction goals set in 2010 and announced two new sustainability goals for 2020. Our 2010 goals were to reduce our kilowatt hours (kWh) per square foot in our U.S. stores by 20% over 2004 levels and to reduce our supply chain carbon emissions by 20% over 2010 levels by 2015. We estimate that we have reduced those levels by over 30% and over 35%, respectively, as of the end of fiscal 2015. From 2014 to 2015 alone, we reduced our kWh per square foot by approximately 3.6%. Our new 2020 sustainability commitments are to reduce our U.S. stores energy use by 20% over 2010 levels and to produce and procure, on an annual basis, 135 megawatts of energy for our stores through renewable or alternate energy sources, such as wind, solar and fuel cell technology. We are committed to implementing strict operational standards that establish energy efficient operations in all of our U.S. facilities and continuing to invest in renewable energy. Our 2015 Sustainability Report also uses the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework for sustainability reporting. Additionally, we implemented a rainwater reclamation project in our stores in 2010. As of the end of fiscal 2015 , 145 of our stores used reclamation tanks to collect rainwater and condensation from HVAC units and garden center roofs, which is in turn used to water plants in our outside garden centers. We estimate our annual water savings from these units to be approximately 500,000 gallons per store for total water savings of over 68 million gallons in fiscal 2015 . Our commitment to corporate sustainability has resulted in a number of environmental awards and recognitions. In 2015, we received three significant awards from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"). The ENERGY STAR  division named us \"Retail Partner of the Year  Sustained Excellence\" for our overall excellence in energy efficiency, and we received the 2015 WaterSense  Sustained Excellence Award for our overall excellence in water efficiency. We also received the EPAs 6 \"SmartWay Excellence Award\", which recognizes The Home Depot as an industry leader in freight supply chain environmental performance and energy efficiency. We also participate in the CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) reporting process. CDP is an independent, international, not-for-profit organization providing a global system for companies and cities to measure, disclose, manage and share environmental information. In 2015, we scored 99 out of 100 from the CDP for our disclosure, placing us among the highest scoring companies in the Index and near the top of our sector. We also were named as an industry leader by the CDP and received a performance band ranking of A- (out of a range from A to E), reflecting a high level of action on climate change mitigation, adaptation and transparency. We are strongly committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates and protecting the environment of the communities in which we do business. Our Environmental, Health  Safety (\"EHS\") function is dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of our customers and associates, with trained associates who evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a Company-wide basis. Our EHS policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of The Home Depot culture. Some common program elements include: daily store inspection checklists (by department); routine follow-up audits from our store-based safety team members and regional, district and store operations field teams; equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety; departmental merchandising safety standards; training and education programs for all associates, with varying degrees of training provided based on an associates role and responsibilities; and awareness, communication and recognition programs designed to drive operational awareness and understanding of EHS issues. Returning Value to Shareholders . As noted above, we drive productivity and efficiency through our capital allocation decisions, with a focus on expense control. This discipline drove higher returns on invested capital and allowed us to return value to shareholders through $7.0 billion in share repurchases and $3.0 billion in dividends in fiscal 2015 , as discussed in Item 7, \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\". Data Breach In the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we confirmed that our payment data systems were breached, which impacted customers who used payment cards at our U.S. and Canadian stores (the \"Data Breach\"). For a description of matters related to the Data Breach, see Item 7, \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\". ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. The risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. You should read these Risk Factors in conjunction with \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item 7 and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item 8. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. We operate in markets that are highly competitive. We compete principally based on customer service, price, store location and appearance, and quality, availability and assortment of merchandise. In each market we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO companies and, to a lesser extent, other retailers, as well as with installers of home improvement products. In addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers, some of whom may have a lower cost structure than ours, as our customers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products in real time. Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect our prices, our margins or demand for our products and services. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through maintenance of customer service and customer relationships to deliver a superior customer experience, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected. 7 We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; consumer preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions, while also managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining an excellent customer experience. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. As the housing and home improvement market continues to recover, resulting changes in demand will put further pressure on our ability to meet customer needs and expectations and maintain high service levels. In addition, each of our primary customer groups  DIY, DIFM and Pro  have different needs and expectations, many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change. If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers. Customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding. Customers are increasingly using technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices, determine real-time product availability and purchase products. Once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products, and they often expect quick and low-cost delivery. We must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. We have implemented programs like BOSS, BOPIS and direct fulfillment, and are rolling out BODFS, but we cannot guarantee that these programs or others we may implement will be implemented successfully or will meet customers needs and expectations. Customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our Company and products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. To the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media, it may impact our brand and reputation. Further, we have an aging store base that requires maintenance and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping environment that our customers desire. Failure to maintain our stores and utilize our store space effectively, to provide a compelling online presence, to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs and to differentiate the customer experience for our three primary customer groups could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs. Our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, or healthcare benefits. An inability to provide wages and/or benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract employees. In addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly if the economy continues to improve and employment opportunities increase. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. We have incurred losses related to our Data Breach, and we are still in the process of determining the full impact of related government investigations and civil litigation on our results of operations, which could have an adverse impact on our operations, financial results and reputation. The Data Breach involved the theft of certain payment card information and customer email addresses through unauthorized access to our systems. Since the Data Breach occurred, we have recorded $161 million of pretax expenses, net of expected insurance recoveries, in connection with the Data Breach, as described in more detail in Item 7, \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\" and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\". We are facing putative class actions filed in the U.S. and Canada and a consolidated shareholder derivative action brought by two purported shareholders in the U.S., and other claims have been and may be asserted on behalf of customers, payment card issuing banks, shareholders, or others seeking damages or other related relief, allegedly arising out of the Data Breach. We are also facing investigations by a number of state and federal agencies. These claims and investigations may adversely affect how we operate our business, divert the attention of management from the operation of the business, have an adverse effect on our reputation, and result in additional costs and fines. In addition, the governmental agencies investigating the Data Breach may seek to impose injunctive relief, which could 8 materially increase our data security costs, adversely impact how we operate our systems and collect and use customer information, and put us at a competitive disadvantage with other retailers. If our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier and Company information are not successful, we could incur substantial additional costs and reputational damage, and could become subject to further litigation and enforcement actions. Our business, like that of most retailers, involves the receipt, storage and transmission of customers personal information, consumer preferences and payment card information, as well as confidential information about our associates, our suppliers and our Company, some of which is entrusted to third-party service providers and vendors. We also work with third-party service providers and vendors that provide technology, systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of this information. Our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third-party service providers or vendors. Hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. We have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss. However, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. Any future significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or Company data, could result in additional significant costs, lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs. We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, PayPal, our private label credit cards and installment loan program, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems, as reflected in our recent Data Breach. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. As a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Uncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. Our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. Adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets or the economy could adversely impact our customers confidence or financial condition, causing them to determine not to purchase home improvement products and services or delay purchasing or payment for those products and services. Other factors beyond our control  including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures; interest rate fluctuations; fuel and other energy costs; labor and healthcare costs; the availability of financing; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; weather; natural disasters and 9 other conditions beyond our control  could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. A failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data. We also rely heavily on the integrity of, security of and consistent access to this data in managing our business. For these systems and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must periodically maintain and update them. Our systems and the third-party systems on which we rely are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; security breaches; cyber-attacks; catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, or hurricanes; acts of war or terrorism; and design or usage errors by our associates, contractors or third-party service providers. Although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, we may not be successful in doing so. As a result, we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. Disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. Through our information technology developments, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and multichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices. We use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales. We have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. Multichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments. For example, to improve our special order process we are currently rolling out COM, our new Customer Order Management system, which our customers will be able to access online, and we continually seek to enhance all of our online properties to provide an attractive user-friendly interface for our customers. Disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. If we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. We buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing, as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by political instability, military conflict, the financial instability of suppliers (particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the world), suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, any disruptions in our suppliers logistics or supply chain networks, and other factors beyond our or our suppliers control. Disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. A disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation. Such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers; weather-related events; natural disasters; trade restrictions; tariffs; third-party strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns; shipping capacity constraints; supply or shipping interruptions or costs; or other factors beyond our control. Any such disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. The implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. We have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology. These initiatives, such as Project Sync and COM, are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to 10 provide high-quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience. The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term and lead to product availability issues. In addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. As part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. We have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. Our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than national brand products, and represent a growing portion of our business. If we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results. Our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks. As we expand our proprietary product offerings, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. The risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and product recall exposure and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. To effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our vendors products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our vendors. Any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategy, which includes the integration of Interline to expand our business with professional customers and in the MRO market, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation. In fiscal 2015, we completed the acquisition of Interline, which we believe will enhance our ability to serve our professional customers and increase our share of the MRO market. Our goal is to serve all of our different Pro customer groups through one integrated approach to drive growth and capture market share in the retail, services and MRO markets, and this strategy depends, in part, on the successful integration of Interline. As with any acquisition, we need to successfully integrate the target companys products, services, associates and systems into our business operations. Integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated synergies or benefits of the Interline acquisition could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation. Furthermore, even if Interline is successfully integrated, the acquisition may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional liabilities associated with the Interline business. If we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits and reputational damage. We act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our DIFM customers through third-party installers. As such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of our third-party installers. We have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. If we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. 11 Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. Recently, there have been a large number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms, as well as expanded enforcement of existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. Changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; cybersecurity and data privacy; the sale of some of our products; transportation; logistics; supply chain transparency; taxes; energy costs or environmental matters could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations. In addition, recent healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates. If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profit margins may be impacted. Our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our U.S. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. Our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations and other legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political and economic conditions. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences, greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights, risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery law compliance, and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers. In addition, our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates, which may adversely impact our sales and profit margins. The inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. Prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. We are involved in a number of legal and regulatory proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. In addition to the matters discussed above with respect to the Data Breach, we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts. Additionally, involvement in these lawsuits, investigations and inquiries, and other proceedings may involve significant expense, divert managements attention and resources from other matters, and impact the reputation of the Company. 12 ", "1B": " Item 1B.

We are reporting the following proceedings to comply with SEC regulations, which require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental provisions if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more. As previously reported, in November 2013, the Company received subpoenas from the District Attorney of Alameda County, California, working with various District Attorneys and the California Attorney Generals office (collectively, the \"District Attorneys\"), seeking documents and information relating to the Companys disposal of hazardous waste at its California facilities. The District Attorneys are currently seeking monetary penalties and certain changes to our operations with respect to the disposal of hazardous waste in California. The Company is cooperating with the District Attorneys in their investigation.

Participants in the Plans may also exercise stock options by surrendering shares of common stock that the participants already own as payment of the exercise price. Shares so surrendered by participants in the Plans are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the Plans and applicable award agreement and not pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) In February 2015, the Board of Directors authorized an $18.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous authorization. The program does not have a prescribed expiration date. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company paid $1.375 billion under an Accelerated Share Repurchase (\"ASR\") agreement and received an initial delivery of 10.1 million shares. The transaction was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, at which time the Company received 1.3 million additional shares to settle the agreement.

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. ##TABLE_END Sales of Unregistered Securities During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 , the Company issued 380 deferred stock units under The Home Depot, Inc. Non-Employee Directors Deferred Stock Compensation Plan pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") and Rule 506 of the SECs Regulation D thereunder. The deferred stock units were credited to the accounts of those non-employee directors who elected to receive all or a portion of board retainers in the form of deferred stock units instead of cash during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 . The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 , the Company credited 17,731 deferred stock units to participant accounts under The Home Depot FutureBuilder Restoration Plan pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for involuntary, non-contributory plans. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan.  ", "6": " Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to page F-1 of this report. 17 ", "7": " Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Executive Summary and Selected Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data Net Sales increased 6.4% to $ 88.5 billion for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 (\"fiscal 2015 \") from $ 83.2 billion for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2015 (\"fiscal 2014 \"). Our total comparable store sales increased 5.6% in fiscal 2015 , driven by a 4.0% increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 1.6% increase in our comparable store average ticket. Comparable store sales for our U.S. stores increased 7.1% in fiscal 2015 . For fiscal 2015 , we reported Net Earnings of $ 7.0 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $ 5.46 compared to Net Earnings of $ 6.3 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $ 4.71 for fiscal 2014 . The results for fiscal 2015 and 2014 included $128 million and $33 million, respectively, of pretax net expenses related to the Data Breach that we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. These charges resulted in decreases of $0.06 and $0.02 to Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The results for fiscal 2015 and 2014 also included a $144 million and a $323 million pretax gain, respectively, related to the sales of our remaining equity ownership in HD Supply Holdings, Inc. (\"HD Supply\"). These gains contributed $0.07 and $0.15 to Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we changed our accounting policy for shipping and handling costs from our stores, locations or distribution centers to customers and for online fulfillment center costs. Under the new accounting policy, these costs are included in Cost of Sales, whereas they were previously included in Operating Expenses. The Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2014 and 2013 have been reclassified to reflect this change in accounting policy. The impact of this reclassification was an increase of $565 million and $475 million to Cost of Sales for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, and a corresponding decrease to Operating Expenses in the same periods. This reclassification had no impact on Net Sales, Operating Income, Net Earnings or Earnings per Share. Data Breach As previously reported, in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we confirmed that our payment data systems were breached, which potentially impacted customers who used payment cards at self-checkout systems in our U.S. and Canadian stores. Since the breach, we completed a major payment security project that provides enhanced encryption of payment card data at the point of sale in all of our U.S. and Canadian stores. We have also rolled out EMV chip card technology in our U.S. stores, which adds extra layers of payment card protection for customers who use EMV enabled chip cards. Our Canadian stores were already enabled with EMV chip card technology. Litigation, Claims and Government Investigations In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the payment card networks made claims against us for costs that they assert they or their issuing banks incurred in connection with the Data Breach, including incremental counterfeit fraud losses and non-ordinary course operating expenses (such as card reissuance costs), and we recorded an accrual for estimated probable losses we expected to incur in connection with those claims. In the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015, we entered into settlement agreements with American Express, Discover, MasterCard and Visa with respect to their claims. In addition, at least 57 putative class actions have been filed in courts in the U.S. and Canada allegedly arising from the Data Breach. The U.S. class actions have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (the \"District Court\"). That court ordered that the individual class actions be administratively closed in favor of the filing of consolidated class action complaints on behalf of customers and financial institutions allegedly harmed by the Data Breach. In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded an accrual for estimated probable losses that we expect to incur in connection with the U.S. customer class actions. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we agreed in principle to settlement terms that, upon the approval of the District Court, will resolve and dismiss the claims asserted in the U.S. customer class actions. The accruals for estimated probable losses in connection with the payment card networks claims and the U.S. customer class actions are based on currently available information associated with those matters. These estimates may change as new information becomes available or circumstances change. Other claims have been and may be asserted against us on behalf of customers, payment card issuing banks, shareholders or others seeking damages or other related relief allegedly arising from the Data Breach. In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, two purported shareholder derivative actions were filed in the District Court against certain present and former members of our 18 Board of Directors and executive officers. We were also named as a nominal defendant in both suits, which together assert claims for breaches of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the two actions were consolidated into a single derivative complaint. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, equitable relief to reform our corporate governance structure, restitution, disgorgement of profits, benefits and other compensation obtained by the defendants, and reasonable costs and expenses. In addition, several state and federal agencies, including State Attorneys General, are investigating events related to the Data Breach, including how it occurred, its consequences and our responses. We are cooperating in the governmental investigations, and we may be subject to fines or other obligations. While a loss from these matters, including the Canadian class actions and the U.S. financial institution class actions, is reasonably possible, we are not able to estimate the costs, or range of costs, related to these matters because the proceedings remain in the early stages, alleged damages have not been specified, there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. We have not concluded that a loss from these matters is probable; therefore, we have not recorded an accrual for litigation, claims and governmental investigations related to these matters in fiscal 2015. We will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. We believe that the ultimate amount paid on these actions, claims and investigations could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods. Expenses Incurred and Amounts Accrued In fiscal 2015 , we recorded $198 million of pretax gross expenses related to the Data Breach, partially offset by $70 million of expected insurance proceeds, for pretax net expenses of $128 million . Since the Data Breach occurred, we have recorded $261 million of pretax gross expenses related to the Data Breach, partially offset by $100 million of expected insurance proceeds, for pretax net expenses of $161 million . These expenses include costs to investigate the Data Breach; provide identity protection services, including credit monitoring, to impacted customers; increase call center staffing; and pay legal and other professional services, all of which were expensed as incurred. Expenses also include the accruals for estimated probable losses that we have incurred or expect to incur in connection with the claims made by the payment card networks and the U.S. customer class actions. These expenses are included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses (\"SGA\") in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Future Costs We expect to incur additional legal and other professional services expenses associated with the Data Breach in future periods and will recognize these expenses as services are received. Costs related to the Data Breach that may be incurred in future periods may include additional liabilities to payment card networks and impacted customers; liabilities from current and future civil litigation, governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings; future expenses for legal, investigative and consulting fees; and incremental expenses and capital investments for remediation activities. We believe that the ultimate amount paid on these services and claims could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods. Insurance Coverage We maintained $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage in fiscal 2014, above a $7.5 million deductible, to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the Data Breach. As of January 31, 2016 , we had received initial payments totaling $30 million of insurance reimbursements under the fiscal 2014 policy, and expect to receive additional payments. We maintained $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage in fiscal 2015, above a $10 million deductible, to limit our exposure to similar losses. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we entered into a new policy, with $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage, above a $10 million deductible, to limit our exposure to similar losses. Key Initiatives In fiscal 2015 , we continued to focus on the following key initiatives: Customer Experience  Our customer experience initiative is anchored on the principles of putting customers first and taking care of our associates. Our commitment to customer service remains strong, and in fiscal 2015, we re-trained our store associates on our Customer FIRST program. We have also taken a number of steps to enhance this initiative to provide our customers with a seamless and frictionless shopping experience in our stores, online, on the job site or in their homes. For example, in fiscal 2015 we utilized our second generation FIRST phones, our web-enabled handheld devices, to enhance customer service in our stores by allowing our associates to convert online sales in the aisle and expedite the checkout process for customers during peak traffic periods. 19 Product Authority  Our product authority initiative is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value. In fiscal 2015 , we continued to introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our do-it-yourself, do-it-for-me and professional customers, while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online. We also continued to utilize our merchandising assortment planning and pricing tools to better understand customer preferences and to refine our product assortment in particular stores or geographic areas. Productivity and Efficiency Driven by Capital Allocation  Our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through continuous operational improvement in the stores and our supply chain, disciplined capital allocation and building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. One of our principal initiatives in fiscal 2015 has been to further optimize and efficiently operate our supply chain by beginning initial work on a multi-year program called Project Sync. Through Project Sync, which is being rolled out gradually to suppliers in several U.S. RDCs, we can significantly reduce our average lead time from supplier to shelf, reduce transportation expenses and improve inventory turns. As we continue to roll out Project Sync throughout our supply chain over the next several years, we plan to create an end-to-end solution that benefits all participants in our supply chain, from our suppliers to our transportation providers to our RDC and store associates to our customers. We repurchased a total of 59 million shares of our common stock for $7.0 billion through ASR agreements and the open market during fiscal 2015 . In addition, in February 2016, we announced a 17% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.69 per share. In fiscal 2015 , we opened four new stores in Mexico and one new store in Canada, for a total store count of 2,274 at the end of fiscal 2015 . As of the end of fiscal 2015 , a total of 297 of our stores, or 13.1% , were located in Canada and Mexico. In August 2015, we completed the acquisition of Interline for $1.7 billion. Interline is a leading national distributor and direct marketer of broad-line MRO products. We intend to leverage Interlines capabilities and expertise in MRO products to expand our share of the MRO product market with our current customers as well as gain new customers currently served by Interline. We generated $9.4 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2015 . This cash flow, along with $4.0 billion of long-term debt issued in fiscal 2015 , was used to fund $7.0 billion of share repurchases, pay $3.0 billion of dividends, purchase Interline for $1.7 billion and fund $1.5 billion in capital expenditures. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.9 times at the end of fiscal 2015 compared to 4.7 times at the end of fiscal 2014 . Our return on invested capital (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 28.0% for fiscal 2015 compared to 24.9% for fiscal 2014 . Interconnecting Retail  Our focus on interconnecting retail is based on building a competitive and seamless platform across all commerce channels. In fiscal 2015 , we continued the pilot of our new COM platform, which we expect to roll out to all U.S. stores by the end of fiscal 2016. We opened and began shipping products from our third new DFC located in Troy Township, Ohio in fiscal 2015. We expect this facility, along with our other two new DFCs in California and Georgia, to enable us to reach 90% of our U.S. customers in two business days or less with parcel shipping. We also began further interconnecting our distribution networks. For non-parcel orders originating from our DFCs, we have fully implemented BOSS via RDC delivery. In fiscal 2015, we began to roll out BODFS, which complements our existing interconnecting retail programs. We plan to complete the roll out of BODFS by the end of fiscal 2016. Additionally, we improved our mobile experience, invested in our digital content and made other site improvements to enhance and simplify the online experience. As a result of these efforts, we increased traffic to our websites, improved our online sales conversion rates, and saw a larger percentage of orders being picked up in our stores. In fiscal 2015, over 40% of our online orders were picked up in our stores through our BOPIS and BOSS offerings. Sales from our online channels increased 25.4% for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, and represented 5.3% of our total Net Sales for fiscal 2015 . 20 We believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations.  ##TABLE_START  % of Net Sales  % Increase (Decrease) In Dollar Amounts  Fiscal Year (1)     vs. 2014  vs. 2013 NET SALES 100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 %  6.4 %  5.5 % GROSS PROFIT 34.2  34.1  34.2  6.6  5.5 Operating Expenses:          Selling, General and Administrative 19.0  19.6  20.5  3.2  1.0 Depreciation and Amortization 1.9  2.0  2.1  3.0  0.8 Total Operating Expenses 20.9  21.5  22.5  3.2  1.0 OPERATING INCOME 13.3  12.6  11.6  12.5  14.2 Interest and Other (Income) Expense:          Interest and Investment Income (0.2 )  (0.4 )    (50.7 )  N/M Interest Expense 1.0  1.0  0.9  10.7  16.7 Interest and Other, net 0.9  0.6  0.9  52.7  (29.5 ) EARNINGS BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 12.5  12.0  10.7  10.5  17.8 Provision for Income Taxes 4.5  4.4  3.9  10.5  17.8 NET EARNINGS 7.9 %  7.6 %  6.8 %  10.5 %  17.8 % SELECTED SALES DATA (2)          Number of Customer Transactions (in millions) 1,500.8  1,441.6  1,390.6  4.1 %  3.7 % Average Ticket $ 58.77  $ 57.87  $ 56.78  1.6 %  1.9 % Sales per Square Foot $ 370.55  $ 352.22  $ 334.35  5.2 %  5.3 % Comparable Store Sales Increase (%) (3) 5.6 %  5.3 %  6.8 %  N/A  N/A Online Sales (% of Net Sales) (4) 5.3 %  4.5 %  3.5 %  25.4 %  36.9 % ##TABLE_ENDNote: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding.   ##TABLE_START (1) Fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 refer to the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 , February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 , respectively.

Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  Net Sales Net Sales for fiscal 2015  increased  6.4% to $88.5 billion from $83.2 billion for fiscal 2014 . The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2015 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth, partially offset by pressure from the strengthening U.S. dollar. Total comparable store sales increased 5.6% for fiscal 2015 . The positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2015 reflect a number of factors, including the execution of our key initiatives, an improved U.S. home improvement market and broad-based growth across our stores. All of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2015 . Comparable store sales for our Tools, Appliances, Plumbing, Dcor, Lighting, Indoor Garden, Building Materials and Hardware product categories were above the Company average for fiscal 2015 . Further, our comparable store customer transactions increased 4.0% for fiscal 2015 and comparable store average ticket increased 1.6% for fiscal 2015 , due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases such as appliances, roofing and several installation service categories, offset in part by the strength of the U.S. dollar. Gross Profit Gross Profit increased  6.6% to $30.3 billion for fiscal 2015 from $28.4 billion for fiscal 2014 . Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.2% for fiscal 2015 compared to 34.1% for fiscal 2014 , an increase of 6 basis points. The increase in gross profit margin for fiscal 2015 reflects benefits from our supply chain driven by lower fuel costs and increased productivity, partially offset by a change in the mix of products sold and the impact of Interline, which has a lower gross profit margin. Operating Expenses SGA increased  3.2% to $16.8 billion for fiscal 2015 from $16.3 billion for fiscal 2014 . SGA for fiscal 2015 included $128 million of pretax net expenses related to the Data Breach compared to $33 million of pretax net expenses for fiscal 2014. As a percent of Net Sales, SGA was 19.0% for fiscal 2015 compared to 19.6% for fiscal 2014 . The decrease in SGA as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2015 reflects strong expense controls and expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment, partially offset by expenses related to the Data Breach. Depreciation and Amortization increased 3.0% to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2015 from $1.6 billion for fiscal 2014 . Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 1.9% for fiscal 2015 compared to 2.0% for fiscal 2014 . The decrease in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2015 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment. Operating Income Operating Income increased  12.5% to $11.8 billion for fiscal 2015 from $10.5 billion for fiscal 2014 . Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 13.3% for fiscal 2015 compared to 12.6% for fiscal 2014 . Interest and Other, net In fiscal 2015 , we recognized $753 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $493 million for fiscal 2014 . Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.9% for fiscal 2015 compared to 0.6% for fiscal 2014 . These results include a $144 million pretax gain in fiscal 2015 related to the sale of our remaining equity ownership in HD Supply compared to a pretax gain of $323 million in fiscal 2014 related to the sales of portions of our equity ownership in HD Supply. Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2015 also reflects additional interest expense associated with $4.0 billion of long-term debt issued in fiscal 2015. Provision for Income Taxes Our combined effective income tax rate was 36.4% for both fiscal 2015 and 2014 . 22 Diluted Earnings per Share Diluted Earnings per Share were $5.46 for fiscal 2015 compared to $4.71 for fiscal 2014 . Expenses related to the Data Breach had a negative impact of $0.06 to Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2015 compared to a negative impact of $0.02 for fiscal 2014. The gains on the sales of our equity ownership in HD Supply contributed a benefit of $0.07 to Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2015 compared to a benefit of $0.15 for fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Net Sales Net Sales for fiscal 2014 increased 5.5% to $83.2 billion from $78.8 billion for fiscal 2013. The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2014 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth. Total comparable store sales increased 5.3% for fiscal 2014. The positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2014 reflect a number of factors, including the execution of our key initiatives, continued strength in our maintenance and repair categories, and an improved U.S. home improvement market. All of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2014. Comparable store sales for our Tools, Appliances, Millwork, Dcor, Plumbing, Lighting, Electrical and Hardware product categories were above or at the Company average for fiscal 2014. Further, our comparable store customer transactions increased 3.5% for fiscal 2014 and comparable store average ticket increased 1.8% for fiscal 2014, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases, such as appliances and water heaters, and sales growth in our services business. Gross Profit Gross Profit increased 5.5% to $28.4 billion for fiscal 2014 from $26.9 billion for fiscal 2013. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.1% for fiscal 2014 compared to 34.2% for fiscal 2013, a decrease of 2 basis points. The decrease in gross profit margin for fiscal 2014 was driven primarily by higher shrink, partially offset by benefits from productivity in our supply chain. Operating Expenses SGA increased 1.0% to $16.3 billion for fiscal 2014 from $16.1 billion for fiscal 2013. SGA for fiscal 2014 included $33 million of pretax net expenses related to the Data Breach. As a percent of Net Sales, SGA was 19.6% for fiscal 2014 compared to 20.5% for fiscal 2013. The decrease in SGA as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2014 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment and strong expense controls, partially offset by expenses related to the Data Breach. Depreciation and Amortization was $1.6 billion for both fiscal 2014 and 2013. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.0% for fiscal 2014 compared to 2.1% for fiscal 2013. The decrease in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2014 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment. Operating Income Operating Income increased 14.2% to $10.5 billion for fiscal 2014 from $9.2 billion for fiscal 2013. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 12.6% for fiscal 2014 compared to 11.6% for fiscal 2013. Interest and Other, net In fiscal 2014, we recognized $493 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $699 million for fiscal 2013. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.6% for fiscal 2014 compared to 0.9% for fiscal 2013. Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2014 included a $323 million pretax gain related to the sales of portions of our equity ownership in HD Supply. This was partially offset by additional interest expense associated with $2.0 billion of long-term debt issued in June 2014. Provision for Income Taxes Our combined effective income tax rate was 36.4% for both fiscal 2014 and 2013. Diluted Earnings per Share Diluted Earnings per Share were $4.71 for fiscal 2014 compared to $3.76 for fiscal 2013. Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2014 reflect $0.15 of benefit from the gain related to the sales of portions of our equity ownership in HD Supply and a negative impact of $0.02 for expenses incurred in connection with the Data Breach. 23 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. For fiscal 2015 , Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $ 9.4 billion compared to $ 8.2 billion for fiscal 2014 . This increase was primarily due to a $664 million  increase in Net Earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense leverage and a $644 million increase in cash flows from Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses related to increased purchases and the timing of payments, partially offset by a $422 million increase in Merchandise Inventories as a result of increased inventory purchases in support of increased sales. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities for fiscal 2015 was $ 3.0 billion compared to $ 1.3 billion for fiscal 2014 . This change was primarily due to $1.5 billion more in Payments for Businesses Acquired, net, related to the acquisition of Interline, and $179 million less in Proceeds from Sales of Investments in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The aggregate purchase price of Interline was $1.7 billion, of which a portion was used for the repayment of substantially all of Interlines existing indebtedness. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities for fiscal 2015 was $5.8 billion compared to $ 7.1 billion for fiscal 2014 . This change was primarily the result of $2.0 billion more of net Proceeds from Long-Term Borrowings, partially offset by $501 million more in Cash Dividends Paid to Stockholders and $230 million less in Proceeds from Short-Term Borrowings, net, in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. In February 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an $18.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous authorization. In fiscal 2015 , we entered into ASR agreements with third-party financial institutions to repurchase $5.2 billion of our common stock. Under the agreements, we paid $5.2 billion to the financial institutions and received a total of 44 million shares in fiscal 2015 . Also in fiscal 2015 , we repurchased 15 million additional shares of our common stock for $1.8 billion through the open market. At January 31, 2016 , $11.0 billion remained under our share repurchase authorization. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our ASR agreements. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2015, in February 2016 we issued $1.35 billion of 2.00% senior notes due April 1, 2021 (the \"2021 notes\") at a discount of $5 million, $1.3 billion of 3.00% senior notes due April 1, 2026 (the \"2026 notes\") at a discount of $8 million, and $350 million of 4.25% senior notes due April 1, 2046 (the \"2046 notes\") at a premium of $2 million (together, the \"February 2016 issuance\"). The 2046 notes form a single series with our $1.25 billion of 4.25% senior notes due April 1, 2046 that were issued in May 2015, and have the same terms. The aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes due April 1, 2046 is $1.6 billion. Interest on the 2021 and 2026 notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2016. Interest on the 2046 notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning April 1, 2016, with interest accruing from October 1, 2015. The net proceeds of the February 2016 issuance were used to repay our 5.40% senior notes due March 1, 2016 (the \"2016 notes\"). As a result, the 2016 notes are classified as Long-Term Debt in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. In September 2015, we issued $500 million of floating rate senior notes due September 15, 2017 (the \"2017 notes\") and $1.0 billion of 3.35% senior notes due September 15, 2025 (the \"2025 notes\") at a discount of $1 million (together, the \"September 2015 issuance\"). The 2017 notes bear interest at a variable rate determined quarterly equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 37 basis points. Interest on the 2017 notes is due quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2015. Interest on the 2025 notes is due semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2016. The net proceeds of the September 2015 issuance were used to fund the acquisition of Interline. In May 2015, we issued $1.25 billion of 2.625% senior notes due June 1, 2022 (the \"2022 notes\") at a discount of $5 million and $1.25 billion of 4.25% senior notes due April 1, 2046 (the \"existing 2046 notes\") at a discount of $3 million (together, the \"May 2015 issuance\"). Interest on the 2022 notes is due semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 2015. Interest on the existing 2046 notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2015. The net proceeds of the May 2015 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock. In June 2014, we issued $1.0 billion of 2.00% senior notes due June 15, 2019 (the \"2019 notes\") at a discount of $4 million and $1.0 billion of 4.40% senior notes due March 15, 2045 (the \"2045 notes\") at a discount of $15 million (together, the \"June 2014 issuance\"). Interest on the 2019 notes is due semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2014. Interest on the 2045 notes is due semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning 24 September 15, 2014. The net proceeds of the June 2014 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock. In fiscal 2015, we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of $1.0 billion , accounted for as cash flow hedges, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of issuing long-term debt to refinance the 2016 notes. At January 31, 2016 , the approximate fair value of these agreements was a liability of $82 million , which is the estimated amount we would have paid to settle the agreements and is included in Other Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with the February 2016 issuance, we paid $89 million in February 2016 to settle the forward starting interest rate swap agreements we entered into in fiscal 2015. In November 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on September 10, 2018 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on our 2.25% senior notes due September 10, 2018 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 88 basis points. At January 31, 2016 , the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $9 million , which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Also in November 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on September 15, 2020 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on our 3.95% senior notes due September 15, 2020 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 183 basis points. At January 31, 2016 , the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $25 million , which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. At January 31, 2016 , we had an outstanding interest rate swap that expired on March 1, 2016 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swapped fixed rate interest on our 2016 notes for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 300 basis points. At January 31, 2016 , the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $9 million , which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement and is included in Other Current Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . All of our short-term borrowings in fiscal 2015 and 2014 were under these commercial paper programs. In connection with these programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . In December 2014, we replaced our back-up credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in July 2017, with a new, substantially identical $2.0 billion credit facility. The new credit facility expires in December 2019 and contains various restrictive covenants. At January 31, 2016 , we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. At January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015, there were $350 million and $290 million , respectively, of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our commercial paper programs and related credit facility. We use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers and store support centers. The net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-Term Debt and Current Installments of Long-Term Debt. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 31, 2016 , we had $2.2 billion in Cash and Cash Equivalents. We believe that our current cash position, access to the long-term debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 25 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of January 31, 2016 (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual Obligations Total   2017-2018  2019-2020  Thereafter Total Debt (1) $ 20,601  $ 3,351  $ 1,650  $ 1,500  $ 14,100 Interest Payments on Debt (2) 14,030   1,544  1,467  10,168 Capital Lease Obligations (3) 1,489     Operating Leases 7,423   1,512  1,167  3,876 Purchase Obligations (4) 1,533  1,224    Unrecognized Tax Benefits (5)        Loss Contingencies (6)          Total $ 45,251  $ 6,591  $ 5,166  $ 4,418  $ 29,076 ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1) Excludes present value of capital lease obligations, fair value of interest rate swaps and unamortized debt discounts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Interest payments are at current interest rates including the impact of active interest rate swaps. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Includes $ 726 million of imputed interest. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, software acquisitions and license commitments and legally binding service contracts.

See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. ##TABLE_END Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. Interest rate swap agreements are used, at times, to manage our fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. At January 31, 2016 , after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, approximately 90% of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate debt and 10% was floating-rate debt. A 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. As of January 31, 2016 we had, net of discounts, $ 20.2 billion of senior notes outstanding. The aggregate market value of these publicly traded senior notes as of January 31, 2016 was approximately $ 21.8 billion . We are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. Revenues from these foreign operations accounted for approximately $ 8.0 billion and $ 8.5 billion of our revenue for fiscal 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. Impact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices We have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates. 26 Revenues We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. We have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. However, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely impacted. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. We also record Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. Merchandise Inventories Our Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, with approximately 71% valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method. Retailers like us, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, Merchandise Inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. We evaluate our inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the end of fiscal 2015 or 2014 . Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, \"swell\") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. We estimate shrink as a percent of Net Sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. The estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2015 , 2014 or 2013 . Self-Insurance We have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability (including product liability), workers compensation, employee group medical and automobile claims for which we are self-insured. Our self-insured retention or deductible, as applicable, for each claim involving general liability, workers compensation and automobile liability is limited to $25 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively. We do not have any stop loss limits for self-insured employee group medical claims. Our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. The liabilities are reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2015 , 2014 or 2013 . We maintain network security and privacy liability insurance coverage to limit our exposure to losses such as those that may be caused by a significant compromise or breach of our data security. This coverage is discussed further in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. We believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors. Volume rebates and certain advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op 27 allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in SGA. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, managements decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, we also recognize in SGA the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of long-lived assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition and inflation. A 10% decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations. Our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations. A 10% decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10% increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations. We recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2015 , 2014 or 2013 . Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. Each year we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments, with a quantitative assessment completed at least once every three years. Our most recent quantitative assessment was completed in fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2015 , we completed our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for our U.S., Canada and Mexico reporting units. We performed qualitative assessments, concluding that the fair value of our reporting units was not more likely than not less than the carrying value. There were no impairment charges related to goodwill for fiscal 2015 , 2014 or 2013 . We amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 12 years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. There were no impairment charges related to our other intangible assets for fiscal 2015 , 2014 or 2013 .

These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and properly reflect certain estimates and judgments based upon the best available information. The financial statements of the Company have been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their accompanying report is based upon an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting solely of independent directors, meets five times a year with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and representatives of management to discuss auditing and financial reporting matters. In addition, a telephonic meeting is held prior to each quarterly earnings release. The Audit Committee retains the independent registered public accounting firm and regularly reviews the internal accounting controls, the activities of the independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors and the financial condition of the Company. Both the Companys independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2016 in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included on page 30 in this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START /s/ C RAIG A.

Tom Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President  Corporate Services ##TABLE_END29 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders The Home Depot, Inc.: We have audited The Home Depot, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Home Depot, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, The Home Depot, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2016 , and our report dated March 24, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/ KPMG LLP Atlanta, Georgia March 24, 2016  30 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders The Home Depot, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2016 . These Consolidated Financial Statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Consolidated Financial Statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2016 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has changed its accounting policy to include shipping and handling costs from the Companys stores, locations or distribution centers to customers and for online fulfillment center costs within cost of sales, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. This change in accounting principle has been retrospectively applied to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal years ended February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), The Home Depot, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 24, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. /s/ KPMG LLP Atlanta, Georgia March 24, 2016 31 THE HOME DEPOT, INC.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ##TABLE_END Business, Consolidation and Presentation The Home Depot, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (the \"Company\"), is a home improvement retailer that sells a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products and lawn and garden products and provides a number of services. The Home Depot stores, which are full-service, warehouse-style stores averaging approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area, stock approximately 30,000 to 40,000 different kinds of products that are sold to do-it-yourself customers, do-it-for-me customers and professional customers. The Company also offers a significantly broader product assortment through its Home Depot, Home Decorators Collection and Blinds.com websites. At the end of fiscal 2015 , the Company was operating 2,274 The Home Depot stores, which included 1,977 stores in the United States, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam (\"U.S.\"), 182 stores in Canada and 115 stores in Mexico. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year is a 52 - or 53 -week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31 . Fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 (\"fiscal 2015 \"), February 1, 2015 (\"fiscal 2014 \") and February 2, 2014 (\"fiscal 2013 \") include 52 weeks. Use of Estimates Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses in preparing these financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Receivables, Short-Term Debt and Accounts Payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments. The fair value of the Companys Long-Term Debt is discussed in Note 11. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Companys cash equivalents are carried at fair market value and consist primarily of money market funds. Accounts Receivable The Company has an agreement with a third-party service provider who directly extends credit to customers, manages the Companys private label credit card program and owns the related receivables. The Company evaluated the third-party entities holding the receivables under the program and concluded that they should not be consolidated by the Company. The agreement with the third-party service provider expires in January 2018 , with the Company having the option, but no obligation, to purchase the receivables at the end of the agreement. The deferred interest charges incurred by the Company for its deferred financing programs offered to its customers are included in Cost of Sales. The interchange fees charged to the Company for the customers use of the cards and any profit sharing with the third-party service provider are included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses (\"SGA\"). The sum of the three is referred to by the Company as \"the cost of credit\" of the private label credit card program. In addition, certain subsidiaries of the Company, including Interline Brands, Inc. (\"Interline\"), extend credit directly to customers in the ordinary course of business. The receivables due from customers were $ 253 million and $ 68 million as of January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 , respectively. The Companys valuation reserve related to accounts receivable was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of the end of fiscal 2015 or 2014 . Merchandise Inventories The majority of the Companys Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, as determined by the retail inventory method. As the inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, the inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Certain subsidiaries, including retail 37 operations in Canada and Mexico, distribution centers and Interline, record Merchandise Inventories at the lower of cost or market, as determined by a cost method. These Merchandise Inventories represent approximately 29% of the total Merchandise Inventories balance. The Company evaluates the inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of the end of fiscal 2015 or 2014 . Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in stores, the Company accrues for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, \"swell\") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. The Company provides for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as for those deferred due to timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Non-U.S. subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, are not eligible to be included in the Companys consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Separate provisions for income taxes have been determined for these entities. The Company intends to reinvest substantially all of the unremitted earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries and postpone their remittance indefinitely. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes on these earnings was recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Depreciation and Amortization The Companys Buildings, Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold Improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the original term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. The Companys Property and Equipment is depreciated using the following estimated useful lives:  ##TABLE_START  Life Buildings 5  45 years Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment 2  20 years Leasehold Improvements 5  45 years ##TABLE_ENDCapitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to six years. Certain development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred. Revenues The Company recognizes revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. The liability for sales returns is estimated based on historical return levels. When the Company receives payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets 38 until the sale or service is complete. The Company also records Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognizes this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. Gift card breakage income is recognized based upon historical redemption patterns and represents the balance of gift cards for which the Company believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote. During fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the Company recognized $ 27 million , $ 32 million and $ 30 million , respectively, of gift card breakage income. This income is included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a reduction in SGA. Services Revenue Net Sales include services revenue generated through a variety of installation, home maintenance and professional service programs. In these programs, the customer selects and purchases material for a project, and the Company provides or arranges professional installation. These programs are offered through the Companys stores and in-home sales programs. Under certain programs, when the Company provides or arranges the installation of a project and the subcontractor provides material as part of the installation, both the material and labor are included in services revenue. The Company recognizes this revenue when the service for the customer is complete. All payments received prior to the completion of services are recorded in Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Services revenue was $ 4.0 billion , $ 3.8 billion and $ 3.5 billion for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Self-Insurance The Company is self-insured for certain losses related to general liability (including product liability), workers compensation, employee group medical and automobile claims. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date is not discounted and is recognized as a liability. The expected ultimate cost of claims is estimated based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. The Company maintains network security and privacy liability insurance coverage to limit the Company's exposure to losses such as those that may be caused by a significant compromise or breach of the Companys data security. This coverage is discussed further in Note 13. Prepaid Advertising Television and radio advertising production costs, along with media placement costs, are expensed when the advertisement first appears. Amounts included in Other Current Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to prepayments of production costs for print and broadcast advertising as well as sponsorship promotions were not material at the end of fiscal 2015 and 2014 . Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and certain advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense. In fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , gross advertising expense was $ 868 million , $ 884 million and $ 865 million , respectively, and is included in SGA. Specific, incremental and identifiable advertising co-op allowances were $ 129 million , $ 125 million and $ 114 million for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and are recorded as an offset to advertising expense in SGA. Cost of Sales Cost of Sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed, the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to the Companys stores, locations or customers, shipping and handling costs from the Companys stores, locations or distribution centers to customers, the operating cost of the Companys sourcing and distribution network, online fulfillment center costs and the cost of deferred interest programs offered through the Companys private label credit card programs. 39 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates its long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, managements decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, the Company also recognizes in SGA the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. The Company recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2015 , 2014 or 2013 . Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. The Company does not amortize goodwill but does assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. Each year the Company may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments, with a quantitative assessment completed at least once every three years. The Companys most recent quantitative assessment was completed in fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2015 , the Company completed its annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for its U.S., Canada and Mexico reporting units. The Company performed qualitative assessments, concluding that the fair value of the reporting units was not more likely than not less than the carrying value. There were no impairment charges related to goodwill for fiscal 2015 , 2014 or 2013 . The Company amortizes the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 12 years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. There were no impairment charges related to other intangible assets for fiscal 2015 , 2014 or 2013 . Stock-Based Compensation The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $ 18.54 , $ 14.13 and $ 13.10 , respectively. The fair value of these options was determined at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  January 31, 2016  February 1, 2015  February 2, 2014 Risk-free interest rate 1.4 %  1.7 %  0.8 % Assumed volatility 20.8 %  22.7 %  26.3 % Assumed dividend yield 2.0 %  2.3 %  2.2 % Assumed lives of options 5 years  5 years  5 years ##TABLE_ENDDerivatives The Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate exposure on long-term debt and its exposure on foreign currency fluctuations. The Company accounts for its derivative financial instruments in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (\"FASB ASC\") Subtopic 815-10. The fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments is discussed in Note 11. 40 Comprehensive Income Comprehensive Income includes Net Earnings adjusted for certain gains and losses that are excluded from Net Earnings under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Adjustments to Net Earnings and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income consist primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses are generally translated using average exchange rates for the period and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the day of the transaction. Segment Information The Company operates within a single reportable segment primarily within North America. Net Sales for the Company outside the U.S. were $ 8.0 billion , $ 8.5 billion and $ 8.5 billion for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Long-lived assets outside the U.S. totaled $ 2.3 billion and $ 2.5 billion as of January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 , respectively. The following table presents the Net Sales of each major product category (and related services) for each of the last three fiscal years (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START Product Category Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016  February 1, 2015  February 2, 2014  Net Sales  % of Net Sales  Net Sales  % of Net Sales  Net Sales  % of Net Sales Indoor Garden $ 8,298  9.4 %  $ 7,560  9.1 %  $ 7,022  8.9 % Paint 7,465  8.4  7,299  8.8  7,018  8.9 Kitchen and Bath 6,874  7.8  6,607  7.9  6,301  8.0 Outdoor Garden 6,565  7.4  6,385  7.7  6,140  7.8 Appliances 6,534  7.4  5,708  6.9  5,382  6.8 Building Materials 6,396  7.2  6,054  7.3  5,728  7.3 Plumbing 6,346  7.2  5,740  6.9  5,435  6.9 Lumber 6,278  7.1  6,050  7.3  5,820  7.4 Flooring 6,194  7.0  5,987  7.2  5,721  7.3 Tools 6,060  6.8  5,388  6.5  5,038  6.4 Electrical 5,833  6.6  5,653  6.8  5,378  6.8 Hardware 5,296  6.0  4,975  6.0  4,718  6.0 Millwork 4,924  5.6  4,694  5.6  4,389  5.6 Dcor 2,757  3.1  2,577  3.1  2,343  3.0 Lighting 2,699  3.0  2,499  3.0  2,379  3.0 Total $ 88,519  100.0 %  $ 83,176  100.0 %  $ 78,812  100.0 % ##TABLE_ENDNote: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842)\" (\"ASU No. 2016-02\"), which requires an entity that is a lessee to recognize the assets and liabilities arising from leases on the balance sheet. This guidance also requires disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, using a modified retrospective approach, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-02 will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, \"Interest  Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\" (\"ASU No. 2015-03\"), which requires an entity to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, 41 consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by this ASU. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter, and retrospective application is required. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The Company does not believe that ASU No. 2015-03 will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-15, \"Interest  Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements\" (\"ASU No. 2015-15\"), which states that ASU No. 2015-03 does not address debt issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements, and therefore the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting these related debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company does not believe that ASU No. 2015-15 will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\" (\"ASU No. 2015-17\"), which requires an entity to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The guidance in this ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company does not believe that ASU No. 2015-17 will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\" (\"ASU No. 2014-09\"), which requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP, and it permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date\" (\"ASU No. 2015-14\"), which delayed the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year. As a result, ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. Reclassifications Certain amounts in prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform with the presentation adopted in the current fiscal year. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. 42 ##TABLE_START 2. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY ##TABLE_END During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company changed its accounting policy for shipping and handling costs from the Companys stores, locations or distribution centers to customers and for online fulfillment center costs. Under the new accounting policy, these costs are included in Cost of Sales, whereas they were previously included in Operating Expenses. Including these expenses in Cost of Sales better aligns these costs with the related revenue in the gross profit calculation. This change in accounting policy has been applied retrospectively. The Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2014 and 2013 have been reclassified to reflect this change in accounting policy. The impact of this reclassification was an increase of $565 million and $475 million to Cost of Sales for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, and a corresponding decrease to Operating Expenses in the same periods. This reclassification had no impact on Net Sales, Operating Income, Net Earnings or Earnings per Share. ##TABLE_START 3. INTERLINE ACQUISITION ##TABLE_END On August 24, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Interline. Interline is a leading national distributor and direct marketer of broad-line maintenance, repair and operations (\"MRO\") products. The Company intends to leverage Interlines capabilities and expertise in MRO products to expand the Companys share of the MRO product market with its current customers as well as gain new customers currently served by Interline. The aggregate purchase price of this acquisition was $1.7 billion . A portion of the purchase price was used for the repayment of substantially all of Interlines existing indebtedness. The acquisition was accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 805 \"Business Combinations\" and, accordingly, Interlines results of operations have been consolidated in the Companys financial statements since the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not material. Pro forma results of operations would not be materially different as a result of the acquisition and therefore are not presented. The Company finalized its purchase price allocation during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition for Interline (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fair Value Cash $ Receivables Inventories Property and Equipment Intangible Assets Goodwill Other Assets Total Assets Acquired 2,049   Current Liabilities Other Liabilities Total Liabilities Assumed   Net Assets Acquired $ 1,672 ##TABLE_ENDThe intangible assets acquired consist of customer relationships of $310 million , with a weighted average useful life of 12 years, and tradenames of $253 million , with an indefinite life, which are included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Goodwill of $788 million represents future economic benefits expected to arise from the Companys expanded presence in the MRO market and expected revenue and purchasing synergies. Both the intangible assets and Goodwill acquired are not deductible for income tax purposes. 43 ##TABLE_START 4. INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY HOLDINGS, INC. ##TABLE_END At the end of fiscal 2013, the Company owned 16.3 million shares of HD Supply Holdings, Inc. (\"HD Supply\") common stock, which represented approximately 8% of the shares of HD Supply common stock outstanding. This investment was accounted for using the cost method, as there were significant restrictions in place on the Companys ability to sell or transfer its HD Supply shares. The restrictions were controlled by the three largest shareholders of HD Supply (the \"Principal Shareholders\") for so long as they continued to own a certain portion of their original holdings of HD Supply. The carrying value of the HD Supply shares was impaired by the Company to a zero cost basis in fiscal 2009. In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, the Principal Shareholders elected to sell shares of HD Supply common stock in a secondary public offering (the \"May 2014 Offering\"). Under the terms of a registration rights agreement among the Company, HD Supply and the Principal Shareholders (the \"Registration Rights Agreement\"), the Company had the right to include a portion of its shares in the May 2014 Offering and elected to do so. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014, two of the Principal Shareholders again elected to sell shares of HD Supply common stock in secondary public offerings, and the Company again exercised its rights under the Registration Rights Agreement to include a portion of its shares in these offerings. As a result of all of these offerings (including an overallotment option exercised during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 by the underwriters of the May 2014 Offering), the Company sold 12.2 million shares of HD Supply common stock in fiscal 2014, for which it received $ 323 million of proceeds and recognized a corresponding gain in fiscal 2014. The total pretax gain of $ 323 million is included in Interest and Investment Income in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2014. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the remaining Principal Shareholder elected to sell shares of HD Supply common stock in a secondary public offering, and the Company again exercised its rights under the Registration Rights Agreement to include its shares in this offering. As a result, the Company sold its remaining 4.1 million shares of HD Supply common stock, for which it received $ 144 million of proceeds and recognized a corresponding gain in fiscal 2015. The total pretax gain of $ 144 million is included in Interest and Investment Income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_START 5. PROPERTY AND LEASES ##TABLE_END Property and Equipment as of January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 consisted of the following (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  January 31, 2016  February 1, 2015 Property and Equipment, at cost:    Land $ 8,149  $ 8,243 Buildings 17,667  17,759 Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment 10,279  9,602 Leasehold Improvements 1,481  1,419 Construction in Progress  Capital Leases 1,020   39,266  38,513 Less Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization 17,075  15,793 Net Property and Equipment $ 22,191  $ 22,720 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company leases certain retail locations, office space, warehouse and distribution space, equipment and vehicles. While most of the leases are operating leases, certain locations and equipment are leased under capital leases. As leases expire, it can be expected that in the normal course of business certain leases will be renewed or replaced. Certain lease agreements include escalating rents over the lease terms. The Company expenses rent on a straight-line basis over the lease term, which commences on the date the Company has the right to control the property. The cumulative expense recognized on a straight-line basis in excess of the cumulative payments is included in Other Accrued Expenses and Other Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total rent expense, net of minor sublease income, for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $ 922 million , $ 918 million and $ 905 million , respectively. Certain store leases also provide for contingent rent payments based on percentages of sales in excess of specified minimums. Contingent rent expense for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was approximately $ 7 million , $ 7 million and $ 5 million , respectively. Real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and operating expenses applicable to the leased property are obligations of the Company under the lease agreements. 44 The approximate future minimum lease payments under capital and all other leases at January 31, 2016 were as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Capital Leases Operating Leases $ $ 2017 804 112 2019 624 127 Thereafter through 2097 3,876 1,489 $ 7,423 Less imputed interest Net present value of capital lease obligations Less current installments Long-term capital lease obligations, excluding current installments $ ##TABLE_ENDShort-term and long-term obligations for capital leases are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in Current Installments of Long-Term Debt and Long-Term Debt, respectively. The assets under capital leases recorded in Property and Equipment, net of amortization, totaled $ 629 million and $ 557 million at January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 , respectively. ##TABLE_START 6. DEBT ##TABLE_END The Company has commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . All of the Companys short-term borrowings in fiscal 2015 and 2014 were under these commercial paper programs. In connection with these programs, the Company has a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . In December 2014, the Company replaced its back-up credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in July 2017 , with a new, substantially identical $2.0 billion credit facility. The new credit facility expires in December 2019 and contains various restrictive covenants. At January 31, 2016 , the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact the Companys liquidity or capital resources. Short-Term Debt under the commercial paper programs was as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  January 31, 2016  February 1, 2015 Balance outstanding at fiscal year-end $  $ Maximum amount outstanding at any month-end $  $ Average daily short-term borrowings $  $ Weighted average interest rate 0.34 %  0.13 % ##TABLE_END45 The Companys Long-Term Debt at the end of fiscal 2015 and 2014 consisted of the following (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  January 31, 2016  February 1, 2015 5.40% Senior Notes; due March 1, 2016; interest payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 $ 3,010  $ 3,026 Floating Rate Senior Notes; due September 15, 2017; interest payable quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15   2.25% Senior Notes; due September 10, 2018; interest payable semi-annually on March 10 and September 10 1,158  1,157 2.00% Senior Notes; due June 15, 2019; interest payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15  3.95% Senior Notes; due September 15, 2020; interest payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15  4.40% Senior Notes; due April 1, 2021; interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1  2.625% Senior Notes; due June 1, 2022; interest payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 1,246   2.70% Senior Notes; due April 1, 2023; interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1  3.75% Senior Notes; due February 15, 2024; interest payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 1,095  1,095 3.35% Senior Notes; due September 15, 2025; interest payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15   5.875% Senior Notes; due December 16, 2036; interest payable semi-annually on June 16 and December 16 2,964  2,963 5.40% Senior Notes; due September 15, 2040; interest payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15  5.95% Senior Notes; due April 1, 2041; interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1  4.20% Senior Notes; due April 1, 2043; interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1  4.875% Senior Notes; due February 15, 2044; interest payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15  4.40% Senior Notes; due March 15, 2045; interest payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15  4.25% Senior Notes; due April 1, 2046; interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 1,247   Capital Lease Obligations; payable in varying installments through January 31, 2055  Other  Total debt 20,965  16,907 Less current installments  Long-Term Debt, excluding current installments $ 20,888  $ 16,869 ##TABLE_ENDSubsequent to the end of fiscal 2015, in February 2016 the Company issued $1.35 billion of 2.00% senior notes due April 1, 2021 (the \"2021 notes\") at a discount of $5 million , $1.3 billion of 3.00% senior notes due April 1, 2026 (the \"2026 notes\") at a discount of $8 million , and $350 million of 4.25% senior notes due April 1, 2046 (the \"2046 notes\") at a premium of $2 million (together, the \"February 2016 issuance\"). The 2046 notes form a single series with the Companys $1.25 billion of 4.25% senior notes due April 1, 2046 that were issued in May 2015, and have the same terms. The aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Companys senior notes due April 1, 2046 is $1.6 billion . Interest on the 2021 and 2026 notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2016. Interest on the 2046 notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning April 1, 2016, with interest accruing from October 1, 2015. The $13 million discount associated with the 2021 and 2026 notes and the $2 million premium associated with the 2046 notes 46 will be amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method. Issuance costs associated with the February 2016 issuance were $17 million and will be amortized over the term of the notes. The net proceeds of the February 2016 issuance were used to repay the Companys 5.40% senior notes due March 1, 2016 (the \"2016 notes\"). As a result, the 2016 notes are classified as Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. In September 2015, the Company issued $500 million of floating rate senior notes due September 15, 2017 (the \"2017 notes\") and $1.0 billion of 3.35% senior notes due September 15, 2025 (the \"2025 notes\") at a discount of $1 million (together, the \"September 2015 issuance\"). The 2017 notes bear interest at a variable rate determined quarterly equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 37 basis points. Interest on the 2017 notes is due quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2015. Interest on the 2025 notes is due semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2016. The net proceeds of the September 2015 issuance were used to fund the Companys acquisition of Interline. The $1 million discount associated with the 2025 notes is being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method. Issuance costs associated with the September 2015 issuance were $7 million and are being amortized over the term of the notes. In May 2015, the Company issued $1.25 billion of 2.625% senior notes due June 1, 2022 (the \"2022 notes\") at a discount of $5 million and $1.25 billion of 4.25% senior notes due April 1, 2046 (the \"existing 2046 notes\") at a discount of $3 million (together, the \"May 2015 issuance\"). Interest on the 2022 notes is due semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 2015. Interest on the existing 2046 notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2015. The net proceeds of the May 2015 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of the Companys common stock. The $8 million discount associated with the May 2015 issuance is being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method. Issuance costs associated with the May 2015 issuance were $19 million and are being amortized over the term of the notes. In June 2014, the Company issued $1.0 billion of 2.00% senior notes due June 15, 2019 (the \"2019 notes\") at a discount of $4 million and $1.0 billion of 4.40% senior notes due March 15, 2045 (the \"2045 notes\") at a discount of $15 million (together, the \"June 2014 issuance\"). Interest on the 2019 notes is due semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2014. Interest on the 2045 notes is due semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2014. The net proceeds of the June 2014 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of the Companys common stock. The $19 million discount associated with the June 2014 issuance is being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method. Issuance costs associated with the June 2014 issuance were approximately $14 million and are being amortized over the term of the notes. The Companys senior notes, other than the 2017 notes, may be redeemed by the Company at any time, in whole or in part, at the redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the Par Call Date, as defined in the respective notes. Additionally, if a Change in Control Triggering Event occurs, as defined in each of the outstanding notes except for the 2016 notes, holders of all notes other than the 2016 notes have the right to require the Company to redeem those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The Company is generally not limited under the indentures governing the notes in its ability to incur additional indebtedness or required to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. Further, while the indentures governing the notes contain various restrictive covenants, none are expected to impact the Companys liquidity or capital resources. In fiscal 2015, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of $1.0 billion , accounted for as cash flow hedges, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of issuing long-term debt to refinance the 2016 notes. At January 31, 2016 , the approximate fair value of these agreements was a liability of $82 million , which is the estimated amount the Company would have paid to settle the agreements and is included in Other Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with the February 2016 issuance, the Company paid $89 million in February 2016 to settle the forward starting interest rate swap agreements it entered into in fiscal 2015. This amount, net of income taxes, will be included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and will be amortized to Interest Expense over the lives of the 2026 notes. At January 31, 2016 , the Company had outstanding cross currency swap agreements with a notional amount of $676 million , accounted for as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency fluctuations on certain intercompany debt. At January 31, 2016 , the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of $170 million , which is the estimated amount the Company 47 would have received to settle the agreements and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. In November 2013, the Company entered into an interest rate swap that expires on September 10, 2018 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on the Companys 2.25% senior notes due September 10, 2018 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 88 basis points. At January 31, 2016 , the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $9 million , which is the estimated amount the Company would have received to settle the agreement and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Also in November 2013, the Company entered into an interest rate swap that expires on September 15, 2020 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on the Companys 3.95% senior notes due September 15, 2020 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 183 basis points. At January 31, 2016 , the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $25 million , which is the estimated amount the Company would have received to settle the agreement and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. At January 31, 2016 , the Company had an outstanding interest rate swap that expired on March 1, 2016 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swapped fixed rate interest on the 2016 notes for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 300 basis points. At January 31, 2016, the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $9 million , which is the estimated amount the Company would have received to settle the agreement and is included in Other Current Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings is net of interest capitalized of $2 million , $2 million and $2 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Maturities of Long-Term Debt are $3.1 billion for fiscal 2016 , $540 million for fiscal 2017 , $1.2 billion for fiscal 2018 , $1.0 billion for fiscal 2019 , $583 million for fiscal 2020 and $14.6 billion thereafter. ##TABLE_START 7. ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ##TABLE_END The Company enters into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (\"ASR\") agreement from time to time with a third-party financial institution to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. Under the ASR agreement, the Company pays a specified amount to the financial institution and receives an initial delivery of shares. This initial delivery of shares represents the minimum number of shares that the Company may receive under the agreement. Upon settlement of the ASR agreement, the financial institution delivers additional shares, with the final number of shares delivered determined with reference to the volume weighted average price per share of the Companys common stock over the term of the agreement, less a negotiated discount. The transactions are accounted for as equity transactions and are included in Treasury Stock when the shares are received, at which time there is an immediate reduction in the weighted average common shares calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share. The following table provides the terms for each of the ASR agreements the Company entered into during the last three fiscal years. Each of these agreements followed the structure outlined above (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START Agreement Date  Settlement Date  Amount  Initial Shares Delivered  Additional Shares Delivered  Total Shares Delivered Q1 2013  Q2 2013  $ 1,500  18.1  2.1  20.2 Q2 2013  Q3 2013  $ 1,700  19.6  2.4  22.0 Q3 2013  Q4 2013  $ 1,500  16.4  3.4  19.8 Q4 2013  Q4 2013  $ 1,500  15.0  3.9  18.9 Q1 2014  Q1 2014  $  9.5  2.6  12.1 Q2 2014  Q3 2014  $ 1,750  16.9  4.5  21.4 Q1 2015  Q1 2015  $  7.0  0.5  7.5 Q2 2015  Q3 2015  $ 1,500  12.0  1.3  13.3 Q3 2015  Q4 2015  $ 1,375  10.1  1.3  11.4 Q4 2015  Q4 2015  $ 1,500  9.7  1.7  11.4 ##TABLE_END48 ##TABLE_START 8.

The reconciliation of the Provision for Income Taxes at the federal statutory rate of 35% to the actual tax expense for the applicable fiscal years was as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  January 31, 2016  February 1, 2015  February 2, 2014 Income taxes at federal statutory rate $ 3,857  $ 3,492  $ 2,964 State income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit   Other, net (154 )  (96 )  (109 ) Total $ 4,012  $ 3,631  $ 3,082 ##TABLE_END49 The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 were as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  January 31, 2016  February 1, 2015 Assets:    Deferred compensation $  $ Accrued self-insurance liabilities  State income taxes  Non-deductible reserves  Net operating losses  Impairment of investment   Other  Total Deferred Tax Assets 1,482  1,470 Valuation Allowance (3 )  (6 ) Total Deferred Tax Assets after Valuation Allowance 1,479  1,464     Liabilities:    Inventory (129 )  (61 ) Property and equipment (1,165 )  (1,156 ) Goodwill and other intangibles (368 )  (161 ) Other (116 )  (234 ) Total Deferred Tax Liabilities (1,778 )  (1,612 ) Net Deferred Tax Liabilities $ (299 )  $ (148 ) ##TABLE_ENDCurrent deferred tax assets and current deferred tax liabilities are netted by tax jurisdiction and noncurrent deferred tax assets and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities are netted by tax jurisdiction, and are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START  January 31, 2016  February 1, 2015 Other Current Assets $  $ Other Assets  Other Accrued Expenses (2 )  (1 ) Deferred Income Taxes (854 )  (642 ) Net Deferred Tax Liabilities $ (299 )  $ (148 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe Company believes that the realization of the deferred tax assets is more likely than not, based upon the expectation that it will generate the necessary taxable income in future periods, and except for certain net operating losses discussed below, no valuation reserves have been provided. At January 31, 2016 , the Company had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, expiring at various dates beginning in 2016 to 2035 . Management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits related to the federal and state net operating losses will be realized. However, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to utilize certain foreign net operating losses. Therefore, a valuation allowance has been provided to reduce the deferred tax asset related to foreign net operating losses to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Total valuation allowances related to foreign net operating losses at January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 were $3 million and $6 million , respectively. 50 The Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on approximately $3.5 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries because of its intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable; however, unrecognized foreign income tax credits would be available to reduce a portion of this liability. The Companys income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. In fiscal 2015, the Company settled its appeal of certain proposed examination adjustments with the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") for fiscal years 2005 through 2007 . One issue remains open for these fiscal years pending negotiations between the U.S. and Mexican tax authorities. The Companys U.S. federal tax returns for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 are currently under examination by the IRS. There are also ongoing U.S. state and local and other foreign audits covering fiscal years 2005 through 2013 . The Company does not expect the results from any income tax audit to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Over the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the resolution of federal and state tax examinations could reduce the Companys unrecognized tax benefits by $175 million . Final settlement of these audit issues may result in payments that are more or less than this amount, but the Company does not anticipate the resolution of these matters will result in a material change to its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Reconciliations of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  January 31, 2016  February 1, 2015  February 2, 2014 Unrecognized tax benefits balance at beginning of fiscal year $  $  $ Additions based on tax positions related to the current year   Additions for tax positions of prior years   Reductions for tax positions of prior years (350 )  (212 )  (41 ) Reductions due to settlements (14 )  (7 )  (12 ) Reductions due to lapse of statute of limitations (7 )  (19 )  (7 ) Unrecognized tax benefits balance at end of fiscal year $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the annual effective income tax rate on Net Earnings was $382 million , $318 million and $344 million as of January 31, 2016 , February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 , respectively. Net adjustments to accruals for interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions resulted in expenses of $5 million , $2 million and $7 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Total accrued interest and penalties as of January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 were $89 million and $104 million , respectively. Interest and penalties are included in Interest Expense and SGA, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 51 ##TABLE_START 9. EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS ##TABLE_END The Home Depot, Inc. Amended and Restated 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (\"2005 Plan\") and The Home Depot, Inc. 1997 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (\"1997 Plan\" and collectively with the 2005 Plan, the \"Plans\") provide that incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares, performance units and deferred shares may be issued to selected associates, officers and directors of the Company. Under the 2005 Plan, the maximum number of shares of the Companys common stock authorized for issuance is 255 million shares, with any award other than a stock option or stock appreciation right reducing the number of shares available for issuance by 2.11 shares. As of January 31, 2016 , there were 138 million shares available for future grants under the 2005 Plan. No additional equity awards could be issued from the 1997 Plan after the adoption of the 2005 Plan on May 26, 2005. Under the terms of the Plans, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options must have an exercise price at or above the fair market value of the Companys stock on the date of the grant. Typically, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options vest at the rate of 25% per year commencing on the first or second anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth anniversary date of the grant. Additionally, certain stock options may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The Company recognized $ 26 million , $ 23 million and $ 24 million of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, related to stock options. Restrictions on the restricted stock issued under the Plans generally lapse according to one of the following schedules: (1) the restrictions on the restricted stock lapse over various periods up to five years, (2) the restrictions on 25% of the restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing upon the associates attainment of age 62, or (3) the restrictions on 25% of the restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing upon the earlier of the associates attainment of age 60 or the tenth anniversary of the grant date. The Company has also granted performance shares under the Plans, the payout of which is dependent on the Companys performance against target average return on invested capital and operating profit over a three-year performance cycle. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The fair value of the restricted stock and performance shares is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and performance shares of $ 180 million , $ 168 million and $ 171 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. In fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , there were an aggregate of 152 thousand , 206 thousand and 223 thousand deferred shares, respectively, granted under the Plans. For associates, each deferred share entitles the individual to one share of common stock to be received up to five years after the grant date of the deferred shares, subject to certain deferral rights of the associate. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to deferred shares of $ 15 million , $ 14 million and $ 14 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The Company maintains two Employee Stock Purchase Plans (\"ESPPs\") (U.S. and non-U.S. plans). The plan for U.S. associates is a tax-qualified plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The non-U.S. plan is not a Section 423 plan. As of January 31, 2016 , there were 22 million shares available under the plan for U.S associates and 19 million shares available under the non-U.S. plan. The purchase price of shares under the ESPPs is equal to 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day of the purchase period, which is a six-month period ending on December 31 and June 30 of each year. During fiscal 2015 , there were 1 million shares purchased under the ESPPs at an average price of $ 102.69 . Under the outstanding ESPPs as of January 31, 2016 , employees have contributed $ 14 million to purchase shares at 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day ( June 30, 2016 ) of the current purchase period. The Company recognized $ 23 million , $ 20 million and $ 19 million of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, related to the ESPPs. In total, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense, including the expense of stock options, restricted stock, performance shares, deferred shares and ESPP shares, of $ 244 million , $ 225 million and $ 228 million , in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. 52 The following table summarizes stock options outstanding at January 31, 2016 , February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 , and changes during the fiscal years ended on these dates (shares in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Number of Shares  Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at February 3, 2013 16,617  $ 34.23 Granted 1,704  69.91 Exercised (4,240 )  31.71 Canceled (122 )  43.80 Outstanding at February 2, 2014 13,959  $ 39.26 Granted 1,912  81.84 Exercised (4,387 )  32.41 Canceled (439 )  56.26 Outstanding at February 1, 2015 11,045  $ 48.68 Granted 1,236  116.20 Exercised (2,578 )  37.53 Canceled (237 )  71.26 Outstanding at January 31, 2016 9,466  $ 59.97 ##TABLE_ENDThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $ 206 million , $ 234 million and $ 181 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. As of January 31, 2016 , there were approximately 9 million stock options outstanding with a weighted average remaining life of six years and an intrinsic value of $ 623 million . As of January 31, 2016 , there were approximately 4 million stock options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $ 36.48 , a weighted average remaining life of four years, and an intrinsic value of $ 347 million . As of January 31, 2016 , there were approximately 8 million stock options vested or expected to ultimately vest. As of January 31, 2016 , there was $ 37 million of unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years. The following table summarizes restricted stock and performance shares outstanding at January 31, 2016 , February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 , and changes during the fiscal years ended on these dates (shares in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Number of Shares  Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at February 3, 2013 13,239  $ 37.18 Granted 3,092  68.44 Restrictions lapsed (5,048 )  30.67 Canceled (827 )  46.53 Outstanding at February 2, 2014 10,456  $ 48.82 Granted 2,963  76.71 Restrictions lapsed (4,119 )  39.90 Canceled (804 )  59.55 Outstanding at February 1, 2015 8,496  $ 61.86 Granted 2,102  111.18 Restrictions lapsed (3,311 )  51.83 Canceled (600 )  77.70 Outstanding at January 31, 2016 6,687  $ 80.90 ##TABLE_ENDAs of January 31, 2016 , there was $ 305 million of unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and performance shares, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years. The total fair value of restricted stock and performance shares vesting during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $ 382 million , $ 334 million and $ 353 million , respectively. 53 ##TABLE_START 10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS ##TABLE_END The Company maintains active defined contribution retirement plans for its employees (the \"Benefit Plans\"). All associates satisfying certain service requirements are eligible to participate in the Benefit Plans. The Company makes cash contributions each payroll period up to specified percentages of associates contributions as approved by the Board of Directors. The Company also maintains a restoration plan to provide certain associates deferred compensation that they would have received under the Benefit Plans as a matching contribution if not for the maximum compensation limits under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company funds the restoration plan through contributions made to a grantor trust, which are then used to purchase shares of the Companys common stock in the open market. The Companys contributions to the Benefit Plans and the restoration plan were $ 186 million , $ 182 million and $ 184 million for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. At January 31, 2016 , the Benefit Plans and the restoration plan held a total of 9 million shares of the Companys common stock in trust for plan participants.  ##TABLE_START 11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ##TABLE_END The fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties. A liabilitys fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, rather than the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers are: ##TABLE_START  Level 1  Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets  Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  Level 3  Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions ##TABLE_ENDAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The assets and liabilities of the Company that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 were as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fair Value at January 31, 2016 Using  Fair Value at February 1, 2015 Using  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Derivative agreements - assets $   $  $   $   $  $  Derivative agreements - liabilities   (82 )         Total $   $  $   $   $  $  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate exposure on long-term debt and its exposure on foreign currency fluctuations. The fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments was measured using level 2 inputs. The Companys derivative agreements are discussed further in Note 6. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets were analyzed for impairment on a nonrecurring basis using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3). Impairment charges related to long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal 2015 and 2014 were not material, as further discussed in Note 1 under the captions \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\" and \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\", respectively. The estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition for Interline were measured using unobservable inputs (level 3). See Note 3 for further discussion of the Interline acquisition. The aggregate fair value of the Companys senior notes, based on quoted market prices, was $ 21.8 billion and $ 19.0 billion at January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 , respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 20.2 billion and $ 16.2 billion at January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 , respectively. 54 ##TABLE_START 12. BASIC AND DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES ##TABLE_END The reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average common shares for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  January 31, 2016  February 1, 2015  February 2, 2014 Weighted average common shares 1,277  1,338  1,425 Effect of potentially dilutive securities:      Stock plans   Diluted weighted average common shares 1,283  1,346  1,434 ##TABLE_ENDStock plans consist of shares granted under the Companys employee stock plans as described in Note 9. Options to purchase 1 million , 1 million and 1 million shares of common stock at January 31, 2016 , February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 , respectively, were excluded from the computation of Diluted Earnings per Share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_START 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ##TABLE_END At January 31, 2016 , the Company was contingently liable for approximately $422 million under outstanding letters of credit and open accounts issued for certain business transactions, including insurance programs, trade contracts and construction contracts. The Companys letters of credit are primarily performance-based and are not based on changes in variable components, a liability or an equity security of the other party. In addition to the Data Breach described below, the Company is involved in litigation arising from the normal course of business. In managements opinion, this litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Data Breach As previously reported, in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company confirmed that its payment data systems were breached, which potentially impacted customers who used payment cards at self-checkout systems in the Companys U.S. and Canadian stores (the \"Data Breach\"). Litigation, Claims and Government Investigations In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the payment card networks made claims against the Company for costs that they assert they or their issuing banks incurred in connection with the Data Breach, including incremental counterfeit fraud losses and non-ordinary course operating expenses (such as card reissuance costs), and the Company recorded an accrual for estimated probable losses it expected to incur in connection with those claims. In the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015, the Company entered into settlement agreements with American Express, Discover, MasterCard and Visa with respect to their claims. In addition, at least 57 putative class actions have been filed in courts in the U.S. and Canada allegedly arising from the Data Breach. The U.S. class actions have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (the \"District Court\"). That court ordered that the individual class actions be administratively closed in favor of the filing of consolidated class action complaints on behalf of customers and financial institutions allegedly harmed by the Data Breach. In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company recorded an accrual for estimated probable losses that it expects to incur in connection with the U.S. customer class actions. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company agreed in principle to settlement terms that, upon approval of the District Court, will resolve and dismiss the claims asserted in the U.S. customer class actions. The accruals for estimated probable losses in connection with the payment card networks claims and the U.S. customer class actions are based on currently available information associated with those matters. These estimates may change as new information becomes available or circumstances change. Other claims have been and may be asserted against the Company on behalf of customers, payment card issuing banks, shareholders or others seeking damages or other related relief allegedly arising from the Data Breach. In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, two purported shareholder derivative actions were filed in the District Court against certain present and former 55 members of the Companys Board of Directors and executive officers. The Company was also named as a nominal defendant in both suits, which together assert claims for breaches of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the two actions were consolidated into a single derivative complaint. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, equitable relief to reform the Companys corporate governance structure, restitution, disgorgement of profits, benefits and other compensation obtained by the defendants, and reasonable costs and expenses. In addition, several state and federal agencies, including State Attorneys General, are investigating events related to the Data Breach, including how it occurred, its consequences and the Companys responses. The Company is cooperating in the governmental investigations, and the Company may be subject to fines or other obligations. While a loss from these matters, including the Canadian class actions and the U.S. financial institution class actions, is reasonably possible, the Company is not able to estimate the costs, or range of costs, related to these matters because the proceedings remain in the early stages, alleged damages have not been specified, there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. The Company has not concluded that a loss from these matters is probable; therefore, the Company has not recorded an accrual for litigation, claims and governmental investigations related to these matters in fiscal 2015. The Company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The Company believes that the ultimate amount paid on these actions, claims and investigations could have an adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods. Expenses Incurred and Amounts Accrued In fiscal 2015, the Company recorded $198 million of pretax gross expenses related to the Data Breach, partially offset by $70 million of expected insurance proceeds, for pretax net expenses of $128 million . Since the Data Breach occurred, the Company has recorded $261 million of pretax gross expenses related to the Data Breach, partially offset by $100 million of expected insurance proceeds, for pretax net expenses of $161 million . These expenses include costs to investigate the Data Breach; provide identity protection services, including credit monitoring, to impacted customers; increase call center staffing; and pay legal and other professional services, all of which were expensed as incurred. Expenses also include the accruals for estimated probable losses that the Company has incurred or expects to incur in connection with the claims made by the payment card networks and the U.S. customer class actions. These expenses are included in SGA expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At January 31, 2016 , accrued liabilities and insurance receivable related to the Data Breach consisted of the following (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Accrued Liabilities  Insurance Receivable (Expenses incurred) insurance receivable recorded in fiscal 2014 $ (63 )  $ Payments made (received) in fiscal 2014  (10 ) Balance at February 1, 2015 (12 )  (Expenses incurred) insurance receivable recorded in fiscal 2015 (198 )  Payments made (received) in fiscal 2015  (20 ) Balance at January 31, 2016 $ (34 )  $ ##TABLE_ENDFuture Costs The Company expects to incur additional legal and other professional services expenses associated with the Data Breach in future periods and will recognize these expenses as services are received. Costs related to the Data Breach that may be incurred in future periods may include additional liabilities to payment card networks and impacted customers; liabilities from current and future civil litigation, governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings; future expenses for legal, investigative and consulting fees; and incremental expenses and capital investments for remediation activities. The Company believes that the ultimate amount paid on these services and claims could have an adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods. 56 Insurance Coverage The Company maintained $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage in fiscal 2014, above a $7.5 million deductible, to limit the Companys exposure to losses such as those related to the Data Breach. As of January 31, 2016 , the Company had received initial payments totaling $30 million of insurance reimbursements under the fiscal 2014 policy, and expects to receive additional payments. The Company maintained $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage in fiscal 2015, above a $10 million deductible, to limit the Companys exposure to similar losses. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company entered into a new policy, with $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage, above a $10 million deductible, to limit the Companys exposure to similar losses. ##TABLE_START 14.

Business. Introduction The Home Depot, Inc. is the worlds largest home improvement retailer based on Net Sales for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2017 (\"fiscal 2016 \"). The Home Depot sells a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products and lawn and garden products and provides a number of services. The Home Depot stores average approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. As of the end of fiscal 2016 , we had 2,278 The Home Depot stores located throughout the United States, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam, Canada and Mexico. When we refer to \"The Home Depot\", the \"Company\", \"we\", \"us\" or \"our\" in this report, we are referring to The Home Depot, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Home Depot, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1978. Our Store Support Center (corporate office) is located at 2455 Paces Ferry Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Our telephone number is (770) 433-8211. Our internet website is www.homedepot.com. We make available on the Investor Relations section of our website, free of charge, our Annual Reports to shareholders, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such documents with, or furnishing such documents to, the SEC. We include our website addresses throughout this filing for reference only. The information contained on our websites is not incorporated by reference into this report. For information on key financial highlights, including historical revenues, profits and total assets, see the \"Five-Year Summary of Financial and Operating Results\" on page F-1 of this report and Item 7, \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\". 1 Our Business Operating Strategy  Our strategic framework is founded on our three-legged stool of customer experience, product authority, and productivity and efficiency driven by effective capital allocation, all united by the goal of providing an interconnected retail experience to drive value for our customers, our associates, our suppliers and our shareholders. The retail landscape is rapidly evolving, and our goal is to become more agile in responding to the changing competitive landscape and customer preferences. As customers increasingly expect to be able to buy how, when and where they want, we believe that providing a seamless and frictionless shopping experience across multiple channels, featuring innovative and curated product choices delivered in a fast and cost-efficient manner, will be a key enabler for future success. Becoming a best-in-class interconnected retailer is growing in importance as the line between online and in-store shopping continues to blur and customers demand increased convenience and value. Under customer experience, we are focused on connecting our associates to customer needs and connecting our stores to our online experience. Under product authority, we are focused on connecting our product and services to customer needs, including offering local and customized assortments to meet the unique needs of our different communities. Under productivity and efficiency, we are focused on connecting our merchandise from our suppliers to our customers by optimizing our supply chain. Overall, we are collaborating more closely throughout our organization and with our business partners to build an interconnected experience for customers that offers an end-to-end solution for their home improvement needs. Customer Experience Customer experience is anchored on the principles of putting customers first and taking care of our associates. Our commitment to customer service has been and will continue to be a key part of the customer experience. But we recognize that the customer experience includes more than just customer service, and we have taken a number of steps to provide our customers with a seamless and frictionless shopping experience in our stores, online, on the job site or in their homes. Our Customers . We serve three primary customer groups, and we have different approaches to meet their particular needs: ##TABLE_START  Do-It-Yourself (\"DIY\") Customers. These customers are typically home owners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. Our associates assist these customers with specific product and installation questions both in our stores and through online resources and other media designed to provide product and project knowledge. We also offer a variety of clinics and workshops both to impart this knowledge and to build an emotional connection with our DIY customers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Do-It-For-Me (\"DIFM\") Customers. These customers are typically home owners who purchase materials and hire third parties to complete the project or installation. Our stores offer a variety of installation services available to DIFM customers who purchase products and installation of those products from us in our stores, online or in their homes through in-home consultations. Our installation programs include many categories, such as flooring, cabinets, countertops, water heaters and sheds. In addition, we provide third-party professional installation in a number of categories sold through our in-home sales programs, such as roofing, siding, windows, cabinet refacing, furnaces and central air systems. This customer group is growing due to changing demographics, which we believe will increase demand for our installation services. Further, our focus on serving the professional customers, or \"Pros\", who perform these services for our DIFM customers will help us drive higher product sales. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Professional Customers . These customers are primarily professional renovators/remodelers, general contractors, handymen, property managers, building service contractors and specialty tradesmen, such as installers. We recognize the great value our Pro customers provide to their clients, and we strive to make the Pros job easier. For example, we offer our Pros a wide range of special programs such as delivery and will-call services, dedicated sales and service staff, enhanced credit programs, designated parking spaces close to store entrances and bulk pricing programs for both online and in-store purchases. In addition, we maintain a loyalty program, Pro Xtra, that provides our Pros with discounts on useful business services, exclusive product offers and a purchase tracking tool to enable receipt lookup online and job tracking of purchases across all forms of payment. ##TABLE_END With our acquisition of Interline Brands, Inc. (\"Interline\") in August 2015, we established a platform in the maintenance, repair and operations (\"MRO\") market where we serve primarily institutional customers (such as educational and healthcare institutions), hospitality businesses, and national apartment complexes. We also gained additional competencies relevant to our large professional customers, including outside sales and account management, expanded assortment of product, expanded financing options and last mile delivery capabilities. 2 We recognize that our Pros have differing needs depending on the type of work they perform. Our goal is to develop a comprehensive set of capabilities for our professional customers to provide solutions across every purchase opportunity, such as supplying both recurring MRO needs and renovation products and services to property managers or providing inventory management solutions for specialty tradesmens replenishment needs. We believe that by bringing our best resources to bear for each individual customer, we can provide a differentiated customer experience and enhanced value proposition for our professional customers. We help our DIY, DIFM and Pro customers finance their projects by offering private label credit products through third-party credit providers. Our private label credit program includes other benefits, such as a 365-day return policy and, for our Pros, commercial fuel rewards and extended payment terms. In fiscal 2016 , our customers opened approximately 4.2 million new The Home Depot private label credit accounts, and at fiscal year end the total number of The Home Depot active account holders was approximately 13 million. Private label credit card sales accounted for approximately 23% of sales in fiscal 2016 . Our Associates. Our associates are key to our customer experience. We empower our associates to deliver excellent customer service, and we strive to remove complexity and inefficient processes from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers. In fiscal 2016 , we continued to implement new initiatives to improve freight handling in the stores, as well as Project Sync, which is discussed in more detail below under \"Logistics\". All of these programs are designed to make our freight handling process more efficient, which allows our associates to devote more time to the customer experience and makes working at The Home Depot a better experience for them. We also have a number of programs to recognize stores and individual associates for exceptional customer service. At the end of fiscal 2016 , we employed approximately 406,000 associates, of whom approximately 27,000 were salaried, with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis. To attract and retain qualified personnel, we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve. We measure associate satisfaction regularly, and we believe that our employee relations are very good. Interconnected Retail . In fiscal 2016 , we continued to enhance our customers interconnected shopping experiences through a variety of initiatives. Our associates continued to use FIRST phones, our web-enabled handheld devices, to help customers complete online sales in the aisle, expedite the checkout process for customers during peak traffic periods, locate products in the aisles and online, and check inventory on hand. We have also empowered our customers with improved product location and inventory availability tools on our website and mobile app. During fiscal 2016 , we launched a redesign of our website to provide our customers with better search capabilities and a faster checkout experience, and we upgraded our mobile app. Enhancements to our online and mobile properties are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers who research products online and then go into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate before making the purchase. While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews, compare prices, view our extended assortment and purchase products. We also recognize that customers desire greater flexibility and convenience when it comes to receiving their products and services. We strive to deliver on this customer expectation by blending the physical and digital channels into a seamless customer experience. A key component of this strategy is enabled through our new Customer Order Management platform (\"COM\"), which we rolled out to all U.S. stores in fiscal 2016 . COM provides a common management system for customer orders, providing greater visibility and a more seamless and frictionless experience for our customers and associates. COM also provides the foundation for the enhanced delivery option we rolled out to all U.S. stores in fiscal 2016 : Buy Online, Deliver From Store (\"BODFS\"). BODFS allows customers to schedule a specific delivery window, and it complements our existing interconnected retail programs: Buy Online, Pick-up In Store (\"BOPIS\"), Buy Online, Ship to Store (\"BOSS\") and Buy Online, Return In Store (\"BORIS\"). During the year, we also enabled a dynamic ETA (estimated time of arrival) feature for online orders, which provides our customers with a faster and more accurate delivery date based on their location. We do not view the customer experience as a specific transaction; rather, it encompasses an entire process from inspiration and know-how, to purchase and fulfillment, to post-purchase care and support. Further, we believe that by connecting our stores to online and online to our stores, we drive sales not just in-store but also online. In fiscal 2016 , we saw increased traffic to our online properties and improved online sales conversion rates. Sales from our online channels increased over 19% compared to fiscal 2015. We will continue to blend our physical and digital assets in a seamless and frictionless way to enhance the end-to-end customer experience. 3 Product Authority Product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value. In fiscal 2016 , we continued to introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our DIY, DIFM and Pro customers, while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online. Our Products. A typical The Home Depot store stocks approximately 30,000 to 40,000 products during the year, including both national brand name and proprietary items. To enhance our merchandising capabilities, we continued to make improvements to our information technology tools in fiscal 2016 to better understand our customers, provide more localized assortments to fit customer demand and optimize space to dedicate the right square footage to the right products in the right location. Our online product offerings complement our stores by serving as an extended aisle, and we offer a significantly broader product assortment through our websites, including homedepot.com and Blinds.com. We also routinely use our merchandising tools to refine our online assortment to balance the extended choice with a more curated offering. In fiscal 2016 , we introduced a number of innovative and distinctive products to our customers at attractive values. Examples of these new products include Feit  LED Edge-Lit flat panel lighting; Pergo  Outlast+ flooring; Thomasville  Studio 1904 kitchen cabinets; DEWALT FLEXVOLT  system for power tools; Diablo  carbide hole saws; Defiant  LED security lights; Makita  subcompact drills; and Milwaukee M18 FUEL  with ONE KEY power tools, compatible with the HIGH DEMAND 9.0Ah battery. During fiscal 2016 , we continued to offer value to our customers through our proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments. Highlights of these offerings include Husky  hand tools, tool storage and work benches; Everbilt  hardware and fasteners; Hampton Bay  lighting, ceiling fans and patio furniture; Vigoro  lawn care products; RIDGID  and Ryobi  power tools; Glacier Bay  bath fixtures; HDX  storage and cleaning products; and Home Decorators Collection  furniture and home dcor. We will continue to assess departments and categories, both online and in-store, for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within The Home Depots portfolio of proprietary and exclusive brands. We maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality and innovative products directly from manufacturers around the world. In fiscal 2016 , in addition to our U.S. sourcing operations, we maintained sourcing offices in Mexico, Canada, China, India, Southeast Asia and Europe. The percentage of Net Sales of each of our major product categories (and related services) for each of the last three fiscal years is presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\". Net Sales inside the U.S. were $86.6 billion , $80.5 billion and $74.7 billion for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Net Sales outside the U.S. were $8.0 billion , $8.0 billion and $8.5 billion for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Long-lived assets, which consist of net property and equipment, inside the U.S. totaled $19.5 billion , $19.9 billion and $20.2 billion as of January 29, 2017 , January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 , respectively. Long-lived assets outside the U.S. totaled $2.4 billion , $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion as of January 29, 2017 , January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 , respectively. Quality Assurance . Our suppliers are obligated to ensure that their products comply with applicable international, federal, state and local laws. In addition, we have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to establishing criteria and overseeing compliance with safety, quality and performance standards for our proprietary branded products. We also have a global Supplier Social and Environmental Responsibility Program designed to ensure that suppliers adhere to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility. Environmentally-Preferred Products and Programs. The Home Depot is committed to sustainable business practices  from the environmental impact of our operations, to our sourcing activities, to our involvement within the communities in which we do business. We believe these efforts continue to be successful in creating value for our customers and shareholders. For example, we offer a growing selection of environmentally-preferred products, which supports sustainability and helps our customers save energy, water and money. Through our Eco Options  Program introduced in 2007, we have created product categories that allow customers to easily identify products that meet specifications for energy efficiency, water conservation, healthy home, clean air and sustainable forestry. As of the end of fiscal 2016 , our Eco Options  Program included over 10,000 products. Through this program, we sell ENERGY STAR  certified appliances, LED light bulbs, tankless water heaters and other products that enable our customers to save on their utility bills. We estimate that in fiscal 2016 we helped customers save over $900 million in electricity costs through sales of ENERGY STAR  certified products. We also estimate our customers saved over 76 billion gallons of water resulting in over $640 million in water bill savings in fiscal 2016 through the sales of our WaterSense  -labeled bath faucets, showerheads, aerators, toilets and irrigation controllers. Our 2016 4 Responsibility Report, available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility, describes many of our other environmentally-preferred products that promote energy efficiency, water conservation, clean air and a healthy home. We continue to offer store recycling programs nationwide, such as an in-store compact fluorescent light (\"CFL\") bulb recycling program launched in 2008. This service is offered to customers free of charge and is available in all U.S. stores. We also maintain an in-store rechargeable battery recycling program. Launched in 2001 and currently done in partnership with Call2Recycle, this program is also available to customers free of charge in all stores throughout the U.S. Through our recycling programs, in fiscal 2016 we helped recycle over 860,000 pounds of CFL bulbs and over 1 million pounds of rechargeable batteries. In fiscal 2016 , we also recycled over 180,000 lead acid batteries collected from our customers under our lead acid battery exchange program, as well as over 225,000 tons of cardboard through a nationwide cardboard recycling program across our U.S. operations. We believe our environmentally-preferred product selection and our recycling efforts drive sales, which in turn benefits our shareholders, in addition to our customers and the environment. Seasonality. Our business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, and the lowest volume occurs either during our first or fourth fiscal quarter. Competition. Our industry is highly competitive, with competition based primarily on customer experience, price, store location and appearance, and quality, availability, assortment and presentation of merchandise. Although we are currently the worlds largest home improvement retailer, in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses, and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO companies and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services. In addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers, some of whom may have a lower cost structure than ours, as our customers now routinely use computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products. Intellectual Property. Our business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, e-commerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business, including our expanding proprietary brands such as HDX  , Husky  , Hampton Bay  , Home Decorators Collection  , Glacier Bay  and Vigoro  . We also maintain patent portfolios relating to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our products or business operations. Productivity and Efficiency Driven by Capital Allocation We continue to drive productivity and efficiency by building best-in-class competitive advantages in our information technology and supply chain to ensure product availability for our customers while managing our costs, which results in higher returns for our shareholders. During fiscal 2016 , we continued to focus on optimizing our end-to-end supply chain network and improving our inventory, transportation and distribution productivity. Logistics. We continue to invest in our supply chain by optimizing our network through initiatives like Supply Chain Synchronization, or \"Project Sync\". As described in more detail below, Project Sync is a recent initiative to improve our in-stock rates, inventory productivity and logistics costs. During fiscal 2016, we rolled out the first phase of Project Sync to all U.S. stores, and we continue to onboard new suppliers. This is a multi-year, multi-phase endeavor, which we plan to implement in each of our distribution flow paths. Our overall distribution strategy is to provide the optimal flow path for a given product. Rapid Deployment Centers (\"RDCs\") play a key role in optimizing our network as they allow for aggregation of product needs for multiple stores to a single purchase order and then rapid allocation and deployment of inventory to individual stores upon arrival at the RDC. This results in a simplified ordering process and improved transportation and inventory management. Through Project Sync, we can significantly reduce our average lead time from supplier to shelf. Project Sync requires deep collaboration among our suppliers, transportation providers, RDCs and stores, as well as rigorous planning and information technology development to create an engineered flow schedule that shortens and stabilizes lead time, resulting in more predictable and consistent freight flow. As we continue to roll out Project Sync throughout our supply chain over the next several years, we plan to create an end-to-end solution that benefits all participants in our supply chain, from our suppliers to our transportation providers to our RDC and store associates to our customers. Over the past several years, we have centralized our inventory planning and replenishment function and continuously improved our forecasting and replenishment technology. This has helped us improve our product availability and our 5 inventory productivity at the same time. At the end of fiscal 2016 , over 95% of our U.S. store products were ordered through central inventory management. We operate multiple distribution center platforms tailored to meet the needs of our stores and customers, based on the types of products, local geography, and transportation and delivery requirements. The following table sets forth the number and type of distribution centers in our network as of the end of fiscal 2016 : ##TABLE_START Facility Purpose Number of Facilities U.S. Canada Mexico Rapid Deployment Centers (\"RDCs\") Flow through centers that enable last minute allocation of incoming product to stores   Bulk Distribution Centers (\"BDCs\") Handle products distributed optimally on flat bed trucks 4  Stocking Distribution Centers (\"SDCs\") Handle imported, \"big and bulky\" and special event products 1  Specialty Distribution Centers Include offshore consolidation, return logistics centers and cross-dock operations 1  Transload Facilities Operated by third parties near ocean ports to handle imported product that is later shipped to RDCs or SDCs   Direct Fulfillment Centers (\"DFCs\") Stock and handle product for online orders 2  Stock-Flow Centers Unique to Canada, combine both RDC and SDC capabilities   Multi-Channel Distribution Centers Unique to Mexico, combine RDC, BDC and SDC capabilities   ##TABLE_ENDTo better serve our online customers, we offer a variety of delivery methods to get product to each customers preferred location. We completed the rollout of three new U.S. DFCs in fiscal 2015 to support our online growth. We also operate one DFC for our Home Decorators Collection orders and one DFC for \"big and bulky\" orders. Our DFCs enable us to reduce delivery costs and lead time, and improve the overall customer experience by shipping online orders directly to the customer. In addition, with our acquisition of Interline in fiscal 2015, we added more than 100 distribution points with fast delivery of a broad assortment of MRO products. We remain committed to leveraging our supply chain capabilities to fully utilize and optimize our improved logistics network. In addition to the distribution and fulfillment centers described above, we leverage our almost 2,000 U.S. stores as a network of convenient customer pick-up, return and delivery fulfillment locations. For customers who shop online and wish to pick-up or return merchandise at our U.S. stores, we have fully implemented our BOPIS, BOSS and BORIS programs, which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, approximately 45% of our online U.S. orders were picked up in a store. For customers who would like the option to have store-based orders delivered directly to their home or job site, we pick, pack and ship orders to customers from our stores. Our BODFS program, which we rolled out in fiscal 2016, allows our customers to select their preferred delivery date and time windows for store-based deliveries. Our supply chain and logistics strategies will continue to be focused on providing our customers high product availability with convenient and low cost fulfillment options. Commitment to Sustainability and Environmentally Responsible Operations . The Home Depot focuses on sustainable operations and is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner. This commitment impacts all areas of our business, including energy usage, supply chain and packaging, store construction and maintenance, and, as noted above under \"Environmentally-Preferred Products and Programs\", product selection and recycling programs for our customers. In 2015, we announced two major sustainability commitments for 2020. Our first goal is to reduce our U.S. stores energy use by 20% over 2010 levels, and our second goal is to produce and procure, on an annual basis, 135 megawatts of energy for our stores through renewable or alternate energy sources, such as wind, solar and fuel cell technology. As of the end of fiscal 2016, we are on track to exceed both of our goals before the end of 2020. We are committed to implementing strict operational standards that establish energy efficient operations in all of our U.S. facilities and continuing to invest in renewable energy. 6 Additionally, we implemented a rainwater reclamation project in our stores in 2010. As of the end of fiscal 2016 , 145 of our stores used reclamation tanks to collect rainwater and condensation from HVAC units and garden center roofs, which is in turn used to water plants in our outside garden centers. We estimate our annual water savings from these units to be over 500,000 gallons per store for total water savings of over 72.5 million gallons in fiscal 2016 . Our 2016 Responsibility Report, which uses the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework for sustainability reporting, provides more information on sustainability efforts in other aspects of our operations. Our 2016 Responsibility Report is available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility. Our commitment to corporate sustainability has resulted in a number of environmental awards and recognitions. In 2016, we received three significant awards from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"). The ENERGY STAR  division named us \"Retail Partner of the Year  Sustained Excellence\" for our overall excellence in energy efficiency, and we received the 2016 WaterSense  Sustained Excellence Award for our overall excellence in water efficiency. We also received the EPAs \"SmartWay Excellence Award\", which recognizes The Home Depot as an industry leader in freight supply chain environmental performance and energy efficiency. We also participate in the CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) reporting process. CDP is an independent, international, not-for-profit organization providing a global system for companies and cities to measure, disclose, manage and share environmental information. In 2016, we received a score of A- (out of a range from A to E) from the CDP, reflecting a high level of action on climate change mitigation, adaptation and transparency. We also were named an industry leader by the CDP. We are strongly committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates. Our Environmental, Health  Safety (\"EHS\") function is dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of our customers and associates, with trained associates who evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a Company-wide basis. Our EHS policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of The Home Depot culture. Some common program elements include: daily store inspection checklists (by department); routine follow-up audits from our store-based safety team members and regional, district and store operations field teams; equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety; departmental merchandising safety standards; training and education programs for all associates, with varying degrees of training provided based on an associates role and responsibilities; and awareness, communication and recognition programs designed to drive operational awareness and understanding of EHS issues. Returning Value to Shareholders . As noted above, we drive productivity and efficiency through our capital allocation decisions, with a focus on expense control. This discipline drove higher returns on invested capital and allowed us to return value to shareholders through $7.0 billion in share repurchases and $3.4 billion in dividends in fiscal 2016 , as discussed in Item 7, \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\". ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. The risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. You should read these Risk Factors in conjunction with \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item 7 and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item 8. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. We operate in markets that are highly competitive. We compete principally based on customer experience, price, store location and appearance, and quality, availability, assortment and presentation of merchandise. In each market we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO companies and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services. In addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers, some of whom may have a lower cost structure than ours, as our customers now routinely use computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products in real time. We use our marketing, advertising and promotional programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively, and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape. Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors, such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events, or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect our prices, our 7 margins or demand for our products and services. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through the delivery of a superior customer experience or maintenance of effective marketing, advertising or promotional programs, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; consumer preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions, while also managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining an excellent customer experience. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. As we continue to see increasing strength in the housing and home improvement market, resulting changes in demand will put further pressure on our ability to meet customer needs and expectations and maintain high service levels. In addition, each of our primary customer groups  DIY, DIFM and Pro  have different needs and expectations, many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change. We also need to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group. If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of  or within  a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers. Customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding. Customers now routinely use technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices, determine real-time product availability and purchase products. Once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products, and they often expect quick and low-cost delivery. We must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. We have implemented programs like BOSS, BOPIS, BODFS and direct fulfillment, but we cannot guarantee that these programs or others we may implement will be implemented successfully or will meet customers needs and expectations. Customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our Company and products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. To the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media, it may impact our brand and reputation. Further, we have an aging store base that requires maintenance and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. We must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates. Failure to maintain our stores and utilize our store space effectively; to provide a compelling online presence; to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs; to provide quick and low-cost delivery alternatives; to differentiate the customer experience for our three primary customer groups; and to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs. Our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, or healthcare benefits. An inability to provide wages and/or benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract employees. In addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly as the economy continues to improve and the labor market tightens. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. A failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data. In managing our business, we also rely heavily on the integrity of, security of and consistent access to this data for information such as sales, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment and order fulfillment. For these information technology systems and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must periodically maintain and update them. Our systems and the third-party systems on which we rely are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; security breaches; cyber-attacks, including the use of ransomware; 8 catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, or hurricanes; acts of war or terrorism; and design or usage errors by our associates, contractors or third-party service providers. Although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, such efforts may not be successful. As a result, we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. Disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. Through our information technology developments, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected retail experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices. We use our websites and our mobile app both as sales channels for our products and also as methods of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales. We have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. Multichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer preferences and new developments. We also continually seek to enhance all of our online properties to provide an attractive user-friendly interface for our customers, as evidenced by our recent redesign of our homedepot.com website. Disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. If our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier and Company information are not successful, we could incur substantial additional costs and reputational damage, and could become subject to further litigation and enforcement actions. Our business, like that of most retailers, involves the receipt, storage and transmission of customers personal information, preferences and payment card information, as well as other confidential information, such as personal information about our associates and our suppliers and confidential Company information. We also work with third-party service providers and vendors that provide technology, systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of this information. Our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third-party service providers or vendors. Hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. We have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss. However, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data. Any future significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or Company data, could result in significant costs, lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in significant costs. We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, PayPal, our private label credit cards, an installment loan program, trade credit, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we 9 fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. As a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Uncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions, political climate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. Our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. Adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets, the economy or the political climate could adversely impact our customers confidence or financial condition, causing them to determine not to purchase home improvement products and services, causing them to delay purchasing decisions, or impacting their ability to pay for products and services. Other factors beyond our control  including unemployment and foreclosure rates; interest rate fluctuations; fuel and other energy costs; labor and healthcare costs; the availability of financing; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; weather; natural disasters; acts of terrorism and other conditions beyond our control  could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. If we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. We buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing, as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by political instability, military conflict, acts of terrorism, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, any disruptions in our suppliers logistics or supply chain networks, and other factors beyond our or our suppliers control. The implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. We have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and information technology systems. These initiatives, such as Project Sync and COM, our new Customer Order Management system, are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high-quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience. The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term and lead to product availability issues. Failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. In addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded information technology systems might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. A disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation. Such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers; weather-related events; natural disasters; trade policy changes or restrictions; tariffs or import-related taxes; third-party strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns; shipping capacity constraints; supply or shipping interruptions or costs; or other factors beyond our control. Any such disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. 10 If we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. As part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. We have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. Our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than national brand products, and represent a growing portion of our business. If we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results. Our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks. As we expand our proprietary product offerings, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. The risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and product recall exposure and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. To effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our vendors products, which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our vendors. Any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to manage effectively our installation services business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits and reputational damage, or the loss of our general contractor licenses. We act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our DIFM customers through professional third-party installers. As such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of work performed by our third-party installers. We have established processes and procedures to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. However, if we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits for violations of regulatory requirements, as well as for property damage or personal injury. In addition, we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could adversely affect our business. We may be unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategy, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation. In fiscal 2015, we completed the acquisition of Interline, which we believe has enhanced our ability to serve our professional customers and increased our share of the MRO market. During fiscal 2016, we continued to develop and implement our strategy with Interline. Our goal is to serve all of our different Pro customer groups through one integrated approach to drive growth and capture market share in the retail, services and MRO markets, and this strategy depends, in part, on our continuing integration of Interline. As with any acquisition, we need to successfully integrate Interlines products, services, associates and systems into our business operations. Integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. Furthermore, even if Interline is successfully integrated, the acquisition may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional liabilities associated with the Interline business and the wholesale market. Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. These laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; healthcare; data protection and cybersecurity; the sale of some of our products; transportation; logistics; international trade; supply chain transparency; taxes; unclaimed property; 11 energy costs; or environmental matters, including with respect to our installation services business, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations. If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profit margins may be impacted. Our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our U.S. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. Our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations and other legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political and economic conditions. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences; potential tariffs and other import-related taxes; greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights; risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery law compliance; and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers. In addition, our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates, which may adversely impact our sales and profit margins. The inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. Prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. We have incurred losses related to the data breach we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 (the \"Data Breach\"); we may incur additional losses or experience future operational impacts on our business, which could have an adverse impact on our operations, financial results and reputation. The Data Breach involved the theft of certain payment card information and customer email addresses through unauthorized access to our systems. Since the Data Breach occurred, we have recorded $198 million of pretax expenses, net of expected insurance recoveries, in connection with the Data Breach, as described in more detail in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\". We are still facing a consolidated shareholder derivative action brought by two purported shareholders and an investigation by a number of State Attorneys General. These matters may adversely affect how we operate our business, divert the attention of management from the operation of the business, have an adverse effect on our reputation, and result in additional costs and fines. We are involved in a number of legal and regulatory proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. In addition to the matters discussed above with respect to the Data Breach, we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts. Additionally, involvement in these lawsuits, investigations and inquiries, and other proceedings may involve significant expense, divert managements attention and resources from other matters, and impact the reputation of the Company. 12 ", "1B": " Item 1B.

At the end of fiscal 2016 , we operated 274 warehouses and distribution centers located in 45 states or provinces, consisting of approximately 54.3 million square feet, of which approximately 1.5 million is owned and approximately 52.8 million is leased. Our executive, corporate staff, divisional staff and financial offices occupy approximately 2.6 million square feet of leased and owned space in Atlanta, Georgia. At the end of fiscal 2016 , including the offices in Atlanta, we occupied an aggregate of approximately 4.5 million square feet, of which approximately 2.7 million is owned and approximately 1.8 million is leased, for store support centers and customer support centers. 14 ", "3": " Item 3. Legal Proceedings. For a description of the litigation and government inquiries related to the Data Breach, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\", which description is incorporated herein by reference. SEC regulations require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental provisions if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more. In January 2017, the Company became aware of an investigation by the EPAs criminal investigation division into the Companys compliance with lead-safe work practices for certain jobs performed through our installation services business. The Company has also previously responded to civil document requests from several EPA regions. The Company is cooperating with the EPA. As previously reported, in November 2013, the Company received subpoenas from the District Attorney of Alameda County, California, working with various District Attorneys and the California Attorney Generals office (collectively, the \"District Attorneys\"), seeking documents and information relating to the Companys disposal of hazardous waste at its California facilities. The District Attorneys are currently seeking monetary penalties and certain changes to our operations with respect to the disposal of hazardous waste in California. The Company is cooperating with the District Attorneys in their investigation.

Executive Summary and Selected Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data Net Sales increased 6.9% to $94.6 billion for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2017 (\"fiscal 2016 \") from $88.5 billion for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 (\"fiscal 2015 \"). Our total comparable store sales increased 5.6% in fiscal 2016 , driven by a 2.8% increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 2.7% increase in our comparable store average ticket. Comparable store sales for our U.S. stores increased 6.2% in fiscal 2016 . For fiscal 2016 , we reported Net Earnings of $8.0 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $6.45 compared to Net Earnings of $7.0 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $5.46 for fiscal 2015 . The results for fiscal 2016 included $37 million of pretax expenses related to the Data Breach that we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to $128 million of pretax net expenses for fiscal 2015 . These charges resulted in decreases of $0.02 and $0.06 to Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Since the Data Breach occurred, we have recorded $198 million of pretax net expenses related to the Data Breach. The Data Breach is discussed further in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The results for fiscal 2015 included a $144 million pretax gain related to the sale of our remaining equity ownership in HD Supply Holdings, Inc. (\"HD Supply\"). This gain contributed $0.07 to Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2015 . In fiscal 2016 , we continued to focus on the following: Customer Experience  Customer experience is anchored on the principles of putting customers first and taking care of our associates, and our commitment to customer service remains strong. We have taken a number of steps to provide our customers with a seamless and frictionless shopping experience in our stores, online, on the job site and in their homes. In fiscal 2016, we rolled out a redesign of our Home Depot website to provide our customers with better search capabilities and a faster checkout experience, and we updated our mobile app. In fiscal 2016 , we continued to invest in our interconnected capabilities to more effectively meet customers demands for increased fulfillment options. We completed the deployment of our new COM platform in all of our U.S. stores in fiscal 2016 . We also completed the roll out of our BODFS program, which was built on the foundation of COM and complements our existing interconnected retail programs. In fiscal 2016 , approximately 45% of our online U.S. orders were picked up in our stores through our BOPIS and BOSS offerings. Sales from our online channels increased 19.3% for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 , and represented 5.9% of our total Net Sales for fiscal 2016 . Also in fiscal 2016, we enabled a dynamic ETA feature for online orders, which provides our customers with a faster and more accurate delivery date based on their location. We believe this will continue to increase conversion rates and improve customer satisfaction. We will continue to blend our physical and digital assets in a seamless and frictionless way to enhance the end-to-end customer experience. Product Authority  Product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value. In fiscal 2016, we continued to introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our do-it-yourself, do-it-for-me and professional customers, while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online. We also continued to leverage our merchandising assortment planning and pricing tools to better understand customer preferences and to refine our online and in-store product assortment in particular stores and geographic areas. Productivity and Efficiency Driven by Capital Allocation  Our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through continuous operational improvement in our stores and supply chain, disciplined capital allocation, and building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In fiscal 2016, we continued to optimize our supply chain through our multi-year program called Project Sync. We rolled out the first phase of Project Sync to all of our U.S. stores, and we continue to onboard new suppliers. This program will allow us to significantly reduce our average lead time from supplier to shelf, reduce transportation expenses and improve inventory turns. As we continue to roll out Project Sync, we plan to create an end-to-end solution that benefits all participants in our supply chain, from our suppliers to our transportation providers, to our RDCs and store associates, and to our customers. We repurchased a total of 53 million shares of our common stock for $7.0 billion through the open market during fiscal 2016 . In addition, in February 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaces the previous authorization, and we announced a 29% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.89 per share. 18 In fiscal 2016 , we opened four new stores in Mexico, for a total store count of 2,278 at the end of fiscal 2016 . As of the end of fiscal 2016 , a total of 301 of our stores, or 13.2% , were located in Canada and Mexico. In August 2015, we completed the acquisition of Interline for $1.7 billion. This acquisition allowed us to establish a platform in the MRO market where we serve primarily institutional customers, such as educational and healthcare institutions, hospitality businesses, and national apartment complexes. We generated $9.8 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2016 . This cash flow, along with $5.0 billion of long-term debt issued in fiscal 2016 and $360 million of short-term borrowings in fiscal 2016 , was used to repay $3.0 billion of 5.40% senior notes that matured on March 1, 2016, fund cash payments of $6.9 billion for share repurchases, pay $3.4 billion of dividends and fund $1.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.9 times at the end of both fiscal 2016 and 2015 . Our return on invested capital (defined as net operating profit after tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt, including current installments, and equity for the most recent twelve-month period) was 31.4% at the end of fiscal 2016 compared to 28.1% at the end of fiscal 2015 . For a reconciliation of net operating profit after tax to Net Earnings, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, and our calculation of return on invested capital, see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below. 19 We believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations.  ##TABLE_START  % of Net Sales  % Increase (Decrease) In Dollar Amounts  Fiscal Year (1)     vs. 2015  vs. 2014 NET SALES 100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 %  6.9 %  6.4 % GROSS PROFIT 34.2  34.2  34.1  6.8  6.6 Operating Expenses:          Selling, General and Administrative 18.1  19.0  19.6  2.0  3.2 Depreciation and Amortization 1.9  1.9  2.0  3.8  3.0 Total Operating Expenses 20.0  20.9  21.5  2.1  3.2 OPERATING INCOME 14.2  13.3  12.6  14.0  12.5 Interest and Other (Income) Expense:          Interest and Investment Income   (0.2 )  (0.4 )  (78.3 )  (50.7 ) Interest Expense 1.0  1.0  1.0  5.8  10.7 Interest and Other, net 1.0  0.9  0.6  24.3  52.7 EARNINGS BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 13.2  12.5  12.0  13.3  10.5 Provision for Income Taxes 4.8  4.5  4.4  13.0  10.5 NET EARNINGS 8.4 %  7.9 %  7.6 %  13.5 %  10.5 % SELECTED SALES DATA (2)          Number of Customer Transactions (in millions) 1,544.0  1,500.8  1,441.6  2.9 %  4.1 % Average Ticket $ 60.35  $ 58.77  $ 57.87  2.7 %  1.6 % Sales per Square Foot $ 390.78  $ 370.55  $ 352.22  5.5 %  5.2 % Comparable Store Sales Increase (%) (3) 5.6 %  5.6 %  5.3 %  N/A  N/A Online Sales (% of Net Sales) (4) 5.9 %  5.3 %  4.5 %  19.3 %  25.4 % ##TABLE_ENDNote: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding.   ##TABLE_START (1) Fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 refer to the fiscal years ended January 29, 2017 , January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 , respectively, and each includes 52 weeks. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Selected Sales Data does not include results for Interline, which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Includes Net Sales at locations open greater than 12 months, including relocated and remodeled stores and online sales, and excluding closed stores.

Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015  Net Sales Net Sales for fiscal 2016  increased  6.9% to $94.6 billion from $88.5 billion for fiscal 2015 . The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2016 primarily reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth, as well as sales from Interline, which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The increase in Net Sales was partially offset by pressure from the strengthening U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted total sales growth by $549 million in fiscal 2016. Total comparable store sales increased 5.6% for fiscal 2016 , which reflects a number of factors, including the execution of our strategy, continued strength across our business, and an improved U.S. home improvement market. All of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2016 . Comparable store sales for our Appliances, Tools, Lumber, Lighting, Dcor, Building Materials and Indoor Garden product categories were above the Company average for fiscal 2016 . Further, our comparable store customer transactions increased 2.8% for fiscal 2016 and comparable store average ticket increased 2.7% for fiscal 2016 , due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases such as appliances, flooring and roofing, offset in part by the strength of the U.S. dollar. Gross Profit Gross Profit increased  6.8% to $32.3 billion for fiscal 2016 from $30.3 billion for fiscal 2015 . Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.2% for both fiscal 2016 and 2015 . Gross profit margin for fiscal 2016 reflects the impact of product mix changes, offset by benefits from our supply chain driven by increased productivity and benefits from reaching higher levels of co-op allowances and rebates in certain category classes. Operating Expenses Selling, General and Administrative expenses (\"SGA\") increased  2.0% to $17.1 billion for fiscal 2016 from $16.8 billion for fiscal 2015 . SGA for fiscal 2016 included $37 million of pretax expenses related to the Data Breach compared to $128 million of pretax net expenses for fiscal 2015 . As a percent of Net Sales, SGA was 18.1% for fiscal 2016 compared to 19.0% for fiscal 2015 . The decrease in SGA as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2016 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment and strong expense controls. Depreciation and Amortization increased  3.8% to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2016 from $1.7 billion for fiscal 2015 . Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 1.9% for both fiscal 2016 and 2015 . Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2016 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment. Operating Income Operating Income increased  14.0% to $13.4 billion for fiscal 2016 from $11.8 billion for fiscal 2015 . Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 14.2% for fiscal 2016 compared to 13.3% for fiscal 2015 . Interest and Other, net In fiscal 2016 , we recognized $936 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $753 million for fiscal 2015 . Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2015 included a $144 million pretax gain related to the sale of our remaining equity ownership in HD Supply. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 1.0% for fiscal 2016 compared to 0.9% for fiscal 2015 due primarily to the anniversary of the pretax gain related to the sale of our remaining equity ownership in HD Supply in fiscal 2015 and higher long-term debt balances in fiscal 2016. Provision for Income Taxes Our combined effective income tax rate was 36.3% for fiscal 2016 and 36.4% for fiscal 2015 . Diluted Earnings per Share Diluted Earnings per Share were $6.45 for fiscal 2016 compared to $5.46 for fiscal 2015 . Expenses related to the Data Breach resulted in decreases of $0.02 and $0.06 to Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. The gain on the 21 sale of our remaining equity ownership in HD Supply contributed a benefit of $0.07 to Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 Net Sales Net Sales for fiscal 2015 increased 6.4% to $88.5 billion from $83.2 billion for fiscal 2014. The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2015 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth, partially offset by pressure from the strengthening U.S. dollar. Total comparable store sales increased 5.6% for fiscal 2015. The positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2015 reflect a number of factors, including the execution of our key initiatives, an improved U.S. home improvement market and broad-based growth across our stores. All of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2015. Comparable store sales for our Tools, Appliances, Plumbing, Dcor, Lighting, Indoor Garden, Building Materials and Hardware product categories were above the Company average for fiscal 2015. Further, our comparable store customer transactions increased 4.0% for fiscal 2015 and comparable store average ticket increased 1.6% for fiscal 2015, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases such as appliances, roofing and several installation service categories, offset in part by the strength of the U.S. dollar. Gross Profit Gross Profit increased 6.6% to $30.3 billion for fiscal 2015 from $28.4 billion for fiscal 2014. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.2% for fiscal 2015 compared to 34.1% for fiscal 2014, an increase of 6 basis points. The increase in gross profit margin for fiscal 2015 reflects benefits from our supply chain driven by lower fuel costs and increased productivity, partially offset by a change in the mix of products sold and the impact of Interline, which has a lower gross profit margin. Operating Expenses SGA increased 3.2% to $16.8 billion for fiscal 2015 from $16.3 billion for fiscal 2014. SGA for fiscal 2015 included $128 million of pretax net expenses related to the Data Breach compared to $33 million of pretax net expenses for fiscal 2014. As a percent of Net Sales, SGA was 19.0% for fiscal 2015 compared to 19.6% for fiscal 2014. The decrease in SGA as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2015 reflects strong expense controls and expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment, partially offset by expenses related to the Data Breach. Depreciation and Amortization increased 3.0% to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2015 from $1.6 billion for fiscal 2014. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 1.9% for fiscal 2015 compared to 2.0% for fiscal 2014. The decrease in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2015 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment. Operating Income Operating Income increased 12.5% to $11.8 billion for fiscal 2015 from $10.5 billion for fiscal 2014. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 13.3% for fiscal 2015 compared to 12.6% for fiscal 2014. Interest and Other, net In fiscal 2015, we recognized $753 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $493 million for fiscal 2014. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.9% for fiscal 2015 compared to 0.6% for fiscal 2014. These results include a $144 million pretax gain in fiscal 2015 related to the sale of our remaining equity ownership in HD Supply compared to a pretax gain of $323 million in fiscal 2014 related to the sales of portions of our equity ownership in HD Supply. Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2015 also reflects additional interest expense associated with $4.0 billion of long-term debt issued in fiscal 2015. Provision for Income Taxes Our combined effective income tax rate was 36.4% for both fiscal 2015 and 2014. 22 Diluted Earnings per Share Diluted Earnings per Share were $5.46 for fiscal 2015 compared to $4.71 for fiscal 2014. Expenses related to the Data Breach had a negative impact of $0.06 to Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2015 compared to a negative impact of $0.02 for fiscal 2014. The gains on the sales of our equity ownership in HD Supply contributed a benefit of $0.07 to Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2015 compared to a benefit of $0.15 for fiscal 2014. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-GAAP financial measures. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies. Return on Invested Capital We believe return on invested capital (\"ROIC\") is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. We define ROIC as net operating profit after tax (\"NOPAT\"), a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt, including current installments, and equity for the most recent twelve-month period. The following table provides our ROIC calculation and reconciles NOPAT to Net Earnings, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, for the twelve months ended January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 (amounts in millions):  ##TABLE_START   For the Twelve Months Ended   January 29, 2017  January 31, 2016 Net Earnings  $ 7,957  $ 7,009 Add:     Interest and Other, net   Provision for Income Taxes  4,534  4,012 Operating Income  13,427  11,774 Subtract:     Income Tax Adjustment (1)  4,874  4,286 Net Operating Profit After Tax  $ 8,553  $ 7,488      Average Debt and Equity (2)  $ 27,203  $ 26,663      Return on Invested Capital (NOPAT / Average Debt and Equity)  31.4 %  28.1 % ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1) Income Tax Adjustment is defined as Operating Income multiplied by the Companys effective tax rate. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Average Debt and Equity is defined as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt, including current installments, and equity for the most recent twelve-month period. ##TABLE_ENDLiquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. For fiscal 2016 , Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $9.8 billion compared to $9.4 billion for fiscal 2015 . This increase was primarily due to a $948 million increase in Net Earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense leverage partially offset by a $442 million decrease in cash flows from Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses related to the timing of purchases and payments, and a $223 million increase in Merchandise Inventories as a result of increased inventory purchases in support of increased sales. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities for fiscal 2016 was $1.6 billion compared to $3.0 billion for fiscal 2015 . This change was primarily due to $1.7 billion in Payments for Businesses Acquired, net, in fiscal 2015 related to the acquisition of Interline. 23 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities for fiscal 2016 was $7.9 billion compared to $5.8 billion for fiscal 2015 . This change was primarily due to $2.0 billion less in net incremental long-term debt issued in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, we repurchased 53 million shares of our common stock for $7.0 billion through the open market. Since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in 2002 and through fiscal 2016, we have repurchased 1.3 billion shares of our common stock for a total of $67.1 billion. In February 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaces the previous authorization. In September 2016, we issued $1.0 billion of 2.125% senior notes due September 15, 2026 (the \"September 2026 notes\") at a discount of $11 million and $1.0 billion of 3.50% senior notes due September 15, 2056 (the \"2056 notes\") at a discount of $19 million (together, the \"September 2016 issuance\"). Interest on the September 2026 notes and the 2056 notes is due semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2017. The net proceeds of the September 2016 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock. In February 2016, we issued $1.35 billion of 2.00% senior notes due April 1, 2021 (the \"2021 notes\") at a discount of $5 million, $1.3 billion of 3.00% senior notes due April 1, 2026 (the \"April 2026 notes\") at a discount of $8 million, and $350 million of 4.25% senior notes due April 1, 2046 (the \"2046 notes\") at a premium of $2 million (together, the \"February 2016 issuance\"). The 2046 notes form a single series with our $1.25 billion of 4.25% senior notes due April 1, 2046 that were issued in May 2015, and have the same terms. The aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes due April 1, 2046 is $1.6 billion. Interest on the 2021 notes and the April 2026 notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2016. Interest on the 2046 notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning April 1, 2016, with interest accruing from October 1, 2015. The net proceeds of the February 2016 issuance were used to repay our 5.40% senior notes that matured on March 1, 2016 (the \"2016 notes\"). As a result, the 2016 notes were classified as Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2016. In fiscal 2015, we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of $1.0 billion, accounted for as cash flow hedges, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the February 2016 issuance. In connection with the February 2016 issuance, we paid $89 million to settle these forward starting interest rate swap agreements. This amount, net of income taxes, is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and is being amortized to Interest Expense over the term of the April 2026 notes. In September 2015, we issued $500 million of floating rate senior notes due September 15, 2017 (the \"2017 notes\") and $1.0 billion of 3.35% senior notes due September 15, 2025 (the \"2025 notes\") at a discount of $1 million (together, the \"September 2015 issuance\"). The 2017 notes bear interest at a variable rate determined quarterly equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 37 basis points. Interest on the 2017 notes is due quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2015. Interest on the 2025 notes is due semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2016. The net proceeds of the September 2015 issuance were used to fund the acquisition of Interline. In May 2015, we issued $1.25 billion of 2.625% senior notes due June 1, 2022 (the \"2022 notes\") at a discount of $5 million and $1.25 billion of 4.25% senior notes due April 1, 2046 (the \"existing 2046 notes\") at a discount of $3 million (together, the \"May 2015 issuance\"). Interest on the 2022 notes is due semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 2015. Interest on the existing 2046 notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2015. The net proceeds of the May 2015 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock. In November 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on September 10, 2018 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on our 2.25% senior notes due September 10, 2018 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 88 basis points. At January 29, 2017 , the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $3 million , which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Also in November 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on September 15, 2020 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on our 3.95% senior notes due September 15, 2020 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 183 basis points. At January 29, 2017 , the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $10 million , which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 24 We have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . All of our short-term borrowings in fiscal 2016 and 2015 were under these commercial paper programs. In connection with these programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . The credit facility expires in December 2019 and contains various restrictive covenants. At January 29, 2017 , we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. At January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 , there were $710 million and $350 million , respectively, of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our commercial paper programs and related credit facility. We use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers and store support centers. The net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-Term Debt and Current Installments of Long-Term Debt. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 29, 2017 , we had $2.5 billion in Cash and Cash Equivalents. We believe that our current cash position, access to the long-term debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of January 29, 2017 (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual Obligations Total   2018-2019  2020-2021  Thereafter Total Debt (1) $ 23,045  $ 1,210  $ 2,150  $ 2,850  $ 16,835 Interest Payments on Debt (2) 14,803   1,631  1,519  10,818 Capital Lease Obligations (3) 1,636     Operating Leases 7,453   1,572  1,247  3,727 Purchase Obligations (4) 1,373  1,139    Unrecognized Tax Benefits (5)        Loss Contingencies (6)          Total $ 48,485  $ 4,396  $ 5,783  $ 5,905  $ 32,401 ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1) Excludes present value of capital lease obligations, fair value of interest rate swaps, unamortized debt discounts, premiums and debt issuance costs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Interest payments are at current interest rates including the impact of active interest rate swaps. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Includes $ 758 million of imputed interest. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, software acquisitions and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) Excludes $ 484 million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6) Excludes estimated loss contingencies related to the Data Breach due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. ##TABLE_END 25 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. Interest rate swap agreements are used, at times, to manage our fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. At January 29, 2017 , after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, approximately 93% of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate debt and 7% was floating-rate debt. A 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. As of January 29, 2017 we had, net of discounts, $ 22.0 billion of senior notes outstanding. The aggregate market value of these publicly traded senior notes as of January 29, 2017 was $ 23.6 billion . We are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. Revenues from these foreign operations accounted for approximately $ 8.0 billion and $ 8.0 billion of our revenue for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. Impact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices We have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates. Revenues We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. We have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. However, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely impacted. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. We also record Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. Merchandise Inventories Our Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, with approximately 70% valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method. Retailers like us, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, Merchandise Inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. We evaluate our inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the end of fiscal 2016 or 2015 . Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, \"swell\") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. We estimate shrink as a percent of Net Sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. The estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent 26 shrink results and current trends in the business. Actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2016 , 2015 or 2014 . Self-Insurance We have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability (including product liability), workers compensation, employee group medical and automobile claims for which we are self-insured. Our self-insured retention or deductible, as applicable, for each claim involving general liability, workers compensation and automobile liability is limited to $25 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively. We do not have any stop loss limits for self-insured employee group medical claims. Our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. The liabilities are reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2016 , 2015 or 2014 . We maintain network security and privacy liability insurance coverage to limit our exposure to losses such as those that may be caused by a significant compromise or breach of our data security. This coverage is discussed further in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. We believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors. Volume rebates and certain advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in SGA. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, managements decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, we also recognize in SGA the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of long-lived assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition and inflation. A 10% decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations. Our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations. A 10% decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10% increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations. We recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2016 , 2015 or 2014 . 27 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. Each year we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments, with a quantitative assessment completed at least once every three years. We completed a quantitative assessment in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016 , we completed our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for our U.S., Canada and Mexico reporting units. The fair values of these reporting units were estimated using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows, and the fair value exceeded the carrying value for each respective reporting unit. There were no impairment charges related to goodwill for fiscal 2016 , 2015 or 2014 . We amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 12 years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. There were no impairment charges related to our other intangible assets for fiscal 2016 , 2015 or 2014 .

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their accompanying report is based upon an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting solely of independent directors, meets five times a year with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and representatives of management to discuss auditing and financial reporting matters. In addition, a telephonic meeting is held prior to each quarterly earnings release. The Audit Committee retains the independent registered public accounting firm and regularly reviews the internal accounting controls, the activities of the independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors and the financial condition of the Company. Both the Companys independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2017 based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 29, 2017 in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2017 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included on page 30 in this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START /s/ C RAIG A.

The Home Depot, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, The Home Depot, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 29, 2017 , and our report dated March 23, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/ KPMG LLP Atlanta, Georgia March 23, 2017  30 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders The Home Depot, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 29, 2017 . These Consolidated Financial Statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Consolidated Financial Statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 29, 2017 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ##TABLE_END Business, Consolidation and Presentation The Home Depot, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (the \"Company\"), is a home improvement retailer that sells a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products and lawn and garden products and provides a number of services. The Home Depot stores, which are full-service, warehouse-style stores averaging approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area, stock approximately 30,000 to 40,000 different kinds of products that are sold to do-it-yourself customers, do-it-for-me customers and professional customers. The Company also offers a significantly broader product assortment through its websites. At the end of fiscal 2016 , the Company was operating 2,278 The Home Depot stores, which included 1,977 stores in the United States, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam (\"U.S.\"), 182 stores in Canada and 119 stores in Mexico. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31. Fiscal years ended January 29, 2017 (\"fiscal 2016 \"), January 31, 2016 (\"fiscal 2015 \") and February 1, 2015 (\"fiscal 2014 \") include 52 weeks. Use of Estimates Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses in preparing these financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"). Actual results could differ from these estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Receivables, Short-Term Debt and Accounts Payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments. The fair value of the Companys Long-Term Debt is discussed in Note 11. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Companys cash equivalents are carried at fair market value and consist primarily of money market funds. Accounts Receivable The Company has agreements with third-party service providers who directly extend credit to customers, manage the Companys private label credit card program (\"PLCC program\") and own the related receivables. The Company evaluated the third-party entities holding the receivables under the program and concluded that they should not be consolidated by the Company. The agreement with the primary third-party service provider for the Companys PLCC program expires in 2028 , with the Company having the option, but no obligation, to purchase the receivables at the end of the agreement. The deferred interest charges incurred by the Company for its deferred financing programs offered to its customers are included in Cost of Sales. The interchange fees charged to the Company for the customers use of the cards and any profit sharing with the third-party service providers are included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses (\"SGA\"). The sum of these three components is referred to by the Company as \"the cost of credit\" of the PLCC program. In addition, certain subsidiaries of the Company, including Interline Brands, Inc. (\"Interline\"), extend credit directly to customers in the ordinary course of business. The receivables due from customers were $ 216 million and $ 253 million as of January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 , respectively. The Companys valuation reserve related to accounts receivable was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of the end of fiscal 2016 or 2015 . Merchandise Inventories The majority of the Companys Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, as determined by the retail inventory method. As the inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, the inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Certain subsidiaries, including retail operations in Canada and Mexico, distribution centers and Interline, record Merchandise Inventories at the lower of cost or 37 market, as determined by a cost method. These Merchandise Inventories represent approximately 30% of the total Merchandise Inventories balance. The Company evaluates the inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of the end of fiscal 2016 or 2015 . Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in stores, the Company accrues for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, \"swell\") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. The Company provides for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as for those deferred due to timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Non-U.S. subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, are not eligible to be included in the Companys consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Separate provisions for income taxes have been determined for these entities. The Company intends to reinvest substantially all of the unremitted earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries and postpone their remittance indefinitely. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes on these earnings was recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Depreciation and Amortization The Companys Buildings, Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold Improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the original term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. The Companys Property and Equipment is depreciated using the following estimated useful lives:  ##TABLE_START  Life Buildings 5  45 years Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment 2  20 years Leasehold Improvements 5  45 years ##TABLE_ENDCapitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to six years. Certain development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred. Revenues The Company recognizes revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. The liability for sales returns is estimated based on historical return levels. When the Company receives payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. The Company also records Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognizes 38 this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. Gift card breakage income is recognized based upon historical redemption patterns and represents the balance of gift cards for which the Company believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote. During fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the Company recognized $ 34 million , $ 27 million and $ 32 million , respectively, of gift card breakage income. This income is included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a reduction in SGA. Services Revenue Net Sales include services revenue generated through a variety of installation, home maintenance and professional service programs. In these programs, the customer selects and purchases material for a project, and the Company provides or arranges professional installation. These programs are offered through the Companys stores and in-home sales programs. Under certain programs, when the Company provides or arranges the installation of a project and the subcontractor provides material as part of the installation, both the material and labor are included in services revenue. The Company recognizes this revenue when the service for the customer is complete. All payments received prior to the completion of services are recorded in Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Services revenue was $ 4.0 billion , $ 4.0 billion and $ 3.8 billion for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Self-Insurance The Company is self-insured for certain losses related to general liability (including product liability), workers compensation, employee group medical and automobile claims. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date is not discounted and is recognized as a liability. The expected ultimate cost of claims is estimated based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. The Company maintains network security and privacy liability insurance coverage to limit the Companys exposure to losses such as those that may be caused by a significant compromise or breach of the Companys data security. This coverage is discussed further in Note 13. Prepaid Advertising Television and radio advertising production costs, along with media placement costs, are expensed when the advertisement first appears. Amounts included in Other Current Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to prepayments of production costs for print and broadcast advertising as well as sponsorship promotions were not material at the end of fiscal 2016 and 2015 . Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and certain advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense. In fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , gross advertising expense was $ 955 million , $ 868 million and $ 884 million , respectively, and is included in SGA. Specific, incremental and identifiable advertising co-op allowances were $ 166 million , $ 129 million and $ 125 million for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and are recorded as an offset to advertising expense in SGA. Cost of Sales Cost of Sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed, the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to the Companys stores, locations or customers, shipping and handling costs from the Companys stores, locations or distribution centers to customers, the operating cost of the Companys sourcing and distribution network, online fulfillment center costs and the cost of deferred interest programs offered through the Companys private label credit card programs. 39 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates its long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, managements decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SGA in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, the Company also recognizes in SGA the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. The Company recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2016 , 2015 or 2014 . Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. The Company does not amortize goodwill but does assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. Each year the Company may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments, with a quantitative assessment completed at least once every three years. The Company completed a quantitative assessment in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016 , the Company completed its annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for its U.S., Canada and Mexico reporting units. The fair values of these reporting units were estimated using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows, and the fair value exceeded the carrying value for each respective reporting unit. There were no impairment charges related to goodwill for fiscal 2016 , 2015 or 2014 . The Company amortizes the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 12 years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. There were no impairment charges related to other intangible assets for fiscal 2016 , 2015 or 2014 . Stock-Based Compensation The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $ 20.26 , $ 18.54 and $ 14.13 , respectively. The fair value of these options was determined at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  January 29, 2017  January 31, 2016  February 1, 2015 Risk-free interest rate 1.4 %  1.4 %  1.7 % Assumed volatility 20.7 %  20.8 %  22.7 % Assumed dividend yield 2.1 %  2.0 %  2.3 % Assumed lives of options 5 years  5 years  5 years ##TABLE_ENDDerivatives The Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate exposure on long-term debt and its exposure on foreign currency fluctuations. The Company accounts for its derivative financial instruments in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Subtopic 815-10, \"Derivatives and Hedging\". The fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments is discussed in Note 11. 40 Comprehensive Income Comprehensive Income includes Net Earnings adjusted for certain gains and losses that are excluded from Net Earnings under U.S. GAAP. Adjustments to Net Earnings and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss consist primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses are generally translated using average exchange rates for the period, and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the day of the transaction. Segment Information The Company operates within a single reportable segment primarily within North America. Net Sales inside the U.S. were $86.6 billion , $80.5 billion and $74.7 billion for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Net Sales outside the U.S. were $ 8.0 billion , $ 8.0 billion and $ 8.5 billion for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Long-lived assets, which consist of net property and equipment, inside the U.S. totaled $19.5 billion and $19.9 billion as of January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 , respectively. Long-lived assets outside the U.S. totaled $ 2.4 billion and $ 2.3 billion as of January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 , respectively. The following table presents the Net Sales of each major product category (and related services) for each of the last three fiscal years (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START Product Category Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2017  January 31, 2016  February 1, 2015  Net Sales  % of Net Sales  Net Sales  % of Net Sales  Net Sales  % of Net Sales Indoor Garden $ 9,204  9.7 %  $ 8,227  9.3 %  $ 7,486  9.0 % Paint 7,666  8.1  7,497  8.5  7,342  8.8 Appliances 7,362  7.8  6,539  7.4  5,718  6.9 Kitchen and Bath 7,184  7.6  6,909  7.8  6,639  8.0 Plumbing 6,985  7.4  6,364  7.2  5,755  6.9 Lumber 6,828  7.2  6,284  7.1  6,054  7.3 Outdoor Garden 6,789  7.2  6,505  7.3  6,319  7.6 Building Materials 6,774  7.2  6,416  7.2  6,068  7.3 Tools 6,668  7.0  6,060  6.8  5,388  6.5 Flooring 6,477  6.8  6,215  7.0  6,011  7.2 Electrical 6,090  6.4  5,837  6.6  5,656  6.8 Hardware 5,629  6.0  5,296  6.0  4,975  6.0 Millwork 5,139  5.4  4,937  5.6  4,707  5.7 Dcor 2,906  3.1  2,730  3.1  2,554  3.1 Lighting 2,894  3.1  2,703  3.1  2,504  3.0 Total $ 94,595  100.0 %  $ 88,519  100.0 %  $ 83,176  100.0 % ##TABLE_END  Note: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2017-04, \"Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\", which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment. The amendments in ASU No. 2017-04 require that goodwill impairment will be measured using the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit and the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The amendments in ASU No. 2017-04 should be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in annual reporting periods beginning after 41 December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2017-04 will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory\", which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intercompany transfer of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs. An entity will continue to recognize the income tax consequences of an intercompany transfer of inventory when the inventory is sold to a third party. ASU No. 2016-16 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, using a modified retrospective approach, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-16 will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, \"Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\", which makes several modifications to the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the requirement to recognize the income tax effects of awards that vest or settle as income tax expense. The amendments in ASU No. 2016-09 also clarify the presentation of certain components of share-based awards in the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company plans to adopt ASU No. 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and does not believe it will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842)\", which requires an entity that is a lessee to recognize the assets and liabilities arising from leases on the balance sheet. The amendments in ASU No. 2016-02 also require disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, using a modified retrospective approach, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating and planning for the adoption and implementation of ASU No. 2016-02. The Company believes that ASU No. 2016-02 will have a material impact on its financial position, as a result of the requirement to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. The impact to the Companys results of operations is being evaluated, and the Company does not believe there will be a material impact to its cash flows upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-02. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\", which requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, ASU No. 2014-09 requires disclosures of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes most existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition principles, and it permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures, as well as the expected method of adoption. Based on the Companys preliminary assessment, the Company has determined that the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 could impact the timing of revenue recognition through its services, gift card and various incentive programs. ASU No. 2014-09 will impact the Companys method of recognizing gift card breakage income, which is currently recognized based upon historical redemption patterns. ASU No. 2014-09 requires gift card breakage income to be recognized in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer when the Company expects to be entitled to breakage. The Company is also evaluating the principal versus agent considerations as it relates to certain arrangements with third parties that could impact the presentation of gross or net revenue reporting. Other areas which could be impacted may be identified as the Company continues its evaluation of ASU No. 2014-09. The Company plans to adopt ASU No. 2014-09 on January 29, 2018 and is evaluating the available transition methods. Reclassifications Certain amounts in prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform with the presentation adopted in the current fiscal year. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. 42 ##TABLE_START 2. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ##TABLE_END On February 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03, \"InterestImputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\". Under ASU No. 2015-03, debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-03 has been applied retrospectively, and accordingly, the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2016 has been reclassified to reflect this adoption. The impact of this reclassification was a decrease of $99 million to Other Assets, and a corresponding decrease to Long-Term Debt, excluding current installments, as of January 31, 2016. Also on February 1, 2016, the Company early adopted ASU No. 2015-17, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\". Under ASU No. 2015-17, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 has been applied retrospectively and accordingly, the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2016 has been reclassified to reflect this adoption. The impact of this reclassification was a decrease of $509 million to Other Current Assets, an increase of $32 million to Other Assets, a decrease of $2 million to Other Accrued Expenses and a $475 million decrease to Deferred Income Taxes as of January 31, 2016. All future deferred tax assets and liabilities will be presented as noncurrent. ##TABLE_START 3. PROPERTY AND LEASES ##TABLE_END Property and Equipment as of January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 consisted of the following (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  January 29, 2017  January 31, 2016 Property and Equipment, at cost:    Land $ 8,207  $ 8,149 Buildings 17,772  17,667 Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment 11,020  10,279 Leasehold Improvements 1,519  1,481 Construction in Progress  Capital Leases 1,169  1,020  40,426  39,266 Less Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization 18,512  17,075 Net Property and Equipment $ 21,914  $ 22,191 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company leases certain retail locations, office space, warehouse and distribution space, equipment and vehicles. While most of the leases are operating leases, certain locations and equipment are leased under capital leases. As leases expire, it can be expected that in the normal course of business certain leases will be renewed or replaced. Certain lease agreements include escalating rents over the lease terms. The Company expenses rent on a straight-line basis over the lease term, which commences on the date the Company has the right to control the property. The cumulative expense recognized on a straight-line basis in excess of the cumulative payments is included in Other Accrued Expenses and Other Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total rent expense, net of minor sublease income, for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $ 984 million , $ 922 million and $ 918 million , respectively. Certain store leases also provide for contingent rent payments based on percentages of sales in excess of specified minimums. Contingent rent expense for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was approximately $ 9 million , $ 7 million and $ 7 million , respectively. Real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and operating expenses applicable to the leased property are obligations of the Company under the lease agreements. 43 The approximate future minimum lease payments under capital and all other leases at January 29, 2017 were as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Capital Leases Operating Leases $ $ 2018 826 124 2020 661 118 Thereafter through 2097 3,727 1,636 $ 7,453 Less imputed interest Net present value of capital lease obligations Less current installments Long-term capital lease obligations, excluding current installments $ ##TABLE_ENDShort-term and long-term obligations for capital leases are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in Current Installments of Long-Term Debt and Long-Term Debt, respectively. The assets under capital leases recorded in Property and Equipment, net of amortization, totaled $ 730 million and $ 629 million at January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 , respectively. ##TABLE_START 4. DEBT ##TABLE_END The Company has commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . All of the Companys short-term borrowings in fiscal 2016 and 2015 were under these commercial paper programs. In connection with these programs, the Company has a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion .

Interest on the September 2026 notes and the 2056 notes is due semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2017. The $30 million discount associated with the September 2016 issuance is being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method. Issuance costs of $16 million associated with the September 2016 issuance were recorded as a direct deduction to the senior notes and are being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method. The net proceeds of the September 2016 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of the Companys common stock. In February 2016, the Company issued $1.35 billion of 2.00% senior notes due April 1, 2021 (the \"2021 notes\") at a discount of $5 million , $1.3 billion of 3.00% senior notes due April 1, 2026 (the \"April 2026 notes\") at a discount of $8 million , and $350 million of 4.25% senior notes due April 1, 2046 (the \"2046 notes\") at a premium of $2 million (together, the \"February 2016 issuance\"). The 2046 notes form a single series with the Companys $1.25 billion of 4.25% senior notes due April 1, 2046 that were issued in May 2015, and have the same terms. The aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Companys senior notes due April 1, 2046 is $1.6 billion . Interest on the 2021 notes and the April 2026 notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2016. Interest on the 2046 notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning April 1, 2016, with interest accruing from October 1, 2015. The $13 million discount associated with the 2021 and the April 2026 notes and the $2 million premium associated with the 2046 notes are being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method. Issuance costs of $17 million associated with the February 2016 issuance were recorded as a direct deduction to the senior notes and are being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method. The net proceeds of the February 2016 issuance were used to repay the Companys 5.40% senior notes due March 1, 2016 (the \"2016 notes\"). As a result, the 2016 notes were classified as Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2016. In September 2015, the Company issued $500 million of floating rate senior notes due September 15, 2017 (the \"2017 notes\") and $1.0 billion of 3.35% senior notes due September 15, 2025 (the \"2025 notes\") at a discount of $1 million (together, the \"September 2015 issuance\"). The 2017 notes bear interest at a variable rate determined quarterly equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 37 basis points. Interest on the 2017 notes is due quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2015. Interest on the 2025 notes is due semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2016. The $1 million discount associated with the 2025 notes is being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method. Issuance costs of $7 million associated with the September 2015 issuance were recorded as a direct deduction to the senior notes and are being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method. The net proceeds of the September 2015 issuance were used to fund the Companys acquisition of Interline. In May 2015, the Company issued $1.25 billion of 2.625% senior notes due June 1, 2022 (the \"2022 notes\") at a discount of $5 million and $1.25 billion of 4.25% senior notes due April 1, 2046 (the \"existing 2046 notes\") at a discount of $3 million (together, the \"May 2015 issuance\"). Interest on the 2022 notes is due semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 2015. Interest on the existing 2046 notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2015. The $8 million discount associated with the May 2015 issuance is being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method. Issuance costs of $19 million associated with the May 2015 issuance were recorded as a direct deduction to the senior notes and are being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method. The net proceeds of the May 2015 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of the Companys common stock. All of the Companys senior notes, other than the 2017 notes, may be redeemed by the Company at any time, in whole or in part, at the redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the Par Call Date, as defined in the respective notes. Additionally, if a Change in Control Triggering Event occurs, as defined in the notes, holders of all notes have the right to require the Company to redeem those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The Company is generally not limited under the indentures governing the notes in its ability to incur additional indebtedness or required to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. Further, while the indentures governing the notes contain various restrictive covenants, none are expected to impact the Companys liquidity or capital resources. 46 In fiscal 2015, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of $1.0 billion , accounted for as cash flow hedges, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the February 2016 issuance. In connection with the February 2016 issuance, the Company paid $89 million to settle these forward starting interest rate swap agreements. This amount, net of income taxes, is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and is being amortized to Interest Expense over the term of the April 2026 notes. At January 29, 2017 , the Company had outstanding cross currency swap agreements with a combined notional amount of $626 million , accounted for as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency fluctuations on certain intercompany debt. At January 29, 2017 , the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of $258 million , which is the estimated amount the Company would have received to settle the agreements and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. In November 2013, the Company entered into an interest rate swap that expires on September 10, 2018 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on the Companys 2.25% senior notes due September 10, 2018 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 88 basis points. At January 29, 2017 , the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $3 million , which is the estimated amount the Company would have received to settle the agreement and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Also in November 2013, the Company entered into an interest rate swap that expires on September 15, 2020 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on the Companys 3.95% senior notes due September 15, 2020 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 183 basis points. At January 29, 2017 , the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $10 million , which is the estimated amount the Company would have received to settle the agreement and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings is net of interest capitalized of $1 million , $2 million and $2 million in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Maturities of Long-Term Debt are $542 million for fiscal 2017 , $1.2 billion for fiscal 2018 , $1.0 billion for fiscal 2019 , $573 million for fiscal 2020 , $2.4 billion for fiscal 2021 and $17.2 billion thereafter. ##TABLE_START 5. ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ##TABLE_END The Company enters into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (\"ASR\") agreement from time to time with a third-party financial institution to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. Under the ASR agreement, the Company pays a specified amount to the financial institution and receives an initial delivery of shares. This initial delivery of shares represents the minimum number of shares that the Company may receive under the agreement. Upon settlement of the ASR agreement, the financial institution delivers additional shares, with the final number of shares delivered determined with reference to the volume weighted average price per share of the Companys common stock over the term of the agreement, less a negotiated discount. The transactions are accounted for as equity transactions and are included in Treasury Stock when the shares are received, at which time there is an immediate reduction in the weighted average common shares calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share. The following table provides the terms for each of the ASR agreements the Company entered into during the last three fiscal years.

At January 29, 2017 , the Company had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, expiring at various dates beginning in 2017 to 2036 . Management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits related to the federal and state net operating losses will be realized. However, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to utilize certain foreign net operating losses. Therefore, a valuation allowance has been provided to reduce the deferred tax asset related to foreign net operating losses to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Total valuation allowances related to foreign net operating losses at January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 were $3 million and $3 million , respectively. The Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on approximately $4.2 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries because of its intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable; however, unrecognized foreign income tax credits would be available to reduce a portion of this liability. The Companys income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. For fiscal years 2005 through 2009 , a transfer pricing issue remains open pending negotiations between the U.S. and Mexican tax authorities. The Companys U.S. federal tax returns for fiscal years 2010 through 2012 are currently under examination by the IRS. During fiscal 2016, the IRS issued a proposed adjustment relating to the Companys transfer pricing between its entities in the U.S. 49 and China for fiscal years 2010 through 2012 . The Company intends to defend its position using all available remedies including bi-lateral relief. There are also ongoing U.S. state and local and other foreign audits covering fiscal years 2005 through 2014 . The Company does not expect the results from any ongoing income tax audit to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Over the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the resolution of federal and state tax examinations could reduce the Companys unrecognized tax benefits by $175 million . Final settlement of these audit issues may result in payments that are more or less than this amount, but the Company does not anticipate the resolution of these matters will result in a material change to its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Reconciliations of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  January 29, 2017  January 31, 2016  February 1, 2015 Unrecognized tax benefits balance at beginning of fiscal year $  $  $ Additions based on tax positions related to the current year   Additions for tax positions of prior years   Reductions for tax positions of prior years (161 )  (350 )  (212 ) Reductions due to settlements (16 )  (14 )  (7 ) Reductions due to lapse of statute of limitations (14 )  (7 )  (19 ) Unrecognized tax benefits balance at end of fiscal year $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the annual effective income tax rate on Net Earnings was $382 million , $382 million and $318 million as of January 29, 2017 , January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 , respectively. Net adjustments to accruals for interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions resulted in expenses of $20 million , $5 million and $2 million in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Total accrued interest and penalties as of January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 were $109 million and $89 million , respectively. Interest and penalties are included in Interest Expense and SGA, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 50 ##TABLE_START 7. EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS ##TABLE_END The Home Depot, Inc. Amended and Restated 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (\"2005 Plan\") and The Home Depot, Inc. 1997 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (\"1997 Plan\" and collectively with the 2005 Plan, the \"Plans\") provide that incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares, performance units and deferred shares may be issued to selected associates, officers and directors of the Company. Under the 2005 Plan, the maximum number of shares of the Companys common stock authorized for issuance is 255 million shares, with any award other than a stock option or stock appreciation right reducing the number of shares available for issuance by 2.11 shares. As of January 29, 2017 , there were 133 million shares available for future grants under the 2005 Plan. No additional equity awards could be issued from the 1997 Plan after the adoption of the 2005 Plan on May 26, 2005. Under the terms of the Plans, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options must have an exercise price at or above the fair market value of the Companys stock on the date of the grant. Typically, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options vest at the rate of 25% per year commencing on the first or second anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth anniversary date of the grant. Additionally, certain stock options may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The Company recognized $ 26 million , $ 26 million and $ 23 million of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, related to stock options. Restrictions on the restricted stock issued under the Plans generally lapse according to one of the following schedules: (1) the restrictions on the restricted stock lapse over various periods up to five years, (2) the restrictions on 25% of the restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing upon the associates attainment of age 62, or (3) the restrictions on 25% of the restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing upon the earlier of the associates attainment of age 60 or the tenth anniversary of the grant date. The Company has also granted performance shares under the Plans, the payout of which is dependent on the Companys performance against target average return on invested capital and operating profit over a three-year performance cycle. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associates attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The fair value of the restricted stock and performance shares is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and performance shares of $ 199 million , $ 180 million and $ 168 million in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. In fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , there were an aggregate of 139 thousand , 152 thousand and 206 thousand deferred shares, respectively, granted under the Plans. For associates, each deferred share entitles the individual to one share of common stock to be received up to five years after the grant date of the deferred shares, subject to certain deferral rights of the associate. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to deferred shares of $ 16 million , $ 15 million and $ 14 million in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The Company maintains two Employee Stock Purchase Plans (\"ESPPs\") (U.S. and non-U.S. plans). The plan for U.S. associates is a tax-qualified plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The non-U.S. plan is not a Section 423 plan. As of January 29, 2017 , there were 21 million shares available under the plan for U.S associates and 19 million shares available under the non-U.S. plan. The purchase price of shares under the ESPPs is equal to 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day of the purchase period, which is a six-month period ending on December 31 and June 30 of each year. During fiscal 2016 , there were 1 million shares purchased under the ESPPs at an average price of $ 111.14 . Under the outstanding ESPPs as of January 29, 2017 , employees have contributed $ 15 million to purchase shares at 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day ( June 30, 2017 ) of the current purchase period. The Company recognized $ 26 million , $ 23 million and $ 20 million of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, related to the ESPPs. In total, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense, including the expense of stock options, restricted stock, performance shares, deferred shares and ESPP shares, of $ 267 million , $ 244 million and $ 225 million , in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. 51 The following table summarizes stock options outstanding at January 29, 2017 and changes during fiscal 2016 (shares in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Number of Shares  Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at January 31, 2016 9,466  $ 59.97 Granted 1,121  130.10 Exercised (1,616 )  44.94 Canceled (251 )  97.32 Outstanding at January 29, 2017 8,720  $ 70.69 ##TABLE_ENDThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $ 140 million , $ 206 million and $ 234 million in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS ##TABLE_END The Company maintains active defined contribution retirement plans for its employees (the \"Benefit Plans\"). All associates satisfying certain service requirements are eligible to participate in the Benefit Plans. The Company makes cash contributions each payroll period up to specified percentages of associates contributions as approved by the Board of Directors. The Company also maintains a restoration plan to provide certain associates deferred compensation that they would have received under the Benefit Plans as a matching contribution if not for the maximum compensation limits under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company funds the restoration plan through contributions made to a grantor trust, which are then used to purchase shares of the Companys common stock in the open market. The Companys contributions to the Benefit Plans and the restoration plan were $ 195 million , $ 186 million and $ 182 million for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. At January 29, 2017 , the Benefit Plans and the restoration plan held a total of 8 million shares of the Companys common stock in trust for plan participants.  52 ##TABLE_START 9. INTERLINE ACQUISITION ##TABLE_END On August 24, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Interline, which established a platform in the maintenance, repair and operations (\"MRO\") market. The aggregate purchase price of this acquisition was $1.7 billion . A portion of the purchase price was used for the repayment of substantially all of Interlines existing indebtedness. The acquisition was accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 805 \"Business Combinations\" and, accordingly, Interlines results of operations have been consolidated in the Companys financial statements since the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not material. Pro forma results of operations would not be materially different as a result of the acquisition and therefore are not presented. The Company finalized its purchase price allocation during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition for Interline (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fair Value Cash $ Receivables Inventories Property and Equipment Intangible Assets Goodwill Other Assets Total Assets Acquired 2,049   Current Liabilities Other Liabilities Total Liabilities Assumed   Net Assets Acquired $ 1,672 ##TABLE_ENDThe intangible assets acquired consist of customer relationships of $310 million , with a weighted average useful life of 12 years, and tradenames of $253 million , with an indefinite life, which are included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Goodwill of $788 million represents future economic benefits expected to arise from the Companys expanded presence in the MRO market and expected revenue and purchasing synergies. Both the intangible assets and Goodwill acquired are not deductible for income tax purposes. ##TABLE_START 10. INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY HOLDINGS, INC. ##TABLE_END At the end of fiscal 2013, the Company owned 16.3 million shares of HD Supply Holdings, Inc. (\"HD Supply\") common stock, which represented approximately 8% of the shares of HD Supply common stock outstanding. This investment was accounted for using the cost method, as there were significant restrictions in place on the Companys ability to sell or transfer its HD Supply shares. The restrictions were controlled by the three largest shareholders of HD Supply (the \"Principal Shareholders\") for so long as they continued to own a certain portion of their original holdings of HD Supply. The carrying value of the HD Supply shares was impaired by the Company to a zero cost basis in fiscal 2009. In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, the Principal Shareholders elected to sell shares of HD Supply common stock in a secondary public offering (the \"May 2014 Offering\"). Under the terms of a registration rights agreement among the Company, HD Supply and the Principal Shareholders (the \"Registration Rights Agreement\"), the Company had the right to include a portion of its shares in the May 2014 Offering and elected to do so. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014, two of the Principal Shareholders again elected to sell shares of HD Supply common stock in secondary public offerings, and the Company again exercised its rights under the Registration Rights Agreement to include a portion of its shares in these offerings. As a result of all of these offerings (including an overallotment option exercised during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 by the underwriters of the May 2014 Offering), the Company sold 12.2 million shares of HD Supply common stock in fiscal 2014, for which it received $ 323 million of proceeds and recognized a corresponding gain in fiscal 2014. The total pretax gain of $ 323 million is included in Interest and Investment Income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2014. 53 During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the remaining Principal Shareholder elected to sell shares of HD Supply common stock in a secondary public offering, and the Company again exercised its rights under the Registration Rights Agreement to include its shares in this offering. As a result, the Company sold its remaining 4.1 million shares of HD Supply common stock in fiscal 2015, for which it received $ 144 million of proceeds and recognized a corresponding gain in fiscal 2015. The total pretax gain of $ 144 million is included in Interest and Investment Income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_START 11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ##TABLE_END The fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties. A liabilitys fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, rather than the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers are: ##TABLE_START  Level 1  Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets  Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  Level 3  Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions ##TABLE_ENDAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The assets and liabilities of the Company that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 were as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fair Value at January 29, 2017 Using  Fair Value at January 31, 2016 Using  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Derivative agreements - assets $   $  $   $   $  $  Derivative agreements - liabilities         (82 )   Total $   $  $   $   $  $  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate exposure on long-term debt and its exposure on foreign currency fluctuations. The fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments was measured using level 2 inputs. The Companys derivative agreements are discussed further in Note 4. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets were analyzed for impairment on a nonrecurring basis using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3). Impairment charges related to long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal 2016 and 2015 were not material, as further discussed in Note 1 under the captions \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\" and \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\", respectively. The estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for Interline, which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, were measured using unobservable inputs (level 3). See Note 9 for further discussion of the Interline acquisition. The aggregate fair value of the Companys senior notes, based on quoted market prices, was $ 23.6 billion and $ 21.8 billion at January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 , respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 22.0 billion and $ 20.1 billion at January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 , respectively. 54 ##TABLE_START 12. BASIC AND DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES ##TABLE_END The reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average common shares for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was as follows (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended  January 29, 2017  January 31, 2016  February 1, 2015 Weighted average common shares 1,229  1,277  1,338 Effect of potentially dilutive securities:      Stock plans   Diluted weighted average common shares 1,234  1,283  1,346 ##TABLE_ENDStock plans consist of shares granted under the Companys employee stock plans as described in Note 7. Options to purchase 1 million , 1 million and 1 million shares of common stock at January 29, 2017 , January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 , respectively, were excluded from the computation of Diluted Earnings per Share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_START 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ##TABLE_END At January 29, 2017 , the Company was contingently liable for approximately $473 million under outstanding letters of credit and open accounts issued for certain business transactions, including insurance programs, trade contracts and construction contracts. The Companys letters of credit are primarily performance-based and are not based on changes in variable components, a liability or an equity security of the other party. In addition to the Data Breach described below, the Company is involved in litigation arising from the normal course of business. In managements opinion, this litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Data Breach As previously reported, in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company confirmed that its payment data systems were breached, which potentially impacted customers who used payment cards at self-checkout systems in the Companys U.S. and Canadian stores (the \"Data Breach\"). The Data Breach resulted in a number of claims against the Company, the majority of which have been finally or preliminarily resolved, as follows. Payment Card Networks. The four major payment card networks made claims against the Company for costs that they assert they or their issuing banks incurred in connection with the Data Breach. The Company entered into settlement agreements with all four networks in fiscal 2015. Customer Class Actions . A number of putative class actions were filed in the U.S. and Canada on behalf of customers allegedly harmed by the Data Breach. In the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the respective courts approved settlement agreements that resolved and dismissed all of these claims. Financial Institution Class Actions . A number of putative class actions were filed in the U.S. on behalf of financial institutions allegedly harmed by the Data Breach. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company agreed to settlement terms that, upon approval of the court, will resolve and dismiss the claims asserted in those actions. The Company previously recorded accruals for estimated probable losses in connection with the matters described above. While the Companys estimates may change as new information becomes available, it does not believe any adjustments to the accruals will be material. Pending Matters. Two purported shareholder derivative actions, which were consolidated into a single complaint, were filed against the Company, as a nominal defendant, and certain present and former members of the Companys Board of Directors and executive officers. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the complaint. The shareholders appealed the dismissal to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. In addition, a group of State Attorneys General is investigating events related to the Data Breach, including how it occurred, its consequences and the Companys responses. The Company is cooperating in this investigation. While losses from these pending matters are reasonably possible, the Company is not able to estimate the costs, or range of costs, related to these matters. The Company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an 55 estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The Company does not believe that the ultimate amount paid on these pending matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods. Expenses Incurred and Amounts Accrued In fiscal 2016, the Company recorded $37 million of pretax expenses related to the Data Breach. The Company did not record any related expected insurance proceeds in fiscal 2016. Since the Data Breach occurred, the Company has recorded $298 million of pretax gross expenses related to the Data Breach, partially offset by $100 million of expected insurance proceeds, for pretax net expenses of $198 million . These expenses include costs to investigate and respond to the Data Breach and pay legal and other professional services, all of which were expensed as incurred. Expenses also include the accruals for estimated probable losses that the Company has incurred or expects to incur in connection with the Data Breach as of the end of fiscal 2016. These expenses are included in SGA expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At January 29, 2017 , accrued liabilities and insurance receivable related to the Data Breach consisted of the following (amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Accrued Liabilities  Insurance Receivable (Expenses incurred) insurance receivable recorded in fiscal 2014 $ (63 )  $ Payments made (received) in fiscal 2014  (10 ) Balance at February 1, 2015 (12 )  (Expenses incurred) insurance receivable recorded in fiscal 2015 (198 )  Payments made (received) in fiscal 2015  (20 ) Balance at January 31, 2016 (34 )  (Expenses incurred) insurance receivable recorded in fiscal 2016 (37 )   Payments made (received) in fiscal 2016  (50 ) Balance at January 29, 2017 $ (32 )  $ ##TABLE_ENDFuture Costs The Company also expects to incur additional legal and other professional services expenses associated with the Data Breach in future periods and will recognize these expenses as services are received. The Company does not believe that the ultimate amount paid for these services will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods. Insurance Coverage The Company maintained $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage in fiscal 2014, above a $7.5 million deductible, to limit the Companys exposure to losses such as those related to the Data Breach. As of January 29, 2017 , the Company had received initial payments totaling $80 million of insurance reimbursements under the fiscal 2014 policy, and expects to receive additional payments. The Company maintained $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage in fiscal 2015 and 2016, above a $10 million deductible, to limit the Companys exposure to similar losses. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company entered into a new policy, with $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage above a $10 million deductible, to limit the Companys exposure to similar losses. 56 ##TABLE_START 14.

Business. Introduction The Home Depot, Inc. is the worlds largest home improvement retailer based on net sales for fiscal 2017 . We offer our customers a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, and dcor products and provide a number of services, including home improvement installation services and tool and equipment rental. As of the end of fiscal 2017 , we had 2,284 The Home Depot stores located throughout the U.S., including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam, Canada, and Mexico. The Home Depot stores average approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. We also maintain a network of distribution and fulfillment centers, as well as a number of e-commerce websites. When we refer to \"The Home Depot,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\" in this report, we are referring to The Home Depot, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Home Depot, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1978. Our Store Support Center (corporate office) is located at 2455 Paces Ferry Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Our telephone number is (770) 433-8211. Our Business Our Strategy Our two primary objectives are growing market share with our customers and delivering shareholder value. We have historically been guided by three principles to drive growth: delivering an exceptional customer experience, leading in product authority, and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. These principles reflect how we fundamentally run our business. As the retail landscape continues to rapidly evolve, we must become more agile in responding to the changing competitive landscape and customer preferences. Our customers expect to be able to buy how, when and where they want. We believe that providing a seamless and frictionless shopping experience across multiple channels, featuring curated and innovative product choices, personalized for the individual shoppers need, which are then delivered in a fast and cost-efficient manner, will be a key enabler for our future success. This is our vision for One Home Depot. We have been focused on providing this interconnected retail experience to drive value for our customers, our associates, our suppliers and our shareholders. With that in mind, we have refined our strategic principles into the following five key strategies designed to drive growth in our business: ##TABLE_START  Connect associates to customer needs ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Interconnected experience: stores to online, and online to stores ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Connect products and services to customer needs ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Connect product to shelf, site and customer ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Innovate our business model and value chain ##TABLE_END Taken together, these strategies will help us to create the One Home Depot experience that our customers demand. Below are some of the ways we have been investing in that experience during fiscal 2017. Connect Associates to Customer Needs We serve two primary customer groups and have different approaches to meet their needs: ##TABLE_START  DIY Customers. These customers are typically home owners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. Our associates assist these customers both in our stores and through online resources and other media designed to provide product and project knowledge. We also offer a variety of clinics and workshops both to share this knowledge and to build an emotional connection with our DIY customers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Professional Customers (or Pros) . These customers are primarily professional renovators/remodelers, general contractors, handymen, property managers, building service contractors and specialty tradesmen, such as installers. We recognize the great value our Pro customers provide to their clients, and we strive to make the Pros job easier. For example, we offer our Pros a wide range of special programs such as delivery and will-call services, dedicated sales and service staff, enhanced credit ##TABLE_ENDprograms, designated parking spaces close to store entrances and bulk pricing programs for both online and in-store purchases. In addition, we maintain a loyalty program, Pro Xtra, that provides our Pros with discounts on useful business services, exclusive product offers, and a purchase tracking tool to enable receipt lookup online and job tracking of purchases across all forms of payment. We also serve Pros in the MRO market where our customers are primarily institutions (such as educational and healthcare institutions), hospitality businesses, and national, multi-family apartment complexes. Through our entry into this market with our acquisition of Interline in fiscal 2015, we gained additional competencies relevant to our large Pro customers, including outside sales and account management, expanded product assortment, and last mile delivery capabilities. During fiscal 2017, we continued our integration efforts, rolling out Pro MRO in all U.S. stores, giving customers in our stores access to Interline's assortment. Similarly, we launched our Pro Purchase program, which gives Interline customers the ability to shop our stores using their house accounts. Our Pros have differing needs depending on the type of work they perform. Our goal is to develop a comprehensive set of capabilities for our Pros to provide solutions across every purchase opportunity, such as supplying both recurring MRO needs and renovation products and services to property managers or providing inventory management solutions for specialty tradesmens replenishment needs. In fiscal 2017, we enhanced our service offering to our Pros through our acquisition of Compact Power, a national provider of equipment rental and maintenance services. We believe that by bringing our best resources to bear for each individual customer, we can provide a differentiated customer experience and enhanced value proposition for our Pro customers. Intersecting our DIY customers and our Pros are our DIFM customers . These customers are typically home owners who purchase materials and hire Pros to complete the project or installation. Our stores offer a variety of installation services available to DIFM customers who purchase products and installation of those products from us in our stores, online or in their homes through in-home consultations. Our installation programs include many categories, such as flooring, cabinets, countertops, water heaters and sheds. In addition, we provide third-party professional installation in a number of categories sold through our in-home sales programs, such as roofing, siding, windows, cabinet refacing, furnaces and central air systems. We believe that changing demographics are increasing the demand for our installation services, particularly for our \"baby boomer\" customers who may have historically been DIY customers but who are now looking for someone to complete a project for them. We also believe our focus on serving the Pros who perform services for our DIFM customers will help us drive higher product sales. We help our customers finance their projects by offering private label credit card, or PLCC products through third-party credit providers. Our private label credit program includes other benefits, such as a 365-day return policy and, for our Pros, commercial fuel rewards and extended payment terms. In fiscal 2017, our customers opened approximately 4.4 million new The Home Depot private label credit accounts, and at the end of fiscal 2017 the total number of The Home Depot active account holders was approximately 15 million. PLCC sales accounted for approximately 23% of net sales in fiscal 2017. We strive to provide an outstanding customer experience by putting customers first and taking care of our associates. Our customer experience begins with excellent customer service, and our associates are key to delivering on that experience. Our goal is to remove complexity and inefficient processes from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers. In fiscal 2017, we continued to invest in freight handling capabilities as part of an end-to-end initiative to optimize how product flows from suppliers to our shelves. Among other benefits, this initiative improves our on-shelf availability while decreasing the amount of time a store associate spends locating product on the receiving dock or in overhead storage. In addition, we are implementing a new order management system called Order Up to consolidate certain of our existing legacy systems into a simple and intuitive user interface. These efforts will allow our associates to devote more time to the customer and make working at The Home Depot a better experience. At the end of fiscal 2017, we employed approximately 413,000 associates, of whom approximately 28,000 were salaried, with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis. To attract and retain qualified personnel, we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve. We also have a number of programs to recognize stores and individual associates for exceptional customer service. In fiscal 2017, we announced a one-time bonus to our U.S. hourly associates in light of the benefit we expect to receive from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This bonus was in addition to our semi-annual Success Sharing bonus program for our non-management associates. We measure associate satisfaction regularly, and we believe that our employee relations are very good. Interconnected Experience: Stores to Online, and Online to Stores Our customers are shopping and interacting with us differently today than they did several years ago. As a result, we have taken a number of steps to provide our customers with a seamless and frictionless shopping experience across our stores, online, on the job site, and in their homes. Our stores are the hub of our business, and we are investing to improve the convenience and speed of the customer shopping experience in our stores. For several years, our associates have used FIRST phones, our web-enabled handheld devices, to help expedite the online order checkout process, locate products in the aisles and online, and check inventory on hand. In fiscal 2017, we empowered our customers with additional self-help tools. For example, we invested in a better digital navigation experience through store-specific maps, which allow customers to pinpoint the exact location of an item on their mobile devices. We have also undertaken a number of store pilots in response to customer feedback around navigation and checkout. These pilots include new, more intuitive signage, better lighting, and a redesign of the front end of our store. As part of these store pilots, we added self-service lockers at the front entrance to offer convenient pick up of online orders. We plan to roll out these store pilots more broadly to our U.S. stores over the next several years. We continued to make investments in our website and mobile apps. Enhancements to these digital properties are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers who research products online and then go into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate before making their purchase. While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews, compare prices, view our extended assortment and purchase products. During fiscal 2017, we implemented a new e-commerce platform, enhanced our search and mobile functionality, increased checkout speed, and expanded chat functionality with our online contact centers. We have also begun to focus on voice-enabled commerce to further remove friction for our customers in-store and online. We do not view the customer experience as a specific transaction; rather, it encompasses an entire process from inspiration and know-how, to purchase and fulfillment, to post-purchase care and support. Further, we believe that by connecting our stores to online and online to our stores, we drive sales not just in-store but also online. In fiscal 2017, we saw increased traffic to our online properties and improved online sales conversion rates. Sales from our online channels increased over 21% during fiscal 2017. We will continue to leverage our physical and digital assets in a seamless and frictionless way to enhance the end-to-end customer experience. Connect Products and Services to Customer Needs We strive to be the number one retailer in product authority in home improvement by delivering product innovation, assortment and value and by offering a range of home improvement services. In fiscal 2017, we continued to introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our DIY and Pro customers, while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online. We also made two strategic acquisitions to further enhance our offerings to our customers. A typical The Home Depot store stocks approximately 30,000 to 40,000 products during the year, including both national brand name and proprietary items. To enhance our merchandising capabilities, we continued to make improvements to our information technology tools in fiscal 2017 to better understand our customers, provide more localized assortments to fit customer demand, and optimize space to dedicate the right square footage to the right products in the right location. Our online product offerings complement our stores by serving as an extended aisle, and we offer a significantly broader product assortment through our websites, including homedepot.com and blinds.com. In fiscal 2017, we expanded our offering of online dcor categories though our acquisition of The Company Store, an online retailer of textiles and dcor products. We also routinely use our merchandising tools to refine our online assortment to balance the extended choice with a more curated offering. In fiscal 2017, we introduced a number of innovative and distinctive products to our customers at attractive values. Examples of these new products include EGO  56V cordless self-propelled mowers; PPG  Timeless paint; Samsung  Activewash high-efficiency washers; and Leviton  smart lighting controls. During fiscal 2017, we continued to offer value to our customers through a wide range of our proprietary and exclusive brands. Highlights of these offerings include Husky  hand tools, tool storage and work benches, water resistant gloves, dual beam flashlights, diamond tip screwdrivers, 15-in-1 screwdriver/nut drivers, and 3/8 inch drive digital torque wrenches; Hampton Bay  lighting, ceiling fans and kitchen cabinets; Glacier Bay  bath fixtures and toilets, featuring a SuperClean toilet; LifeProof  flooring including carpet, carpet with PetProof  technology, laminate and vinyl flooring; EcoSmart  lighting, featuring all-glass LED light bulbs; Vigoro  lawn care products; and RIDGID  and Ryobi  power tools, featuring Ryobi  40V cordless push mowers. We will continue to assess our merchandising departments and product lines for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within The Home Depots portfolio of proprietary and exclusive brands. We also offer a number of services for our customers. As noted above under Our Customers, we provide a number of special programs for our Pro customers to meet their particular needs, and for our DIY and DIFM customers, we provide a number of installation services. In fiscal 2017, we enhanced our tool rental offering through our acquisition of Compact Power. Currently, we offer tool and equipment rentals at over 1,000 locations across the U.S. and Canada, providing value and convenience for both our Pro and DIY customers. Connect Product to Shelf, Site and Customer We continue to drive productivity and efficiency by building best-in-class competitive advantages in our information technology and supply chain. These efforts are designed to ensure product availability for our customers while managing our costs, which results in higher returns for our shareholders. Given the changing needs of our customers, our goal is to create the fastest and most efficient delivery capabilities in home improvement. During fiscal 2017, we continued to lay the groundwork to meet this goal. We centrally forecast and replenish over 97% of our products through sophisticated inventory management systems and a network of over 200 distribution centers. This network includes multiple distribution center platforms in the U.S., Canada and Mexico tailored to meet the needs of our stores and customers based on the types of products, location, transportation and delivery requirements. These platforms primarily include rapid deployment centers, stocking distribution centers, bulk distribution centers, and direct fulfillment centers. In addition to our distribution centers, we leverage our almost 2,000 U.S. stores as a network of convenient customer pick-up, return and delivery fulfillment locations. For customers who shop online and wish to pick-up or return merchandise at, or have merchandise delivered from, our U.S. stores, we have fully implemented our four interconnected retail programs, BOPIS, BOSS, BORIS and BODFS, which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage. For example, as of the end of fiscal 2017, over 45% of our U.S. online orders were picked up in the store. Efficient delivery is also key. We have developed specialized capabilities for delivering building materials, which is particularly important to our Pro customers. During fiscal 2017, we implemented new and improved delivery capabilities from our stores, including two- and four-hour delivery windows, and we piloted van and car options for faster delivery on small orders in certain markets.  A key component of this strategy is enabled through our technology portfolio, which consists of a network of systems that help us centrally manage customer orders and optimize where, when and how we fulfill them in order to maximize speed, efficiency, and the customers experience. During fiscal 2017, we continued to improve COM, our customer order management platform, and we completed the rollout of our delivery management system, which substantially improves our ability to sell and execute deliveries from our stores. We recognize that our customers expectations are changing rapidly and that our supply chain needs to be responsive to their expectations for how, when and where they choose to receive our products and services. We will continue to improve the productivity and connectivity across our supply chain platforms to achieve the fastest, most efficient delivery capabilities in home improvement. We refer to this process, which encompasses a multi-year effort, as One Home Depot Supply Chain. Competition. Our industry is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. As a result, we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, and service providers, ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online. In each of the markets we serve, there are a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO companies, home dcor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental. We compete, both in-store and online, primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, availability, assortment, and delivery options. With respect to our stores, we also compete based on store location and appearance as well as presentation of merchandise. Our customers routinely use computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices to shop online, read product reviews, and compare prices, products, and delivery options, regardless of whether they shop in-store or online. Further, online and multichannel retailers are increasingly focusing on delivery services, with customers seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, including the success of our investments to build One Home Depot Supply Chain. Innovate Our Business Model and Value Chain In the changing retail environment, we must increase our investments to position our Company for the future. Our customers view us as One Home Depot, and expect us to function in an interconnected, seamless manner. To fully realize the One Home Depot experience, we will continue to connect the various aspects of our business; leverage our scale; and invest in our physical locations, our digital properties, our associates, product and innovation, our Pro and DIY customers, our services business, and our supply chain. Underlying all of these investments is our continued investment in information technology, which provides the backbone of the One Home Depot experience. We continue to focus on driving productivity throughout the business. This process includes lowering our costs and reinvesting in the business to drive higher sales, creating what we refer to as a virtuous cycle. Through technology development, we drive productivity and speed. By focusing on the elimination of waste across the value chain, improved processes, and enabling those processes through simplified systems, we support a cycle of productivity. This virtuous cycle has allowed us to improve the customer experience, increase our competitiveness in the market, and deliver on shareholder value. Our strategy to create the One Home Depot experience is driven by our desire to create value for all stakeholders, including our customers, our associates, our supplier partners, the communities we serve, and our shareholders. We are accelerating our investments in the business within our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our first use of cash has been and will continue to be investing in our business, with use of the remainder guided by our shareholder return principles: ##TABLE_START  Dividend Principle. We target a dividend payout of approximately 55% of prior year earnings, with the goal of increasing our dividend every year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Return on Invested Capital Principle. Our goal is to maintain a high return on invested capital, benchmarking all uses of excess liquidity against the value created for our shareholders through share repurchases. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Share Repurchase Principle. After meeting the needs of the business, we use excess cash to repurchase shares as long as it is value creating. ##TABLE_END In fiscal 2017, we drove higher returns on invested capital, which allowed us to return value to shareholders through $8.0 billion in share repurchases and $4.2 billion in cash dividends, as discussed in Item 7, \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" Other Information Sustainability Efforts The Home Depot is committed to sustainable business practices  from the products that we offer to our customers, to the environmental impact of our operations, to our sourcing activities, to our involvement within the communities in which we do business. We believe these efforts continue to be successful in creating value for our customers, shareholders, and communities. Environmentally Preferred Products and Programs. We offer a growing selection of environmentally preferred products, which supports sustainability and helps our customers save energy, water and money. Through our Eco Options  Program introduced in 2007, we have helped our customers more easily identify products that meet specifications for energy efficiency, water conservation, healthy home, clean air and sustainable forestry. As of the end of fiscal 2017, our Eco Options  Program included over 20,000 products. Through this program, we sell ENERGY STAR  certified appliances, LED light bulbs, tankless water heaters, and other products that enable our customers to save on their utility bills. We estimate that in fiscal 2017 we helped customers save over $1 billion in electricity costs through sales of ENERGY STAR  certified products. We also estimate our customers saved over 79 billion gallons of water resulting in over $700 million in water bill savings in fiscal 2017 through the sales of our WaterSense  -labeled bath faucets, showerheads, aerators, toilets, and irrigation controllers. In 2017, we announced new customer energy, greenhouse gas emissions, and water goals, anchored by our sale of ENERGY STAR  and WaterSense  products. We are committed to providing innovative products that, through proper use, will help to reduce North American customers electricity costs by more than $2.8 billion; greenhouse gas emissions by 20 million metric tons; and water consumption by 250 billion gallons by 2020. Our 2017 Responsibility Report, available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility, describes many of our other environmentally preferred products that promote energy efficiency, water conservation, clean air, and a healthy home. In 2017, we also updated our wood purchasing policy to require FSC certification for wood products from the Amazon or Congo basins. We continue to offer store recycling programs in the U.S., such as an in-store compact fluorescent light, or CFL, bulb recycling program launched in 2008. This service is offered to customers free of charge and is available in all U.S. stores. We also maintain an in-store rechargeable battery recycling program. Launched in 2001 and currently done in partnership with Call2Recycle, this program is also available to customers free of charge in all U.S. stores. Through our recycling programs, in fiscal 2017 we helped recycle over 980,000 pounds of CFL bulbs and over 1.1 million pounds of rechargeable batteries. In fiscal 2017, we also recycled over 200,000 lead acid batteries collected from our customers under our lead acid battery exchange program, as well as over 230,000 tons of cardboard through a nationwide cardboard recycling program across our U.S. operations. We believe our environmentally-preferred product selection and our recycling efforts drive sales, which in turn benefits our shareholders, in addition to our customers, the communities in which we work and live, and the environment. Commitment to Sustainability and Environmentally Responsible Operations . The Home Depot also focuses on sustainable operations and is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner. This commitment impacts all areas of our operations, including energy usage, supply chain and packaging, and store construction and maintenance. In 2015, we announced two major sustainability commitments for 2020. Our first goal is to reduce our U.S. stores energy use by 20% over 2010 levels, and our second goal is to produce and procure, on an annual basis, 135 megawatts of energy for our stores through renewable or alternate energy sources, such as wind, solar and fuel cell technology. As of the end of fiscal 2017, we have 49 stores with solar rooftop power and over 200 fuel cell systems that are either operational or in development, which puts us on track to exceed both of our goals before the end of 2020. We are committed to implementing strict operational standards that establish energy efficient operations in all of our U.S. facilities and continuing to invest in renewable and alternative energy. Additionally, we implemented a rainwater reclamation project in our stores in 2010. As of the end of fiscal 2017, 145 of our stores used reclamation tanks to collect rainwater and condensation from HVAC units and garden center roofs, which is in turn used to water plants in our outside garden centers. Our 2017 Responsibility Report, which uses the Global Reporting Initiative, or GRI, framework for sustainability reporting, provides more information on sustainability efforts in other aspects of our operations. Awards and Recognition . Our commitment to corporate sustainability has resulted in a number of environmental awards and recognitions. In 2017, we received three significant awards from the EPA. The ENERGY STAR  division named us \"Retail Partner of the Year  Sustained Excellence\" for our overall excellence in energy efficiency, and we received the WaterSense  Sustained Excellence Award for our overall excellence in water efficiency. We also received the EPAs \"SmartWay Excellence Award,\" which recognizes The Home Depot as an industry leader in freight supply chain environmental performance and energy efficiency. We also participate in the CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) reporting process. CDP is an independent, international, not-for-profit organization providing a global system for companies and cities to measure, disclose, manage and share environmental information. In 2017, we received a score of A- from CDP, reflecting a high level of action on climate change mitigation, adaptation and transparency. We also were named an industry leader by CDP. Sourcing and Quality Assurance We maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality and innovative products directly from manufacturers around the world. During fiscal 2017, in addition to our U.S. sourcing operations, we maintained sourcing offices in Mexico, Canada, China, India, Southeast Asia and Europe. Our suppliers are obligated to ensure that their products comply with applicable international, federal, state and local laws. In addition, we have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to establishing criteria and overseeing compliance with safety, quality and performance standards for our proprietary branded products. We also have a global supplier SER program designed to ensure that suppliers adhere to high standards of social and environmental responsibility. Safety We are strongly committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates. Our EHS function is dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of our customers and associates, with trained associates who evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a Company-wide basis. Our EHS policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of The Home Depot culture. Some common program elements include: daily store inspection checklists (by department); routine follow-up audits from our store-based safety team members and regional, district and store operations field teams; equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety; departmental merchandising safety standards; training and education programs for all associates, with varying degrees of training provided based on an associates role and responsibilities; and awareness, communication and recognition programs designed to drive operational awareness and understanding of EHS issues. Intellectual Property Our business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, e-commerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business, including our expanding proprietary brands such as HDX  , Husky  , Hampton Bay  , Home Decorators Collection  , Glacier Bay  and Vigoro  . We also maintain patent portfolios relating to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our products or business operations. Seasonality Our business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, and the lowest volume occurs either during our first or fourth fiscal quarter. Available Information Our internet website is www.homedepot.com. We make available on the Investor Relations section of our website, free of charge, our Annual Reports to shareholders, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements, and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such documents with, or furnishing such documents to, the SEC.

Other Financial Information For information on key financial highlights, including historical revenues, profits and total assets, see the \"Selected Financial Data\" on page F-1 of this report and Item 7, \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" For information on net sales by major merchandising department (and related services) and net sales and long-lived assets outside of the U.S., see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and incorporated herein by reference. ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. The risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. You should read these Risk Factors in conjunction with \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. Our industry is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. As a result, we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, and service providers, ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online. In each of the markets we serve, there are a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO companies, home dcor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental. We compete, both in-store and online, primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, availability, assortment, and delivery options. With respect to our stores, we also compete based on store location and appearance as well as presentation of merchandise. Our customers routinely use computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices to shop online, read product reviews, and compare prices, products, and delivery options, regardless of whether they shop in-store or online. Further, online and multichannel retailers are increasingly focusing on delivery services, with customers seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, including the success of our investments in One Home Depot Supply Chain, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. We use our marketing, advertising and promotional programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively, and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape. Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors, such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events, or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape, could affect our prices, our margins, or demand for our products and services. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through the delivery of a superior customer experience or maintenance of effective marketing, advertising or promotional programs, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; consumer preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions or natural disasters, while also managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining an excellent customer experience. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. In addition, each of our primary customer groups has different needs and expectations, many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change. We also need to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group. If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of  or within  a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers. Customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding. As noted above, customers routinely use technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices, determine real-time product availability, and purchase products. Once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products, and they often expect quick, timely, and low-price or free delivery. We must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. We have our BOSS, BOPIS, BODFS and direct fulfillment delivery options, but we cannot guarantee that these or future programs will be implemented successfully or that we will be able to meet customer expectations on delivery times, options and costs. Customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our Company and products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. To the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media, it may impact our brand and reputation. Further, we have an aging store base that requires maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. Our investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect. We must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates. Failure to maintain our stores, utilize our store space effectively, and offer a safe shopping environment; to provide a compelling online presence; to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs; to provide quick and low-price or free delivery alternatives; to differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups; and to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs. Our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, or healthcare benefits. An inability to provide wages and/or benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract employees. Conversely, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our labor costs. In addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. A failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data. In managing our business, we also rely heavily on the integrity of, security of and consistent access to this data for information such as sales, customer data, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment and order fulfillment. For these information technology systems and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must periodically maintain and update them. Our systems and the third-party systems on which we rely are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; security breaches; cyber-attacks, including the use of ransomware; catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, or hurricanes; acts of war or terrorism; and design or usage errors by our associates, contractors or third-party service providers. Although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, such efforts may not be successful. As a result, we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. Disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. Through our information technology developments, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected retail experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices. We use our websites and our mobile app both as sales channels for our products and also as methods of providing inspiration, as well as product, project, and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales. We have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. Multichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer preferences and new developments. We continually seek to enhance all of our online properties to provide an attractive, user-friendly interface for our customers, as evidenced by our recent re-platform of our homedepot.com website. Disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. The implementation of our store, interconnected retail, supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. We recently announced our intent to substantially increase our investments to create the One Home Depot experience, including significant investments over the next five years to build a One Home Depot Supply Chain. These initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high-quality service to our customers, simplify customer interaction, provide our customers with a more interconnected retail experience, and create the fastest, most efficient delivery network for home improvement products. The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers, employing new web-based tools and services, and addressing impacts on inventory levels, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term, lead to product availability issues, and impact profitability. Further, accomplishing these initiatives will require a substantial investment in additional information technology personnel and other specialized personnel. We may face significant competition in the market for these resources and may not be successful in our hiring efforts. Failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. In addition, our store and interconnected retail initiatives, enhanced supply chain, and new or upgraded information technology systems might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. A disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, or damage to our reputation. Such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers; weather-related events; natural disasters; trade policy changes or restrictions; tariffs or import-related taxes; third-party strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns; shipping capacity constraints; third-party contract disputes; supply or shipping interruptions or costs; military conflicts; acts of terrorism; or other factors beyond our control. Any such disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. If our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier and Company information are not successful, we could incur substantial costs and reputational damage and could become subject to litigation and enforcement actions. Our business, like that of most retailers, involves the receipt, storage and transmission of customers personal information, preferences, and payment card information, as well as other confidential information, such as personal information about our associates and our suppliers and confidential Company information. We also work with third-party service providers and vendors that provide technology, systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of this information. Our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third-party service providers or vendors. Hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. We have implemented and regularly review and update systems, processes, and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss. However, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, as well as those of any companies we acquire. There is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data. As we experienced in connection with the data breach we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 (the \"Data Breach\"), any significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or Company data, could result in significant costs, including costs to investigate and remediate, as well as lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in significant costs. We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability, and potentially disrupt our business. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, PayPal, our private label credit cards, an installment loan program, trade credit, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. As a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Uncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions, political climate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance. Our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. Adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets, the economy or the political climate could adversely impact our customers confidence or financial condition, causing them to determine not to purchase home improvement products and services, causing them to delay purchasing decisions, or impacting their ability to pay for products and services. Other factors beyond our control  including unemployment and foreclosure rates; inventory loss due to theft; interest rate fluctuations; fuel and other energy costs; labor and healthcare costs; the availability of financing; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; weather; natural disasters; acts of terrorism; and other conditions beyond our control  could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance. If we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. We buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing, as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by political instability, military conflict, acts of terrorism, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, any disruptions in our suppliers logistics or supply chain networks or information technology systems, and other factors beyond our or our suppliers control. If we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. As part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. We have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. Our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than national brand products, and represent a growing portion of our business. If we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results. Failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our sales and results of operations. Product and service quality issues could negatively impact customer confidence in our brands and our Company. If our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers expectations regarding safety or quality, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks, as well as governmental enforcement actions. Actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to litigation, as well as government enforcement actions, and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. We seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our vendors. If we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, our reputation as a provider of high quality products and services, including both national brand names and our proprietary products, could suffer, damaging our reputation and impacting customer loyalty. In addition, we and our customers have expectations around responsible sourcing. All of our vendors and service providers must comply with our SER standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, sources of supply, and child and forced labor. We have an SER audit process, but we are also dependent on our vendors and service providers to ensure that the products and services we provide comply with our standards. Our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks. As we expand our proprietary product offerings, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. The risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and product recall exposure, and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. To effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our vendors products, which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our vendors. Any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we are unable to manage effectively our installation services business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits and reputational damage, or the loss of our general contractor licenses. We act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our DIFM customers through professional third-party installers. As such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of work performed by our third-party installers. We have established processes and procedures to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. However, if we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and governmental enforcement actions for violations of regulatory requirements, as well as for property damage or personal injury. In addition, we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could adversely affect our business. Our strategic transactions involve risks, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions. We regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, investments, alliances, and other growth and market expansion strategies, with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales, cost savings, synergies and various other benefits. Assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty. In fiscal 2015, we acquired Interline, which we believe has enhanced our ability to serve our Pros. In fiscal 2017, we acquired Compact Power and The Company Store to expand our product and service offerings. With these and any other acquisitions, we need to successfully integrate each target companys products, services, associates and systems into our business operations. Integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. Furthermore, even if the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional liabilities. Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in a strategic transaction may reduce our earnings. Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. These laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; healthcare; data protection and cybersecurity; the sale of some of our products; transportation; logistics; international trade; supply chain transparency; taxes; unclaimed property; energy costs; or environmental matters, including with respect to our installation services business, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations. In fiscal 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Act, which significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretations. The ultimate impact of the Tax Act on us may differ from our current estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as the issuance of any further regulations or guidance that may alter the operation of the U.S. federal income tax code. As we complete our analysis of the Tax Act, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. Further, uncertainties also exist in terms of how U.S. states and foreign countries within which we operate will react to these U.S. federal income tax changes, which could have additional impacts on our effective tax rate. If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profit margins may be negatively impacted. Our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our U.S. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. Our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations and other foreign legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political and economic conditions. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences; potential tariffs and other import-related taxes and controls; greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights; risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery law compliance; and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers. In addition, our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates, which may adversely impact our sales and profit margins. The inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. Prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance. We are predominantly self-insured for a number of different risk categories, such as general liability (including product liability), workers' compensation, employee group medical, automobile claims, and network security and privacy liability, with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. The occurrence of significant claims, a substantial rise in costs to maintain our insurance, or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. We are involved in a number of legal, regulatory and governmental enforcement proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts. Additionally, involvement in these lawsuits, investigations and inquiries, and other proceedings may involve significant expense, divert managements attention and resources from other matters, and impact the reputation of the Company.

For a description of the claims and investigations related to the Data Breach that we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" which description is incorporated herein by reference. SEC regulations require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental provisions if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more. In February 2018, we received a letter from the California South Coast Air Quality Management District (\"SCAQMD\") regarding allegations that we sold certain non-compliant paint thinners and solvents from 2010 to 2015 in violation of applicable rules. We are currently in discussions with SCAQMD. Although we cannot predict the outcome of this matter, we do not expect the outcome to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. As previously reported, in January 2017, we became aware of an investigation by the EPAs criminal investigation division into our compliance with lead-safe work practices for certain jobs performed through our installation services business. We have also previously responded to civil document requests from several EPA regions. We are continuing to cooperate with the EPA. As previously reported, in November 2013, we received subpoenas from the District Attorney of Alameda County, California, working with various District Attorneys and the California Attorney Generals office (collectively, the \"District Attorneys\"), seeking documents and information relating to our disposal of hazardous waste at our California facilities. The District Attorneys sought monetary penalties and certain changes to our operations with respect to the disposal of hazardous waste in California. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Alameda County Superior Court approved a settlement agreement among the parties to resolve this matter for an aggregate of $21 million in penalties, costs, and supplemental environmental projects; the obligation to perform other environmental compliance activities in lieu of additional penalties; and certain injunctive relief.

Participants in the Plans may also exercise stock options by surrendering shares of common stock that the participants already own as payment of the exercise price.

This new repurchase program does not have a prescribed expiration date. At the end of fiscal 2017, approximately $12.9 billion of the December 2017 authorization remained available. ##TABLE_END Sales of Unregistered Securities During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 , we issued 471 deferred stock units under the Home Depot, Inc.

Net earnings were $8.6 billion , or $7.29 per diluted share, and reflected the following: ##TABLE_START  In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, three hurricanes impacted our operations in the continental U.S., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Hurricane-related sales contributed approximately $662 million to net sales in the second half of fiscal 2017. The gross profit on these hurricane-related sales was considerably less than the Company average. We also incurred approximately $170 million of hurricane-related expenses in the second half of fiscal 2017. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we paid a one-time cash bonus to our U.S. hourly associates, which negatively impacted net earnings by $72 million and reduced diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.06. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act, which included a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and a transition to a modified territorial system. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, we recorded a net $127 million charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. This charge resulted in a $0.11 reduction to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017 (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Results for fiscal 2017 also reflected a benefit of $106 million to our provision for income taxes for share-based payment awards resulting from the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, \"Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\" in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This benefit contributed $0.09 to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017. ##TABLE_END We opened three new stores in the U.S. and three new stores in Mexico during fiscal 2017, for a total store count of 2,284 at January 28, 2018. At the end of fiscal 2017, a total of 304 of our stores, or 13.3% , were located in Canada and Mexico. Total sales per square foot were $417.02 in fiscal 2017, and our inventory turnover ratio was 5.1 times at the end of fiscal 2017. In February 2017, our Board of Directors increased our targeted dividend payout ratio to 55% of prior-year diluted earnings per share. Also in February 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous authorization. In December 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the February 2017 authorization. During fiscal 2017, we repurchased a total of 49.5 million shares of our common stock for $8.0 billion through ASR agreements and open market transactions. In February 2018, we announced a 15.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.03 per share. We generated $12.0 billion of cash flow from operations during fiscal 2017. This cash flow, along with $3.0 billion of long-term debt and $850 million of net short-term borrowings in fiscal 2017, was used to repay $500 million of floating rate senior notes that matured in September 2017, fund cash payments of $8.0 billion for share repurchases, pay $4.2 billion of cash dividends, fund $1.9 billion in capital expenditures, and acquire Compact Power and The Company Store. Our ROIC was 34.2% for fiscal 2017. We define ROIC as NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period. For a reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, and our calculation of ROIC, see the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section below.

We believe the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in our consolidated statements of earnings, as well as the percentage change in the associated dollar amounts, are relevant to an evaluation of our business. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal  Fiscal  Fiscal    dollars in millions $  % of Net Sales  $  % of Net Sales  $  % of Net Sales Net sales $ 100,904    $ 94,595    $ 88,519   Gross profit 34,356  34.0 %  32,313  34.2 %  30,265  34.2 % Operating expenses:            Selling, general and administrative 17,864  17.7  17,132  18.1  16,801  19.0 Depreciation and amortization 1,811  1.8  1,754  1.9  1,690  1.9 Total operating expenses 19,675  19.5  18,886  20.0  18,491  20.9 Operating income 14,681  14.5  13,427  14.2  11,774  13.3 Interest and other (income) expense:            Interest and investment income (74 )  (0.1 )  (36 )    (166 )  (0.2 ) Interest expense 1,057  1.0   1.0   1.0 Interest and other, net  1.0   1.0   0.9 Earnings before provision for income taxes 13,698  13.6  12,491  13.2  11,021  12.5 Provision for income taxes 5,068  5.0  4,534  4.8  4,012  4.5 Net earnings $ 8,630  8.6 %  $ 7,957  8.4 %  $ 7,009  7.9 % ##TABLE_END Note: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding.  ##TABLE_START    % Change  Fiscal  Fiscal  Fiscal  Fiscal  Fiscal    2017 vs. 2016  2016 vs. 2015 Selected financial and sales data:          Comparable sales increase (%) (1) 6.8 %  5.6 %  5.6 %  N/A  N/A Comparable customer transactions increase (%) (1) 2.2 %  2.8 %  4.0 %  N/A  N/A Comparable average ticket increase (%) (1) 4.5 %  2.7 %  1.6 %  N/A  N/A Customer transactions (in millions) (1) 1,578.6  1,544.0  1,500.8  2.2 %  2.9 % Average ticket (1) $63.06  $60.35  $58.77  4.5 %  2.7 % Sales per square foot (1) $417.02  $390.78  $370.55  6.7 %  5.5 % Diluted earnings per share $7.29  $6.45  $5.46  13.0 %  18.1 % ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Does not include results for Interline, which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_ENDFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Sales. We assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales. Net Sales . Net sales for fiscal 2017 increased  $6.3 billion , or 6.7% , to $100.9 billion . The increase in net sales in fiscal 2017 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth. Hurricane-related sales contributed approximately $662 million to net sales in the second half of fiscal 2017. Comparable Sales . Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excluding closed stores. Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 365th day of operation. Acquisitions, digital or otherwise, are included after we own them for greater than 52 weeks (with the exception of Interline which is excluded from comparable sales). Comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. Total comparable sales increased  6.8% in fiscal 2017. The increase in comparable sales reflected a number of factors, including the execution of our strategy and broad-based growth across our stores and online. Online sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 6.7% of net sales and grew 21.5% during fiscal 2017. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales except for one, which was flat in fiscal 2017. Comparable sales for our Lumber, Electrical, Tools, Appliances, Flooring, Building Materials, and Indoor Garden merchandising departments were above the Company average during fiscal 2017. Our comparable customer transactions increased 2.2% during fiscal 2017. Further, our comparable average ticket increased 4.5% in fiscal 2017, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases in certain merchandising departments, such as Appliances and Flooring. Gross Profit.  Gross profit increased  $2.0 billion , or 6.3% , to $34.4 billion in fiscal 2017. Gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.0% in fiscal 2017 compared to 34.2% in fiscal 2016. The modest decline in gross profit margin for fiscal 2017 reflected the impact of lower margin hurricane-related sales and higher shrink, partially offset by benefits from our supply chain. Operating Expenses. Our operating expenses are composed of SGA and depreciation and amortization. Selling, General  Administrative .  SGA increased  $732 million , or 4.3% , to $17.9 billion in fiscal 2017 and included approximately $170 million of hurricane-related expenses. As a percent of net sales, SGA was 17.7% for fiscal 2017 compared to 18.1% for fiscal 2016. The decrease in SGA as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2017 reflected expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment and continued expense control. Depreciation and Amortization .  Depreciation and amortization increased  $57 million , or 3.2% , in fiscal 2017. The decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales to 1.8% in fiscal 2017 from 1.9% in fiscal 2016 reflected expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment. Interest and Other, net.  Interest and other, net, was $983 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $936 million for fiscal 2016. Interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 1.0% for both fiscal 2017 and 2016 and reflected additional interest expense in fiscal 2017 resulting from higher long-term debt balances in fiscal 2017, offset by higher interest income in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Provision for Income Taxes.  Our combined effective income tax rate was 37.0% for fiscal 2017 compared to 36.3% for fiscal 2016. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 reflected a net $127 million charge resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 also reflected a $106 million benefit to our provision for income taxes for share-based payment awards as a result of our adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 (see Note 1 and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion). Diluted Earnings per Share.  Diluted earnings per share were $7.29 for fiscal 2017 compared to $6.45 for fiscal 2016. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 included a benefit of $0.09 per share as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, as well as decreases of $0.11 per share due to the net tax charge recorded in connection with the enactment of the Tax Act and $0.06 per share due to the one-time bonus payment to hourly associates made as a result of the Tax Act. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Sales. Net Sales .  Net sales for fiscal 2016 increased $6.1 billion, or 6.9%, to $94.6 billion. The increase in net sales for fiscal 2016 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth, as well as sales from Interline, which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The increase in net sales was partially offset by pressure from a stronger U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted total sales growth by $549 million in fiscal 2016. Comparable Sales . Total comparable sales increased 5.6% for fiscal 2016, which reflected a number of factors, including the execution of our strategy, improved strength across our business, and an improved U.S. home improvement market. Online sales represented 5.9% of net sales and grew 19.3% during fiscal 2016. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales for fiscal 2016. Comparable sales for our Appliances, Tools, Lumber, Lighting, Dcor, Building Materials, and Indoor Garden merchandising departments were above the Company average for fiscal 2016. Further, our comparable customer transactions increased 2.8% for fiscal 2016 and comparable average ticket increased 2.7% for fiscal 2016, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases in merchandising departments such as Appliances, Flooring, and Roofing, offset in part by a stronger U.S. dollar. Gross Profit. Gross profit for fiscal 2016 increased $2.0 billion, or 6.8%, to $32.3 billion. Gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.2% for both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Gross profit margin for fiscal 2016 reflected the impact of product mix changes, offset by benefits from our supply chain driven by increased productivity, and benefits from reaching higher levels of co-op allowances and rebates in certain category classes. Operating Expenses. Selling, General  Administrative .  SGA for fiscal 2016 increased $331 million, or 2.0%, to $17.1 billion. SGA included Data Breach-related pretax expenses of $37 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $128 million of pretax net expenses in fiscal 2015. As a percent of net sales, SGA was 18.1% for fiscal 2016 compared to 19.0% for fiscal 2015. The decrease in SGA as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2016 reflected expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment and strong expense control. Depreciation and Amortization .  Depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2016 increased $64 million, or 3.8%, to $1.8 billion. Depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 1.9% for both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2016 reflected minor expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment. Interest and Other, net.  In fiscal 2016, we recognized $936 million of interest and other, net, compared to $753 million for fiscal 2015. Interest and other, net, for fiscal 2015 included a $144 million pretax gain related to the sale of our remaining equity ownership in HD Supply. Interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 1.0% for fiscal 2016 compared to 0.9% for fiscal 2015 due primarily to the HD Supply pretax gain in fiscal 2015 noted above and higher long-term debt balances in fiscal 2016. Provision for Income Taxes. Our combined effective income tax rate was 36.3% for fiscal 2016 and 36.4% for fiscal 2015. Diluted Earnings per Share. Diluted earnings per share were $6.45 for fiscal 2016 compared to $5.46 for fiscal 2015. Expenses related to the Data Breach resulted in decreases of $0.02 and $0.06 to diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. The gain on the sale of our remaining equity ownership in HD Supply contributed a benefit of $0.07 to diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-GAAP financial measures. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies. Return on Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. We define ROIC as NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by average debt and equity. We define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period. The calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure), follows. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal  Fiscal  Fiscal dollars in millions   Net earnings $ 8,630  $ 7,957  $ 7,009 Interest and other, net   Provision for income taxes 5,068  4,534  4,012 Operating income 14,681  13,427  11,774 Income tax adjustment (1) (5,432 )  (4,874 )  (4,286 ) NOPAT $ 9,249  $ 8,553  $ 7,488       Average debt and equity $ 27,074  $ 27,203  $ 26,663       ROIC 34.2 %  31.4 %  28.1 % ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Income tax adjustment is defined as operating income multiplied by our effective tax rate. ##TABLE_END Additional Information For information on accounting pronouncements that have impacted or are expected to materially impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities. Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, operations and occupancy costs. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $2.2 billion in fiscal 2017 and increased $410 million in fiscal 2016, and primarily reflected an increase in net earnings, excluding changes in working capital and non-cash items from operations. The increase in earnings resulted from higher comparable sales and expense leverage in both fiscal years. Cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities primarily reflected: ##TABLE_START  $1.9 billion of capital expenditures for investments in our business and $374 million cash paid in connection with the acquisitions of Compact Power and The Company Store in fiscal 2017; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $1.6 billion of capital expenditures for investments in our business in fiscal 2016; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $1.7 billion paid in connection with the acquisition of Interline and $1.5 billion of capital expenditures for investments in our business in fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_END Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities primarily reflected: ##TABLE_START  $8.0 billion of share repurchases and $4.2 billion of cash dividends paid, partially offset by $3.3 billion of net proceeds from short- and long-term borrowings in fiscal 2017; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $6.9 billion of share repurchases and $3.4 billion of cash dividends paid, partially offset by $2.3 billion of net proceeds from short- and long-term borrowings in fiscal 2016; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $7.0 billion of share repurchases and $3.0 billion of cash dividends paid, partially offset by $4.0 billion of net proceeds from short- and long-term borrowings in fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_END Cash and Cash Equivalents at End of Year. At January 28, 2018 , we had $3.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $3.2 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our current cash position, access to the long-term debt capital markets, and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases, and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. Debt and Derivatives In December 2017, we increased the borrowing capacity of our commercial paper programs from $2.0 billion to $3.0 billion . All of our short-term borrowings in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were under these commercial paper programs. In connection with these programs, we have back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $3.0 billion . In December 2017, we replaced our five-year $2.0 billion credit facility that was scheduled to expire in December 2019, with a new, substantially identical five-year $2.0 billion credit facility that expires in December 2022 . In addition, we added a separate 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility that expires in December 2018 . At January 28, 2018 , we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the credit facilities, and none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. At January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017 , there were $1.6 billion and $710 million , respectively, of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs. We also issue senior notes from time to time. We use derivative financial instruments in the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rates on certain long-term debt. See Note 4 and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt and derivative agreements. Leases We use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers, and store support centers. See Note 3 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our capital and operating leases. Share Repurchases In fiscal 2017, we repurchased 49.5 million shares of our common stock for $8.0 billion through ASR agreements and open market transactions. In February 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous authorization. In December 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the February 2017 authorization. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our share repurchases. Contractual Obligations Our significant contractual obligations at January 28, 2018 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Payments Due by Period in millions Total  Less than 1 Year  1 to 3 Years  3 to 5 Years  More Than 5 Years Short-term debt $ 1,559  $ 1,559  $   $   $  Long-term debt  principal payments (1) 24,750  1,150  2,750  3,600  17,250 Long-term debt  interest payments (2) 15,167   1,739  1,526  10,988 Capital lease obligations (3) 1,753     1,044 Operating lease obligations 7,138   1,655  1,276  3,286 Purchase obligations (4) 1,634  1,123    Unrecognized tax benefits (5)        Total $ 52,188  $ 6,001  $ 6,711  $ 6,776  $ 32,700 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Excludes capital lease obligations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Interest payments are calculated at current interest rates, including the impact of active interest rate swaps. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Includes $ 769 million of imputed interest. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, software acquisitions and license commitments, and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) Excludes $ 450 million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash tax payments. ##TABLE_END Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets that are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates. Merchandise Inventories We value the substantial majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method, using the first-in, first-out method, with the remainder of our inventories valued under a cost method. Under the retail inventory method, inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. The retail value of our inventory is adjusted as needed to reflect current market conditions. Because these adjustments are based on current prevailing market conditions, the value of our inventory approximates the lower of cost or market. As the valuation under the retail inventory method is based on estimates such as markups, markdowns, and inventory losses (or shrink), there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross profit. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood for a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to value our inventory under the retail inventory method. We believe that the retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which approximates cost and results in valuing our inventory at the lower of cost or market. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing its undiscounted future cash flows with its carrying value. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition, and inflation. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows, we then measure the assets fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. If the resulting fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized. We generally base our estimates of fair market value on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates of the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations. Impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2017 . Self-Insurance We have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability (including product liability), workers compensation, employee group medical, and automobile claims for which we are self-insured. Our self-insured retention or deductible, as applicable, for each claim involving general liability, workers compensation, and automobile liability is limited to $25 million, $1 million, and $1 million, respectively. We have no stop loss limits for self-insured employee group medical claims. Our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred at the balance sheet date. The estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. The liabilities are reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2017 , 2016 or 2015 . Revenues We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or when a service is performed. We estimate the liability for sales returns, including the estimated gross profit impact, based on our historical return levels and believe that our estimate for sales returns is a reasonable reflection of future returns. We defer revenue and the related gross profit for payments received from customers for which the customer has not yet taken possession of merchandise or we have not yet performed the service for the customer. This amount is recorded as deferred revenue. We estimate the gross profit related to deferred revenue using historical rates, which we believe to be a reasonable reflection of future rates. If these estimates significantly differ from actual amounts, our net sales and gross profit could be adversely impacted. Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and co-op advertising allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. We believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors. Volume rebates and certain co-op advertising allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold. Certain co-op advertising allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in SGA. ", "7A": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk. We have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our long-term debt portfolio. We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. At January 28, 2018 , after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, floating rate debt principal was $1.75 billion, or approximately 7% of our debt portfolio. A 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk. We are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. Revenues from these foreign operations accounted for approximately $ 8.5 billion of our revenue for fiscal 2017 . Our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. Commodity Price Risk. We have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ##TABLE_START 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ##TABLE_END Business The Home Depot, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (the \"Company,\" \"Home Depot,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\"), is a home improvement retailer that sells a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, and dcor items and provides a number of services, in stores and online. We operate in the U.S., including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam, Canada, and Mexico. Consolidation and Presentation Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform with the presentation adopted in the current fiscal year. Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31. Fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 each included 52 weeks. Use of Estimates We have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses in preparing these financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents are carried at fair market value and consist primarily of money market funds. Receivables The components of receivables, net, follow. ##TABLE_START in millions January 28, 2018  January 29, 2017 Card receivables $  $ Rebate receivables  Customer receivables  Other receivables  Receivables, net $ 1,952  $ 2,029 ##TABLE_ENDCard receivables consist of payments due from financial institutions for the settlement of credit card and debit card transactions. Rebate receivables represent amounts due from vendors for volume and co-op advertising rebates. Receivables due from customers relate to credit extended directly to customers by certain subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business. The valuation reserve related to accounts receivable was not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2017 or 2016 . Merchandise Inventories The majority of our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, as determined by the retail inventory method. As the inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, the inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Certain subsidiaries, including retail operations in Canada and Mexico, and distribution centers, record merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or market, as determined by a cost method. These merchandise inventories represent approximately 30% of the total merchandise inventories balance. We evaluate the inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2017 or 2016 . Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in merchandise inventories are properly stated. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, \"swell\") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. We calculate shrink based on actual inventory losses occurring as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses occurring between physical inventory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Property and Equipment, including Capitalized Lease Assets Buildings, furniture, fixtures, and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the original term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment follow. ##TABLE_START  Life Buildings 5  45 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 2  20 years Leasehold improvements 5  45 years ##TABLE_ENDWe capitalize certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortize these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to six years. Certain development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred. We evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing its undiscounted future cash flows with its carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows, we then measure the assets fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. If the resulting fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SGA. When a leased location closes, we also recognize, in SGA, the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. Impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2017 , 2016 , or 2015 . Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill, but assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. Each fiscal year, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments, with a quantitative assessment completed at least once every three years. We completed our last quantitative assessment in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017 , we completed our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for the U.S., Canada, and Mexico reporting units. We performed qualitative assessments, concluding that the fair value of the reporting units substantially exceeded the respective reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill. As a result, there were no impairment charges related to goodwill for fiscal 2017 , 2016 , or 2015 . Changes in the carrying amount of our goodwill follow. ##TABLE_START in millions Fiscal  Fiscal  Fiscal   Goodwill, balance at beginning of year $ 2,093  $ 2,102  $ 1,353 Acquisitions    Other (1)  (9 )  (39 ) Goodwill, balance at end of year $ 2,275  $ 2,093  $ 2,102 ##TABLE_END (1) Primarily reflects the impact of foreign currency translation . We amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 12 years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. Intangible assets are included in other assets. Debt Any premiums or discounts, as the case may be, associated with an issuance of long-term debt are recorded as a direct addition or deduction to the carrying value of the related senior notes and amortized over the term of those notes using the effective interest rate method. Debt issuance costs associated with an issuance of long-term debt are recorded as a direct deduction to the carrying value of the related senior notes and amortized over the term of those notes using the effective interest rate method. Derivatives We use derivative financial instruments in the management of our interest rate exposure on long-term debt and our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. For derivatives that are designated as hedges, changes in their fair values that are considered effective are either accounted for in earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings, depending on the nature of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of a derivatives change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. Financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings. All qualifying derivative financial instruments are recognized at their fair values in either assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date and are reported on a gross basis. The fair values of our derivative financial instruments are discussed in Note 4 and Note 7 . Insurance We are self-insured for certain losses related to general liability (including product liability), workers compensation, employee group medical, and automobile claims. We recognize the expected ultimate cost for claims incurred (undiscounted) at the balance sheet date as a liability. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred is estimated based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. We also maintain network security and privacy liability insurance coverage to limit our exposure to losses such as those that may be caused by a significant compromise or breach of our data security. Insurance related expenses are included in SGA. Treasury Stock Treasury stock is reflected as a reduction of stockholders' equity at cost. We use the weighted-average purchase cost to determine the cost of treasury stock that is reissued. Revenues We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or when a service is performed. The liability for sales returns, including the impact to gross profit, is estimated based on historical return levels. Net sales include services revenue generated through a variety of installation, home maintenance, and professional service programs. In these programs, the customer selects and purchases material for a project, and we provide or arrange professional installation. These programs are offered through our stores and in-home sales programs. Under certain programs, when we provide or arrange the installation of a project and the subcontractor provides material as part of the installation, both the material and labor are included in services revenue. We recognize this revenue when the service for the customer is complete. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the sale or service is complete. We also record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in net sales. Gift card breakage income is recognized based upon historical redemption patterns and represents the balance of gift cards for which we believe the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote. Gift card breakage income, which is recognized as a reduction to SGA, follows. ##TABLE_START in millions Fiscal  Fiscal  Fiscal   Gift card breakage income $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDCost of Sales Cost of sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed; the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to our distribution network, stores, or customers; shipping and handling costs from our stores or distribution network to customers; the operating cost and depreciation of our sourcing and distribution network and online fulfillment centers; and the cost of deferred interest programs offered through our PLCC programs. Cost of Credit We have agreements with third-party service providers who directly extend credit to customers, manage our PLCC program, and own the related receivables. We have evaluated the third-party entities holding the receivables under the program and concluded that they should not be consolidated. The agreement with the primary third-party service provider for our PLCC program expires in 2028 , with us having the option, but no obligation, to purchase the receivables at the end of the agreement. The deferred interest charges we incur for our deferred financing programs offered to our customers are included in cost of sales. The interchange fees charged to us for our customers use of the cards and any profit sharing with the third-party service providers are included in SGA. The sum of these three components is referred to as the cost of credit of the PLCC program. Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and co-op advertising allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and certain co-op advertising allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold. Certain co-op advertising allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in SGA and were as follows: ##TABLE_START in millions Fiscal  Fiscal  Fiscal   Specific, incremental, and identifiable co-op advertising allowances $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDAdvertising Expense Television and radio advertising production costs, along with media placement costs, are expensed when the advertisement first appears. Gross advertising expense is included in SGA. Certain co-op advertising allowances are recorded as an offset against advertising expense. ##TABLE_START in millions Fiscal  Fiscal  Fiscal   Gross advertising expense $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDIncome Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. We provide for federal, state, and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as for those deferred due to timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return which includes certain eligible subsidiaries. Non-U.S. subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, are not eligible to be included in our consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Separate provisions for income taxes have been determined for these entities. For unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, we are required to make an assertion regarding reinvestment or repatriation for tax purposes. For any earnings that we do not make a permanent reinvestment assertion, we recognize a provision for deferred income taxes. For earnings where we have made a permanent reinvestment assertion, no provision is recognized. See Note 5 for further discussion. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income includes net earnings adjusted for certain gains and losses that are excluded from net earnings under GAAP, which consists primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates for the period and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the day of the transaction. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements ASU No. 2016-09. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we adopted ASU No. 2016-09, \"Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\" Upon adoption of this update, all excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to share-based payment awards are recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they occur. Previously these amounts were reflected in paid-in capital. In addition, upon adoption, these amounts are classified as an operating activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows in the period in which they occur. Previously, these amounts were reflected as a financing activity. Cash paid to tax authorities when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes will continue to be classified as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Stock-based compensation expense will continue to reflect estimated forfeitures of share-based awards. We have adopted the applicable provisions of ASU No. 2016-09 prospectively. As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, we recognized $106 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payment awards in our provision for income taxes during fiscal 2017. The recognition of these benefits contributed $0.09 to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements ASU No. 2018-02. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, \"Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income,\" which allows for an optional reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects as a result of the Tax Act. ASU No. 2018-02 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and early adoption is permitted. Two transition methods are available: at the beginning of the period of adoption, or retrospective to each period in which the income tax effects of the Tax Act related to items remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized. We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2018-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. ASU No. 2017-12. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, \"Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities,\" which amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements. ASU No. 2017-12 eliminates the concept of recognizing periodic hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow and net investment hedges and allows an entity to apply the shortcut method to partial-term fair value hedges of interest rate risk. ASU No. 2017-12 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted in any interim period after issuance of this update. We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2017-12 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. ASU No. 2017-04. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, \"IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\" which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment. The amendments in ASU No. 2017-04 require goodwill impairment to be measured using the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit and require the loss recognized to not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU No. 2017-04 should be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for our annual goodwill impairment tests beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted. We have evaluated the effect that ASU No. 2017-04 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and noted no material impact. ASU No. 2016-16. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory,\" which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intercompany transfer of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs. An entity will continue to recognize the income tax consequences of an intercompany transfer of inventory when the inventory is sold to a third party. ASU No. 2016-16 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 using a modified retrospective approach. We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-16 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. ASU No. 2016-02. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842),\" which requires an entity that is a lessee to recognize the assets and liabilities arising from leases on the balance sheet. ASU No. 2016-02 also requires disclosures about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating and planning for the adoption and implementation of ASU No. 2016-02. We believe that ASU No. 2016-02 will have a material impact on our financial position, as a result of the requirement to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The impact to our results of operations is being evaluated, and we do not believe there will be a material impact to our cash flows upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-02. ASU No. 2014-09. In May 2014, the FASB issued a new ASU related to revenue recognition. Under ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\" revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, ASU No. 2014-09 requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. ASU No. 2014-09 permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (modified retrospective method). ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We will adopt ASU No. 2014-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 using the modified retrospective method. This adoption will not materially impact our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. Under ASU No. 2014-09, we will change the presentation of certain expenses and cost reimbursements associated with our PLCC program, certain expenses related to the sale of our gift cards to customers, and gift card breakage income. We will also change our recognition of gift card breakage income to be recognized proportionately as redemption occurs, rather than based on historical redemption patterns. We are in the process of implementing changes to our processes, controls and systems in support of our adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. Recent accounting pronouncements pending adoption not discussed above are either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on us. ##TABLE_START 2. SEGMENT REPORTING ##TABLE_END We currently conduct our retail operations in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, each of which represents one of our three operating segments. Our operating segments reflect the way in which internally-reported financial information is used to make decisions and allocate resources.

All of our senior notes, other than our outstanding floating rate notes, may be redeemed by us at any time, in whole or in part, at the redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the Par Call Date, as defined in the respective notes. Additionally, if a Change in Control Triggering Event occurs, as defined in the notes, holders of all notes have the right to require us to redeem those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. We are generally not limited under the indentures governing the notes in our ability to incur additional indebtedness or required to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing the notes contain various customary covenants; however, none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. Maturities of Long-Term Debt.

The approximate fair values of these agreements were assets of $233 million at January 28, 2018 and $258 million at January 29, 2017, which were the estimated amounts we would have received to settle the agreements, and were included in other assets. We had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with combined notional amounts of $1.25 billion at January 28, 2018 and $1.0 billion at January 29, 2017. These agreements were accounted for as fair value hedges that swap fixed for variable rate interest to hedge changes in the fair values of certain senior notes. The fair values of these agreements were not material at January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017, respectively. At January 28, 2018 , we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with a combined notional amount of $300 million , accounted for as net investment hedges, that hedge against foreign currency exposure on our net investment in certain subsidiaries.

As a result of enactment of the Tax Act, our fiscal 2017 tax provision reflects additional net tax expense of $127 million . As part of the transition to the new territorial tax system, the Tax Act imposes a one-time tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries. For fiscal 2017, these impacts resulted in a provisional charge in the fourth quarter of approximately $400 million , comprising U.S. repatriation taxes, foreign withholding taxes, and state taxes. The lower corporate income tax rate of 21% is effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of approximately 34% for fiscal 2017, and 21% for subsequent fiscal years, which provided a benefit to our fiscal 2017 tax provision of approximately $126 million . The reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate requires a remeasurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal base rate of 21% . This resulted in a provisional benefit of $147 million for fiscal 2017. The Tax Act also added a new provision for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). Due to the complexity of the new tax rules, we are considering available accounting policy alternatives to adopt, to either record the U.S. income tax effect of future GILTI inclusions in the period in which they arise or establish deferred taxes with respect to the expected future tax liabilities associated with future GILTI inclusions. We have not made an accounting policy election and will do so after we complete an analysis of those provisions. On December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") to address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. In accordance with SAB 118, we were able to make reasonable estimates of certain effects and, therefore, recorded provisional amounts for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings.  For the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, we have recorded a provisional benefit of $147 million for the year ended January 28, 2018.  While we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction in corporate rate, it may be affected by other factors, including, but not limited to, changes to our calculation of deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and changes to the current year deferred tax balance estimates. To determine the amount of the income tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, we must determine, in addition to other factors, the amount of post-1986 earnings and profits (\"EP\") of the relevant subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. We are able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax and recorded a provisional obligation of $400 million . However, we are continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the amount of the tax. We expect additional regulatory guidance and technical clarifications from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS within the next 12 months. Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to income tax expense from continuing operations in the quarter of fiscal year 2018 in which the analysis is complete. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities follow. ##TABLE_START in millions January 28, 2018  January 29, 2017 Assets:    Deferred compensation $  $ Accrued self-insurance liabilities  State income taxes  Non-deductible reserves  Net operating losses  Other  Total deferred tax assets  1,505 Valuation allowance   (3 ) Total deferred tax assets after valuation allowance  1,502     Liabilities:    Merchandise inventories (9 )  (64 ) Property and equipment (770 )  (1,128 ) Goodwill and other intangibles (243 )  (368 ) Other (251 )  (147 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (1,273 )  (1,707 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ (321 )  $ (205 ) ##TABLE_ENDOur noncurrent deferred tax assets and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, netted by tax jurisdiction, follow. ##TABLE_START in millions January 28, 2018  January 29, 2017 Other assets $  $ Deferred income taxes (440 )  (296 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ (321 )  $ (205 ) ##TABLE_ENDWe believe that the realization of the deferred tax assets is more likely than not, based upon the expectation that we will generate the necessary taxable income in future periods. At January 28, 2018 , we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, expiring at various dates beginning in 2018 to 2037 . We have concluded that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits related to the federal and state net operating losses will be realized. As of January 29, 2017 , a valuation allowance of $3 million had been provided to reduce the deferred tax asset related to foreign net operating losses to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. As of January 28, 2018 , we are no longer active in the foreign jurisdictions in which the valuation allowance relates; therefore, the valuation allowance of $3 million was released this year when the related deferred tax asset was written off. We intend to reinvest substantially all of the unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries in excess of working capital and strategic requirements and postpone their remittance indefinitely. Accordingly, no provision for withholding taxes was recorded on these unremitted earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. It is impracticable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. We have reevaluated our investment position with respect to certain cash balances and we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest cash in excess of working capital and strategic requirements. Accordingly, we have recorded a provisional deferred tax expense for these unremitted earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. Our income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. For fiscal years 2005 through 2009 , a transfer pricing issue remains open pending negotiations between the U.S. and Mexican tax authorities. Our U.S. federal tax returns for fiscal years 2010 through 2012 are currently under examination by the IRS. During fiscal 2016, the IRS issued a proposed adjustment relating to transfer pricing between our entities in the U.S. and China for fiscal years 2010 through 2012 . We intend to defend our position using all available remedies including bi-lateral relief. There are also ongoing U.S. state and local and other foreign audits covering fiscal years 2005 through 2015 . We do not expect the results from any ongoing income tax audit to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Over the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the resolution of federal and state tax examinations could reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by $187 million . Final settlement of these audit issues may result in payments that are more or less than this amount, but we do not anticipate the resolution of these matters will result in a material change to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

We enter into ASR agreements from time to time with third-party financial institutions to repurchase shares of our common stock. Under an ASR agreement, we pay a specified amount to the financial institution and receive an initial delivery of shares. This initial delivery of shares represents the minimum number of shares that we may receive under the agreement. Upon settlement of the ASR agreement, the financial institution delivers additional shares, with the final number of shares delivered determined with reference to the volume weighted average price per share of our common stock over the term of the agreement, less a negotiated discount. The transactions are accounted for as equity transactions and are included in treasury stock when the shares are received, at which time there is an immediate reduction in the weighted average common shares calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ##TABLE_END The fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties. A liabilitys fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, rather than the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis follow. ##TABLE_START  Fair Value at January 28, 2018 Using  Fair Value at January 29, 2017 Using in millions Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)  Significant Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)  Significant Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Derivative agreements  assets $   $  $   $   $  $  Derivative agreements  liabilities   (12 )         Total $   $  $   $   $  $  ##TABLE_ENDWe use derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of our interest rate exposure on long-term debt and our exposure on foreign currency fluctuations.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, short-term debt, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments. Long-lived assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets were analyzed for impairment on a nonrecurring basis using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3). The estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for Interline, which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, were measured using unobservable inputs (level 3).

EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS ##TABLE_END Omnibus Stock Incentive Plans The Home Depot, Inc. Amended and Restated 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2005 Plan\") and The Home Depot, Inc. 1997 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the \"1997 Plan\" and collectively with the 2005 Plan, the \"Plans\") provide that incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares, performance units, and deferred shares may be issued to certain of our associates, officers, and directors. Under the 2005 Plan, the maximum number of shares of our common stock authorized for issuance is 255 million shares, with any award other than a stock option or stock appreciation right reducing the number of shares available for issuance by 2.11 shares. At January 28, 2018 , there were 130 million shares available for future grants under the 2005 Plan. No additional equity awards could be issued from the 1997 Plan after the adoption of the 2005 Plan on May 26, 2005. Stock Options. Under the terms of the Plans, incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options must have an exercise price at or above the fair market value of our stock on the date of the grant. Typically, incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options vest at the rate of 25% per year commencing on the first or second anniversary date of the grant, and expire on the tenth anniversary date of the grant. Additionally, certain stock options may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service.

Each deferred share entitles the associate to one share of common stock to be received up to five years after the grant date of the deferred shares, subject to certain deferral rights of the associate. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service.

The plan for U.S. associates is a tax-qualified plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The non-U.S. plan is not a Section 423 plan. At January 28, 2018 , there were 20 million shares available under the U.S. plan and 19 million shares available under the non-U.S. plan. The purchase price of shares under the ESPPs is equal to 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day of the purchase period, which is a six-month period ending on December 31 and June 30 of each year. During fiscal 2017 , there were 1 million shares purchased under the ESPPs at an average price of $143.71 . Under the outstanding ESPPs at January 28, 2018 , employees have contributed $17 million to purchase shares at 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day of the current purchase period ( June 30, 2018 ).

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS ##TABLE_END We maintain active defined contribution retirement plans for our employees (the \"Benefit Plans\"). All associates satisfying certain service requirements are eligible to participate in the Benefit Plans. We make cash contributions each payroll period up to specified percentages of associates contributions as approved by our Board of Directors. We also maintain the Restoration Plan to provide certain associates deferred compensation that they would have received under the Benefit Plans as a matching contribution if not for the maximum compensation limits under the Internal Revenue Code. We fund the Restoration Plan through contributions made to a grantor trust, which are then used to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ##TABLE_END At January 28, 2018 , we were contingently liable for approximately $447 million under outstanding letters of credit and open accounts issued for certain business transactions, including insurance programs, trade contracts, and construction contracts. Our letters of credit are primarily performance-based and are not based on changes in variable components, a liability or an equity security of the other party. In addition to the Data Breach described below, we are involved in litigation arising in the normal course of business. In managements opinion, any such litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Data Breach As previously reported, in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we confirmed that our payment data systems were breached, which potentially impacted customers who used payment cards at self-checkout systems in our U.S. and Canadian stores (the \"Data Breach\"). The Data Breach resulted in a number of claims and investigations, a significant number of which had been resolved prior to fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2017, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia approved settlement agreements that resolved and dismissed the claims asserted in the two remaining litigation matters, the financial institution class actions and the purported shareholder derivative actions. We previously recorded accruals for estimated probable losses in connection with the matters described above. As of the end of fiscal 2017, we had resolved the consumer, financial institution, and shareholder derivative claims, representing the significant majority of the claims relating to the Data Breach, and there were no material changes during fiscal 2017 to our loss contingency assessment relating to any remaining matters. Further, we do not believe that the ultimate amounts to be paid with respect to any remaining matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in future periods. As a result, in future filings we do not anticipate providing separate reporting with respect to the Data Breach. ##TABLE_START 12. INTERLINE ACQUISITION ##TABLE_END In August 2015, we completed our acquisition of Interline, which established a platform in the MRO market. The aggregate purchase price was $1.7 billion , a portion of which was used for the repayment of substantially all of Interlines indebtedness at that time. We have consolidated Interlines results of operations in our financial statements since the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations for the period prior to the acquisition in fiscal 2015 would not be materially different as a result of the acquisition and therefore are not presented. We finalized our purchase price allocation during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition for Interline follow. ##TABLE_START in millions Fair Value Current assets $ Long-lived assets other than goodwill Goodwill Other assets Total assets acquired 2,049 Current liabilities Other long-term liabilities Total liabilities assumed Net assets acquired $ 1,672 ##TABLE_ENDIntangible assets acquired consist of customer relationships of $310 million , with a weighted average useful life of 12 years, and trade names of $253 million , with an indefinite life, which are included in other assets. The goodwill of $788 million represents future economic benefits expected to arise from our expanded presence in the MRO market and expected revenue and purchasing synergies. Neither the intangible assets nor the goodwill acquired are deductible for income tax purposes. ##TABLE_START 13. INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY ##TABLE_END In fiscal 2015, the remaining principal shareholder of HD Supply elected to sell its shares of common stock in a secondary public offering, and we exercised our rights under a registration rights agreement to include our shares in this offering. As a result, we sold our remaining shares of HD Supply common stock (with zero cost basis) and recognized a pretax gain of $144 million in interest and investment income in fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_START 14.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2018 based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 28, 2018 in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2018 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. ##TABLE_START /s/ CRAIG A.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\"), the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Home Depot, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017, and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders' Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 28, 2018, and the related notes (collectively, the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\"), and our report dated March 22, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on those Consolidated Financial Statements. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP Atlanta, Georgia March 22, 2018  ", "9B": " Item 9B.

The Home Depot, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1978. Our Store Support Center (corporate office) is located at 2455 Paces Ferry Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Our telephone number at that address is (770) 433-8211. Our Business Our Strategy Our two primary objectives are growing market share with our customers and delivering shareholder value. We have historically been guided by three principles to drive growth: delivering an exceptional customer experience, leading in product authority, and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. These principles reflect how we fundamentally run our business. As the retail landscape continues to evolve, we must become more agile in responding to the changing competitive environment and customer preferences. Our customers expect to be able to buy how, when and where they want. We believe that providing a seamless and frictionless shopping experience across multiple channels, featuring curated and innovative product choices, personalized for the individual shoppers need, which are then delivered in a fast and cost-efficient manner, is a key enabler for our future success. This is what we call the One Home Depot experience. In late 2017, we announced that we would be investing approximately $11 billion over a multi-year period in our stores, associates, digital experience and supply chain to drive value for our customers, our associates, our suppliers and our shareholders. To accomplish this, we are executing against five key strategies designed to drive growth in our business: ##TABLE_START  Connect associates to customer needs ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Interconnected experience: stores to online, and online to stores ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Connect products and services to customer needs ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Connect product to shelf, site and customer ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Innovate our business model and value chain ##TABLE_END Taken together, these strategies are helping us to create the One Home Depot experience that our customers demand. Below are some of the ways we have been investing in that experience during fiscal 2018 . Connect Associates to Customer Needs We serve two primary customer groups and have different approaches to meeting their needs: ##TABLE_START  DIY Customers. These customers are typically home owners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. Our associates assist these customers both in our stores and through online resources and other media designed to provide product and project knowledge. We also offer a variety of clinics and workshops both to share this knowledge and to build an emotional connection with our DIY customers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Professional Customers (or Pros) . These customers are primarily professional renovators/remodelers, general contractors, handymen, property managers, building service contractors and specialty tradesmen, such as electricians, plumbers and painters. These customers build, renovate, remodel, repair and maintain residential properties, multifamily properties, hospitality properties and commercial facilities, including education facilities, healthcare facilities, government buildings and office buildings. We recognize the great value our Pro customers provide to their clients, and we strive to make the Pros' job easier and help them ##TABLE_ENDgrow their business. We believe that investments aimed at deepening our relationships with our Pro customers are yielding increased engagement and will continue to translate into incremental spend. As part of our continued commitment to invest in Pro customer relationships and the significant market opportunity these customers represent, we have created an enhanced Pro customer experience, both online and in-store. At the end of 2018, we announced a new consolidated, go-to-market strategy for all of our Pro initiatives, including our MRO business (formerly known as Interline), under The Home Depot Pro banner. With The Home Depot Pro, Pros have access to a comprehensive offering that includes a combination of our vast store network, a best-in-class dedicated sales force, quality and affordable products from trusted brands, an extensive delivery network and online business solutions. We provide specialized programs such as an expanded MRO assortment, inventory management solutions, custom product offerings, in-store Pro desk and Pro services, and enhanced credit programs. We also provide and are continuously working to improve our delivery options for Pros, including pick up in-store, direct to job site delivery or ship-to home, to allow us to deliver when, where and how our customers demand. Online, our Pros receive a personalized experience based on their business, their needs, their industry and their purchasing behavior. Pro customers are not one-size-fits-all, and The Home Depot Pro offers the level of value-added services that our diverse Pro customers demand. Our Pro loyalty program, Pro Xtra, provides Pros with benefits related to useful business services, exclusive product offers and a purchase monitoring tool to enable receipt lookup and job tracking of purchases across all forms of payment. We will continue to invest in the Pro customer experience to provide the services, solutions, support, and online tools they need to grow their businesses. Intersecting our DIY customers and our Pros are our DIFM customers. These customers are typically home owners who engage with Pros to complete their project or installation, instead of completing the project or installation themselves. DIFM customers can purchase a variety of installation services in our stores, online or in their homes through in-home consultations. Our installation programs include many categories, such as flooring, cabinets and cabinet makeovers, countertops, furnaces and central air systems, and windows. We believe that changing demographics are increasing the demand for our installation services, particularly for our \"baby boomer\" customers who may have historically been DIY customers but who are now looking for someone to complete a project for them. We also believe our focus on serving the Pros who perform services for our DIFM customers will help us drive higher product sales. We help our customers finance their projects by offering PLCC products through third-party credit providers. Our PLCC program includes other benefits, such as a 365-day return policy and, for our Pros, commercial fuel rewards and extended payment terms. In fiscal 2018 , our customers opened approximately 4.8 million new The Home Depot private label credit accounts, and at the end of fiscal 2018 the total number of The Home Depot active account holders was approximately 16 million. PLCC sales accounted for approximately 23% of net sales in fiscal 2018 . We strive to provide an outstanding customer experience by putting customers first and taking care of our associates. Our customer experience begins with excellent customer service, and our associates are key to delivering on that experience. Our goal is to remove complexity and inefficient processes from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers. To this end, in fiscal 2018 we continued to invest in freight handling capabilities as part of an end-to-end initiative to optimize how product flows from suppliers to our shelves. Among other benefits, this initiative improves our on-shelf availability while decreasing the amount of time a store associate spends locating product on the receiving dock or in overhead storage. We deployed our new overhead management application on our FIRST phones, our web-enabled handheld devices, in fiscal 2018 , which helps associates locate product stored in overhead storage quickly and accurately, saving time, improving the customer experience, and assisting with inventory management. In addition, we launched a new order management system called Order Up to consolidate certain of our existing legacy systems into a simple and intuitive user interface that requires minimal training and significantly decreases associate time required to create, sell, manage and edit orders. These efforts allow our associates to devote more time to the customer and make working at The Home Depot a better experience. During fiscal 2018 , we also enhanced our labor model to better align associate activity with customer needs, shifting from a model based on the number of transactions to one that correlates to the specific volume of activity within each store down to the department level. This change, which is now live in all stores, allows us to better allocate our workforce to provide a best-in-class customer experience. At the end of fiscal 2018 , we employed approximately 413,000 associates, of whom approximately 29,000 were salaried, with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis. To attract, reward, and retain qualified personnel, we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve. We also have a number of programs to recognize stores and individual associates for exceptional customer service. In fiscal 2018 , as part of our strategic investments, we made a number of investments in our associates, including changes to our benefits programs to eliminate a waiting period for new hires and an enhanced paid maternity and parental leave program. We measure associate satisfaction regularly, and we believe that our employee relations are very good. Interconnected Experience: Stores to Online, and Online to Stores Our customers are shopping and interacting with us differently today than they did several years ago. As a result, we have taken a number of steps to provide our customers with a seamless and frictionless interconnected shopping experience across our stores, online, on the job site, and in their homes. We do not view the customer experience as a specific transaction; rather, we believe it encompasses an entire process from inspiration and know-how, to purchase and fulfillment and to post-purchase care and support. From the inspirational point of the purchase journey to providing product know-how, we are investing in the infrastructure and processes needed to deliver the most relevant marketing messages to our customers based upon what is important for them today. This means adjusting messages so that they are personalized to the customer, such as showing product that completes their project based upon what was recently purchased, or highlighting products and services that are most relevant based upon changing weather conditions. Customers desire more personalized messaging, so we are focusing on connecting marketing activities with the online and in-store experiences to create a seamless series of contacts across all channels. Doing this well provides tremendous value to the customer, which in turn drives business results. Our stores are the hub of our business, and we are investing to improve the customer shopping experience through easier navigation and increasing the convenience and speed of checkout. For several years, our associates have used our FIRST phones to help expedite the online order checkout process, locate products in the aisles and online, and check inventory on hand. In fiscal 2018 , we empowered our customers with additional self-help tools. As part of our strategic investments, we have made progress with the implementation of our wayfinding sign and store refresh package, with almost 1,300 of our U.S. stores completed by the end of fiscal 2018 , ahead of our original plan. This package includes new, more intuitive signage, better lighting, and basic store enhancements. We also continued the roll out of our re-designed front end area, including optimized layouts in all checkout areas and expanded and enhanced self-checkout options, as well as the addition of self-service lockers at the front entrance to offer convenient pick up of online orders. We continue to make investments in our website and mobile apps. Enhancements to these digital properties are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers who research products online and then go into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate before making their purchase. We also continued to invest in a better digital navigation experience through store-specific maps, which allow customers to pinpoint the exact location of an item on their mobile devices. While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews, compare prices, view our extended assortment and purchase products. During fiscal 2018 , we continued to improve our e-commerce platform with a goal of driving a more personalized customer experience, as discussed above. To create an enhanced customer experience, we have been expanding our use of technology, including machine learning and data sciences. In fiscal 2018 , we continued to enhance our search and mobile functionality, our checkout speed, and our chat functionality with our online contact centers. We believe that by connecting our stores to online and online to our stores, we drive sales not just in-store but also online. In fiscal 2018 , we saw increased traffic to our online properties and improved online sales conversion rates. Sales from our online channels increased over 26% during fiscal 2018 . We will continue to leverage our physical and digital assets in a seamless and frictionless way to enhance the end-to-end customer experience. Connect Products and Services to Customer Needs We strive to be the number one retailer in product authority in home improvement by delivering product innovation, assortment and value and by offering a range of home improvement services. In fiscal 2018 , we continued to introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our DIY and Pro customers, while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online.  To enhance our merchandising capabilities, we continued to make improvements to our information technology tools in fiscal 2018 to build an interconnected shopping experience that is tailored to our customers persona, shopping context, and location; to ensure we have the best value in the market; and to optimize our product assortments. A typical The Home Depot store stocks approximately 30,000 to 40,000 items during the year, including both national brand name and proprietary products. Our online product offerings complement our stores by serving as an extended aisle, and we offer a significantly broader product assortment through our websites, including homedepot.com, blinds.com, and thecompanystore.com, an online retailer of textiles and dcor products that we acquired in late fiscal 2017 to expand our offering of online dcor categories. We also routinely use our merchandising tools to refine our online assortment to balance the extended choice with a more curated offering. In fiscal 2018 , we introduced a number of innovative and distinctive products to our customers at attractive values. Examples of these new products include the Halo Color Selectable LED Downlight Retrofits, Behr Quick Dry Oil-Based Wood Finish, EGO  56V Carbon Fiber PowerLoad Technology Trimmer, Andersen  LuminAire Retractable Screen, and Loctite  PL  Premium Max Construction Adhesive. During fiscal 2018 , we continued to offer value to our customers through a wide range of our proprietary and exclusive brands. Highlights of these offerings include Husky  hand tools, tool storage and work benches, water resistant gloves, dual beam flashlights, diamond tip screwdrivers, and 15-in-1 screwdriver/nut drivers; Everbilt  products, including hardware fasteners, plumbing parts, pumps and garbage disposals; Hampton Bay  lighting, ceiling fans and kitchen cabinets; Glacier Bay  bath fixtures and toilets; LifeProof  flooring including carpet, carpet with PetProof  technology, rigid core vinyl plank flooring, and new slip resistant tiles; EcoSmart  lighting, featuring all-glass LED light bulbs; Vigoro  lawn care products; Stanley  hand tools; Troy-Bilt  outdoor snow throwers; and RIDGID  and Ryobi  power tools, featuring Ryobi  40V cordless push mowers. We will continue to assess our merchandising departments and product lines for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within The Home Depots portfolio of proprietary and exclusive brands. We also offer a number of services for our customers. As noted above, we provide a number of special programs for our Pro customers to meet their particular needs, and for our DIY and DIFM customers, we provide a number of installation services. We also provide tool and equipment rentals at over 1,200 locations across the U.S. and Canada, providing value and convenience for both our Pro and DIY customers. Connect Product to Shelf, Site and Customer We continue to drive productivity and efficiency by building best-in-class competitive advantages in our information technology and supply chain. These efforts are designed to ensure product availability for our customers while managing our costs, which results in higher returns for our shareholders. We recognize that our customers expectations are changing rapidly and that our supply chain needs to be responsive to their expectations for how, when and where they choose to receive our products and services. We will continue to improve productivity and connectivity across our supply chain platforms to achieve the fastest, most efficient delivery capabilities in home improvement. We refer to this process, which encompasses a multi-year effort, as One Home Depot Supply Chain. During fiscal 2018 , we continued to build the foundation to meet this goal. We centrally forecast and replenish over 98% of our store products through sophisticated inventory management systems and utilize a network of over 200 distribution centers to serve both our stores' and customers' needs. This network includes multiple distribution center platforms in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico tailored to meet the needs of our stores and customers based on the types of products, location, transportation, and delivery requirements. These platforms primarily include rapid deployment centers, stocking distribution centers, bulk distribution centers, and direct fulfillment centers. As part of our investment in One Home Depot Supply Chain, we will add a number of different fulfillment facilities designed to help us meet our goal of reaching 90% of the U.S. population with same or next day delivery for an extended home improvement product offering, including big and bulky goods. These facilities include more direct fulfillment centers and market delivery operations, or MDOs, which function as local hubs to consolidate freight for dispatch to customers for the final mile of delivery. In fiscal 2018 , we began piloting these facilities. In addition to our distribution centers, we leverage our almost 2,000 U.S. stores as a network of convenient customer pick-up, return and delivery fulfillment locations. For customers who shop online and wish to pick-up or return merchandise at, or have merchandise delivered from, our U.S. stores, we have fully implemented our four interconnected retail programs, BOSS, BOPIS, BODFS, and BORIS, which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage. For example, as of the end of fiscal 2018 , almost 50% of our U.S. online orders were picked up in the store. We also continue to focus on developing new capabilities to improve both the efficiency and customer experience in our store delivery program. For example, as of the end of fiscal 2018 , we have rolled out van and car delivery to over 70% and 40% of the U.S. population, respectively, which provides our customers with a fast and affordable service for smaller deliveries.  A key component of our strategy is enabled through our technology portfolio, which consists of a network of systems that help us centrally manage customer orders and optimize where, when and how we fulfill them in order to maximize speed, efficiency, and the customers experience. During fiscal 2018 , we continued to improve our customer order management platform, or COM, and our delivery management system, which substantially improves our ability to sell and execute deliveries from our stores. Innovate Our Business Model and Value Chain In the changing retail environment, we must increase our investments to enhance the interconnected customer experience and position our Company for the future. Our customers view us as One Home Depot and expect us to function in an interconnected, seamless manner. To fully realize the One Home Depot experience, we will continue to connect the various aspects of our business and leverage our scale. We will also invest in our physical locations, our digital properties, our associates, products and innovation, our Pro and DIY customers, our services business, and our supply chain. Underlying all of these investments is our continued investment in information technology, which provides the backbone of the One Home Depot experience. We continue to focus on driving productivity throughout the business. This process includes lowering our costs and reinvesting in the business to drive higher sales, creating what we refer to as a virtuous cycle. Through technology development, we drive productivity and speed. By focusing on the elimination of waste across the value chain, improved processes, and simplified systems, we support a cycle of productivity. This virtuous cycle has allowed us to improve the customer experience, increase our competitiveness in the market, increase sales, and deliver on shareholder value. Our strategy to create the One Home Depot experience is driven by our desire to create value for all stakeholders, including our customers, our associates, our supplier partners, the communities we serve, and our shareholders. We are accelerating our investments in the business within our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our first use of cash has been and will continue to be investing in our business, with use of the remainder guided by our shareholder return principles: ##TABLE_START  Dividend Principle. We target a dividend payout of approximately 55% of prior year earnings per share, with the goal of increasing our dividend every year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Return on Invested Capital Principle. Our goal is to maintain a high return on invested capital, benchmarking all uses of excess liquidity against the value created for our shareholders through share repurchases. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Share Repurchase Principle. After meeting the needs of the business, we use excess cash to repurchase shares as long as it is value creating. ##TABLE_END In fiscal 2018 , we drove higher returns on invested capital, which allowed us to return value to shareholders through $10.0 billion in share repurchases and $4.7 billion in cash dividends, as discussed in Item 7, \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" Competition Our industry is highly competitive and evolving. As a result, we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, and service providers, ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online. In each of the markets we serve, there are a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO companies, home dcor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental. We compete, both in-store and online, primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, availability, product assortment, and delivery options. With respect to our stores, we also compete based on store location and appearance as well as presentation of merchandise. Our customers routinely use a variety of electronic devices and platforms to shop online, read product reviews, and compare prices, products, and delivery options, regardless of where or how they shop. Further, online and multichannel retailers are increasingly focusing on delivery services, with customers seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, including the success of our investments in One Home Depot Supply Chain. Sustainability Efforts The Home Depot is committed to sustainable business practices  from the products that we offer to our customers, to the environmental impact of our operations, to our sourcing activities, to our involvement within the communities in which we do business. We believe these efforts continue to be successful in creating value for our customers, shareholders, and communities. Environmentally Preferred Products and Programs. We offer a growing selection of environmentally preferred products, which supports sustainability and helps our customers save energy, water and money. Through our Eco Options  Program introduced in 2007, we have helped our customers more easily identify products that meet specifications for energy efficiency, water conservation, healthy home, clean air and sustainable forestry. As of the end of fiscal 2018, our Eco Options  Program included over 20,000 products. Through this program, we sell ENERGY STAR  certified appliances, LED light bulbs, tankless water heaters, and other products that enable our customers to save on their utility bills. We estimate that in fiscal 2018 we helped customers save over $1.2 billion in electricity costs through sales of energy-saving products. We also estimate our customers saved over 59 billion gallons of water resulting in over $655 million in water bill savings in fiscal 2018 through the sales of our WaterSense  -labeled bath faucets, showerheads, aerators, toilets, and irrigation controllers. In 2017, we announced customer energy, greenhouse gas emissions, and water goals, anchored by our sale of ENERGY STAR  and WaterSense  products. We are committed to providing innovative products that, through proper use, will help to reduce North American customers electricity costs by more than $2.8 billion; greenhouse gas emissions by 20 million metric tons; and water consumption by 250 billion gallons by 2020. We also updated our wood purchasing policy to require FSC certification for wood products from the Amazon basin, Congo basin, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. Our 2018 Responsibility Report, available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility, describes many of our other environmentally preferred products that promote energy efficiency, water conservation, clean air, and a healthy home. We continue to offer store recycling programs in the U.S., such as an in-store CFL bulb recycling program launched in 2008. This service is offered to customers free of charge and is available in all U.S. stores. We also maintain an in-store rechargeable battery recycling program. Launched in 2001 and currently done in partnership with Call2Recycle, this program is also available to customers free of charge in all U.S. stores. Through our recycling programs, in fiscal 2018 we helped recycle over 888,000 pounds of CFL bulbs and over 1 million pounds of rechargeable batteries. Since program inception, we have helped recycle 10 million pounds of rechargeable batteries. In fiscal 2018 , we also recycled over 230,000 lead acid batteries collected from our customers under our lead acid battery exchange program, as well as over 247,000 tons of cardboard through a nationwide cardboard recycling program across our U.S. operations. We believe our environmentally-preferred product selection and our recycling efforts drive sales, which in turn benefits our shareholders, in addition to our customers, the communities in which we work and live, and the environment. Commitment to Sustainability and Environmentally Responsible Operations . The Home Depot also focuses on sustainable operations and is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner. This commitment impacts all areas of our operations, including energy usage, supply chain and packaging, and store construction and maintenance. In 2015, we announced two major sustainability commitments for 2020. Our first goal is to reduce our U.S. stores energy use by 20% over 2010 levels, and our second goal is to produce and procure, on an annual basis, 135 megawatts of energy for our stores through renewable or alternate energy sources, such as wind, solar and fuel cell technology. As of the end of fiscal 2018 , we have 45 stores with solar rooftop power and over 202 fuel cell systems that are either operational or in development, which puts us on track to exceed both of our goals before the end of 2020. In 2018 , we set a Science Based Target goal in connection with our annual CDP reporting (discussed below) with commitments to a 2.1% annual reduction in carbon emissions. Our goal is to achieve a 39.9% reduction by 2030 and a 50.4% reduction by 2035. We are committed to implementing strict operational standards that establish energy efficient operations in all of our U.S. facilities and continuing to invest in renewable and alternative energy. Additionally, we implemented a rainwater reclamation project in our stores in 2010. As of the end of fiscal 2018 , 148 of our stores used reclamation tanks to collect rainwater and condensation from HVAC units and garden center roofs, which is in turn used to water plants in our outside garden centers. Our 2018 Responsibility Report, which uses the Global Reporting Initiative, or GRI, framework for sustainability reporting, provides more information on sustainability efforts in other aspects of our operations. Awards and Recognition . Our commitment to corporate sustainability has resulted in a number of environmental awards and recognitions. From 2008 to 2017, we received 21 significant awards from three EPA programs. Multiple times over these years, the ENERGY STAR  division named us \"Retail Partner of the Year  Sustained Excellence\" for our overall excellence in energy efficiency, and we received the WaterSense  Sustained Excellence Award for our overall excellence in water efficiency. We have also received the EPAs \"SmartWay Excellence Award,\" which recognizes The Home Depot as an industry leader in freight supply chain environmental performance and energy efficiency. We participate in the CDP reporting process. CDP is an independent, international, not-for-profit organization providing a global system for companies and cities to measure, disclose, manage and share environmental information. In January 2019, we received a score of A from CDP, reflecting a high level of action on climate change mitigation, adaptation and transparency. We also were named an industry leader by CDP. Sourcing and Quality Assurance We maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality and innovative products directly from manufacturers around the world. During fiscal 2018 , in addition to our U.S. sourcing operations, we maintained sourcing offices in Mexico, Canada, China, India, Southeast Asia and Europe. Our suppliers are contractually obligated to ensure that their products comply with applicable international, federal, state and local laws. All of our vendors and service providers must comply with our responsible sourcing standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, sources of supply, and child and forced labor. In addition, we have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to establishing criteria and overseeing compliance with safety, quality and performance standards for our proprietary branded products. We also have a global responsible sourcing program designed to ensure that suppliers adhere to high standards of social and environmental responsibility. Our 2018 Responsible Sourcing Report, available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility/sourcing-responsibility, provides more information about this program. Safety We are strongly committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates. Our EHS function is dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of our customers and associates, with trained associates who evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a Company-wide basis. Our EHS policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of The Home Depot culture. Some common program elements include: daily store inspection checklists (by department); routine follow-up audits from our store-based safety team members and regional, district and store operations field teams; equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety; departmental merchandising safety standards; training and education programs for all associates, with varying degrees of training provided based on an associates role and responsibilities; and awareness, communication and recognition programs designed to drive operational awareness and an understanding of EHS issues. Intellectual Property Our business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, e-commerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business, including our expanding proprietary brands such as HDX  , Husky  , Hampton Bay  , Home Decorators Collection  , Glacier Bay  and Vigoro  . We also maintain patent portfolios relating to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our products or business operations. Seasonality Our business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, and the lowest volume occurs either during our first or fourth fiscal quarter. Available Information Our internet website is www.homedepot.com. We make available on the Investor Relations section of our website, free of charge, our Annual Reports to shareholders, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements, and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such documents with, or furnishing such documents to, the SEC. We include our website addresses throughout this report for reference only. The information contained on our websites is not incorporated by reference into this report. Other Financial Information For information on key financial highlights, including historical revenues, profits and total assets, see the \"Selected Financial Data\" on page F-1 of this report and Item 7, \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. In connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the SEC. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Should any of these risks materialize, our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted, which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities. You should read these Risk Factors in conjunction with \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8. Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. Our industry is highly competitive and evolving. As a result, we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, and service providers, ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online. The internet facilitates competitive entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the level of competition we face. In each of the markets we serve, there are a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO companies, home dcor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental. We compete, both in-store and online, primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, availability, product assortment, and delivery options. With respect to our stores, we also compete based on store location and appearance as well as presentation of merchandise. Our customers routinely use a variety of electronic devices and platforms to shop online, read product reviews, and compare prices, products, and delivery options, regardless of where or how they shop. Further, online and multichannel retailers are increasingly focusing on delivery services, with customers seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, including the success of our investments in One Home Depot Supply Chain, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. We use our marketing, advertising and promotional programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively, and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape. Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors, such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events, or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape, could adversely affect our prices, our margins, or demand for our products and services. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through the delivery of a superior customer experience or maintenance of effective marketing, advertising or promotional programs, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; consumer preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions or natural disasters, while also managing appropriate inventory levels in our stores and distribution or fulfillment centers and maintaining an excellent customer experience. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. In addition, each of our primary customer groups has different needs and expectations, many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change. We also need to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group. If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of  or within  a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers. Customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding. As noted above, customers routinely use technology and a variety of electronic devices and platforms to rapidly compare products and prices, determine real-time product availability, and purchase products. Once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products, and they often expect quick, timely, and low-price or free delivery. We must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. We have our BOSS, BOPIS, BODFS and direct fulfillment delivery options, but we cannot guarantee that these or future programs will be maintained and implemented successfully or that we will be able to meet customer expectations on delivery times, options and costs. Customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our Company and products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. To the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media, it may impact our brand and reputation. Further, we have an aging store base that requires maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. Our investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect. We must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates, as well as to protect against loss or theft of our inventory (also called \"shrink\"). Failure to improve and maintain our stores, utilize our store space effectively, and offer a safe shopping environment; to provide a compelling online presence; to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs and maintain appropriate inventory; to provide quick and low-price or free delivery alternatives; to differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups; and to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. The implementation of our store, interconnected retail, supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. We are substantially increasing our investments to create the One Home Depot experience, including significant investments over the next several years to build the One Home Depot Supply Chain. These initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high-quality service to our customers; simplify customer interactions; provide our customers with a more interconnected retail experience; and create the fastest, most efficient delivery network for home improvement products. Failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. The One Home Depot initiative will require significant investment in our operations and systems, as well as the development and execution of new processes, systems and support. If we are unable to effectively manage the volume and nature of these changes, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. The cost and potential problems, defects of design and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers, employing new web-based tools and services, implementing new technology, implementing and restructuring support systems and processes, and addressing impacts on inventory levels, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term, lead to product availability issues, and impact profitability. Further, accomplishing these initiatives will require a substantial investment in additional information technology personnel and other specialized personnel. We may face significant competition in the market for these resources and may not be successful in our hiring efforts. In addition, our store and interconnected retail initiatives, One Home Depot Supply Chain, and new or upgraded information technology systems might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs. Our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits. In addition, to support our strategic initiatives, including One Home Depot Supply Chain, and the related technology investments needed to implement our strategic investments, we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals, including technology professionals. The market for these professionals is increasingly competitive. An inability to provide wages and/or benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract associates. Further, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our labor costs. In addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. A failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data. In managing our business, we also rely heavily on the integrity of, security of, and consistent access to, this operational and financial data for information such as sales, customer data, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment and order fulfillment. For these information technology systems and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must maintain and update them. Our systems and the third-party systems with which we interact are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; security breaches; cyber-attacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing and denial of service attacks, and ransomware; catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, or hurricanes; acts of war or terrorism; and design or usage errors by our associates, contractors or third-party service providers. Although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, such efforts may not be successful. As a result, we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. Disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. Through our information technology systems, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected retail experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from a variety of electronic devices and platforms. We use our digital platforms both as sales channels for our products and also as methods of providing inspiration, as well as product, project, and other relevant information to our customers to drive sales, regardless of whether they occur in-store or online. We have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. The retail industry is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to new developments and changing customer preferences with respect to an interconnected experience. We continually seek to enhance all of our online properties to provide an attractive, user-friendly interface for our customers. Disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. Disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. A disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, or damage to our reputation. Such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers; weather-related events; natural disasters; trade policy changes or restrictions; tariffs or import-related taxes; third-party strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns; shipping capacity constraints; third-party contract disputes; supply or shipping interruptions or costs; military conflicts; acts of terrorism; or other factors beyond our control. Any such disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. If our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier and Company information are not successful, we could incur substantial costs and reputational damage and could become subject to litigation and enforcement actions. Our business, like that of most retailers, involves the receipt, storage, management and transmission of customers personal information, preferences, and payment card information, as well as other confidential information, such as personal information about our associates and our suppliers and confidential Company information. We also work with third-party service providers and vendors that provide technology, systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of this information. Our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and will continue to attempt to gain access to, these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third-party service providers or vendors. Hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. We have implemented and regularly review and update our systems, processes, and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss. However, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, as well as those of any companies we acquire. There is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data. As we experienced in connection with the data breach we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, any significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or Company data, could result in significant costs, including costs to investigate and remediate, as well as lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. In addition, the regulatory environment related to data privacy and cybersecurity is constantly changing, with new and increasingly rigorous requirements applicable to our business, and the implementation of these requirements has become more complex. Maintaining our compliance with those requirements may require significant effort and cost, and failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to fines, sanctions, governmental investigations, or lawsuits. We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability, and potentially disrupt our business. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, PayPal, our PLCCs, an installment loan program, trade credit, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. As a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Uncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions, political climate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance. Our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. Adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets, the economy or the political climate could adversely impact our customers confidence or financial condition, causing them to decide against purchasing home improvement products and services, causing them to delay purchasing decisions, or impacting their ability to pay for products and services. Other factors beyond our control  including unemployment and foreclosure rates; inventory loss due to theft; interest rate fluctuations; fuel and other energy costs; labor and healthcare costs; the availability of financing; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; weather; natural disasters; acts of terrorism; and other conditions beyond our control  could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance. Our business is subject to seasonal influences, and uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions, alone or together with natural disasters, could impact our operations. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tropical storms, fires, floods, tornadoes, and earthquakes; unseasonable, or unexpected or extreme weather conditions; or similar disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and confidence and consumers' disposable income, particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects, and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. These types of events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and other facilities. They can also, temporarily or on a long-term basis, disrupt or disable operations of stores, support centers, and portions of our supply chain and distribution network, including causing reductions in the availability of inventory and disruption of utility services. In addition, these events may affect our information systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders and to communicate with our stores. Unseasonable, unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as excessive precipitation, warm temperatures during the winter season, or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with customer needs. As a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events, we may experience interruption to our operations, increased costs, or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability. If we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. We buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing, as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by political instability, military conflict, acts of terrorism, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, any disruptions in our suppliers logistics or supply chain networks or information technology systems, and other factors beyond our or our suppliers control. If we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. As part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. We have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. Our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than national brand products, and represent a growing portion of our business. If we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results. Failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality and safety could damage our image with customers, expose us to litigation, and negatively impact our sales and results of operations. Product and service quality issues could negatively impact customer confidence in our brands and our Company. If our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers expectations regarding safety or quality, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks, as well as governmental enforcement actions. Actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns, including health-related concerns, could expose us to litigation, as well as government enforcement actions, and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. We seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our vendors. If we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available, such claims could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, our reputation as a provider of high quality products and services, including both national brand names and our proprietary products, could suffer, damaging our reputation and impacting customer loyalty. In addition, we and our customers have expectations around responsible sourcing. All of our vendors and service providers must comply with our responsible sourcing standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, sources of supply, and child and forced labor. We have a responsible sourcing audit process, but we are also dependent on our vendors and service providers to ensure that the products and services we provide comply with our standards. Our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks, including regulatory, product liability, supplier relations, and reputational risks. As we expand our proprietary product offerings, in addition to other product-related risks discussed herein, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. The risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and product recall exposure, and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. To effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our suppliers products, which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our suppliers. Any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we are unable to effectively manage our installation services business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits and reputational damage, or the loss of our general contractor licenses. We act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our DIFM customers through professional third-party installers. As such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of work performed by our third-party installers. We have established processes and procedures to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. However, if we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and governmental enforcement actions for violations of regulatory requirements, as well as for property damage or personal injury. In addition, we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could adversely affect our business. Our strategic transactions involve risks, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions. We regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, investments, alliances, and other growth and market expansion strategies, with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales, cost savings, synergies and various other benefits. Assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty. For each of our acquisitions, we need to successfully integrate the target companys products, services, associates and systems into our business operations. Integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. Furthermore, even if the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional liabilities. Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in a strategic transaction may reduce our earnings. Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. These laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; the classification of exempt and non-exempt employees; the distinction between employees and contractors; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; healthcare; data protection and cybersecurity; the sale and pricing of some of our products; transportation; logistics; international trade; supply chain transparency; taxes; unclaimed property; energy costs and consumption; or environmental matters, including with respect to our installation services business, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations. In fiscal 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Act, which significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. During fiscal 2018, additional guidance related to the Tax Act was issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS. The Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Department of the Treasury, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretations. Further, uncertainties also exist in terms of how U.S. states and foreign countries within which we operate will react to these U.S. federal income tax changes, which could have additional impacts on our effective tax rate. If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profitability may be negatively impacted. Our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our U.S. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. Our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations and other foreign legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political and economic conditions. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences; potential tariffs and other import-related taxes and controls; greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights; risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery law compliance; and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers. For example, there are growing concerns regarding trade relations between the U.S. and China, as both countries have indicated their intentions to impose significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories, as well as concerns related to the renegotiation of certain other trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement. As a significant portion of our retail products are sourced, directly or indirectly, outside of the U.S., major changes in tax or trade policies, tariffs or trade relations could adversely impact the cost of, demand for, and profitability of retail product sales in our U.S. locations. Other countries may also change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy and regulations. In addition, our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates, which may adversely impact our sales and profitability. The inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. Prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, tariffs and trade restrictions, and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance. We are predominantly self-insured for a number of different risk categories, such as general liability (including product liability), workers' compensation, employee group medical, automobile claims, and network security and privacy liability, with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. The occurrence of significant claims, a substantial rise in costs to maintain our insurance, or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. GAAP and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, vendor allowances, tax matters and litigation, are complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. The implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems, internal process and other changes that could increase our operating costs. We are involved in a number of legal, regulatory and governmental enforcement proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts or results. Additionally, involvement in these lawsuits, investigations and inquiries, and other proceedings may involve significant expense, divert managements attention and resources from other matters, and impact the reputation of the Company.

This new program does not have a prescribed expiration date. ##TABLE_END Sales of Unregistered Securities During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 , we issued 530 deferred stock units under the Home Depot, Inc. Nonemployee Directors Deferred Stock Compensation Plan pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of the SECs Regulation D thereunder. The deferred stock units were credited to the accounts of those non-employee directors who elected to receive all or a portion of board retainers in the form of deferred stock units instead of cash during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 . The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 , we credited 11,989 deferred stock units to participant accounts under the Restoration Plan pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for involuntary, non-contributory plans. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan. ", "6": " Item 6. Selected Financial Data.

Fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 include 52 weeks. We reported net sales of $108.2 billion in fiscal 2018 . Net earnings were $11.1 billion , or $9.73 per diluted share. The 53 rd week in fiscal 2018 added $1.7 billion of net sales and $241 million of net earnings and increased diluted earnings per share by $0.21. Our effective tax rate was 23.6% for fiscal 2018 and lower than fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 primarily due to enactment of the Tax Act. We opened two new stores in Mexico and one new store in the U.S. during fiscal 2018 , for a total store count of 2,287 at February 3, 2019 . At the end of fiscal 2018 , a total of 306 of our stores, or 13.4% , were located in Canada and Mexico. Total sales per square foot were $446.86 in fiscal 2018 , and our inventory turnover ratio was 5.1 times at the end of fiscal 2018 . We generated $13.0 billion of cash flow from operations during fiscal 2018 and issued $3.5 billion of long-term debt in fiscal 2018 . This cash flow, along with cash on hand, was used to fund cash payments of $10.0 billion for share repurchases, pay $4.7 billion of dividends, fund $2.4 billion in capital expenditures, repay $1.2 billion of senior notes that matured in September 2018, and repay $220 million of net short-term borrowings. During fiscal 2018 , we repurchased $10.0 billion of our common stock through ASR agreements and open market transactions. In February 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the December 2017 authorization, and we announced a 32% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.36 per share. Our ROIC was 44.8% for fiscal 2018 . See the \" Non-GAAP Financial Measures \" section below for our definition and calculation of ROIC, as well as a reconciliation of NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP financial measure). Results of Operations and Non-GAAP Measures The tables and discussion below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. We believe the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in our consolidated statements of earnings, as well as the percentage change in the associated dollar amounts, are relevant to an evaluation of our business. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal  Fiscal  Fiscal   dollars in millions $  % of Net Sales  $  % of Net Sales  $  % of Net Sales Net sales $ 108,203    $ 100,904    $ 94,595   Gross profit 37,160  34.3 %  34,356  34.0 %  32,313  34.2 % Operating expenses:            Selling, general and administrative 19,513  18.0  17,864  17.7  17,132  18.1 Depreciation and amortization 1,870  1.7  1,811  1.8  1,754  1.9 Impairment loss  0.2         Total operating expenses 21,630  20.0  19,675  19.5  18,886  20.0 Operating income 15,530  14.4  14,681  14.5  13,427  14.2 Interest and other (income) expense:            Interest and investment income (93 )  (0.1 )  (74 )  (0.1 )  (36 )   Interest expense 1,051  1.0  1,057  1.0   1.0 Other           Interest and other, net  0.9   1.0   1.0 Earnings before provision for income taxes 14,556  13.5  13,698  13.6  12,491  13.2 Provision for income taxes 3,435  3.2  5,068  5.0  4,534  4.8 Net earnings $ 11,121  10.3 %  $ 8,630  8.6 %  $ 7,957  8.4 % ##TABLE_END Note: Fiscal 2018 includes 53 weeks.

We assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales. Net Sales . Fiscal 2018 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2017. Net sales for fiscal 2018  increased  $7.3 billion , or 7.2% , to $108.2 billion . The increase in net sales in fiscal 2018 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by average ticket growth and increased customer transactions as well as $1.7 billion of net sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2018. Online sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 7.9% of net sales and grew 26.2% during fiscal 2018 . The adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 benefited net sales by $216 million in fiscal 2018, while the effect of foreign currency had a negligible impact on net sales. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on ASU No. 2014-09 and the implementation of this new standard for revenue recognition. Comparable Sales . Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable prior-period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excluding closed stores. Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 365 th day of operation. Acquisitions, digital or otherwise, are included in comparable sales after we own them for more than 52 weeks (with the exception of Interline which is excluded from comparable sales for periods prior to fiscal 2018). Net sales for the 53 rd week in a fiscal year are not included in the comparable sales calculation for that fiscal year. For example, our comparable sales results for fiscal 2018 compare weeks 1 through 52 in fiscal 2018 to the 52-week period reported for fiscal 2017. Comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. Total comparable sales increased  5.2% in fiscal 2018 . The increase in comparable sales reflected a number of factors, including the execution of our strategic efforts to drive an enhanced interconnected experience in both the physical and digital worlds. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales in fiscal 2018 except for Lighting , which was negative primarily due to LED price deflation. For fiscal 2018 , comparable sales for our Appliances, Tools, Electrical, Dcor, Plumbing, Lumber, and Indoor Garden merchandising departments were above the Company average. Our comparable average ticket increased 4.2% in fiscal 2018 while comparable customer transactions increased 1.0% during fiscal 2018 . The increase in comparable average ticket was due in large part to strong sales in big ticket purchases in certain categories, such as appliances and vinyl plank flooring. Gross Profit.  Gross profit increased  $2.8 billion , or 8.2% , to $37.2 billion in fiscal 2018 . Gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.3% in fiscal 2018 compared to 34.0% in fiscal 2017 . The increase in gross profit margin for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by a $598 million benefit from the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 and a benefit from mix of products sold, partially offset by higher transportation and fuel costs in our supply chain and shrink. The additional week in fiscal 2018 contributed $615 million to gross profit. Operating Expenses. Our operating expenses are composed of SGA, depreciation and amortization, and impairment loss. Selling, General  Administrative .  SGA increased  $1.6 billion , or 9.2% , to $19.5 billion in fiscal 2018 . As a percent of net sales, SGA was 18.0% for fiscal 2018 compared to 17.7% for fiscal 2017 . The increase in SGA as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2018 reflected an increase of $598 million from the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 and $544 million of incremental investments made in the business, partially offset by expense leverage resulting from the positive sales environment and continued expense control. The additional week in fiscal 2018 contributed $301 million to SGA. Depreciation and Amortization .  Depreciation and amortization increased  $59 million , or 3.3% , in fiscal 2018 . As a percent of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 1.7% for fiscal 2018 compared to 1.8% in fiscal 2017 . The decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales reflected expense leverage resulting from the positive sales environment and the timing of asset additions, partially offset by $136 million of incremental depreciation stemming from investments in the business. The additional week in fiscal 2018 did not result in incremental expense because we recognize depreciation and amortization expense on a monthly basis. Impairment Loss . We recognized a $247 million impairment loss in fiscal 2018 related to certain trade names associated with Interline.  See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for more information. Interest and Other, net.  Interest and other, net, was $974 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $983 million for fiscal 2017 . Interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales decreased to 0.9% in fiscal 2018 from 1.0% in fiscal 2017 , primarily reflecting sales leverage resulting from the positive sales environment, decreased tax reserves due to certain positive audit settlements, and higher interest income, partially offset by higher interest expense on long-term debt balances in fiscal 2018 and a loss on the sale of a non-strategic asset. Provision for Income Taxes.  Our combined effective income tax rate was 23.6% for fiscal 2018 compared to 37.0% for fiscal 2017 . The decrease in the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2018 primarily reflected the enactment of the Tax Act and adjustments to the provisional tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as well as certain positive audit settlements. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Diluted Earnings per Share.  Diluted earnings per share were $9.73 for fiscal 2018 compared to $7.29 for fiscal 2017 . Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018  reflected a benefit of $1.48 per share resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act, a benefit of $0.21 per share for the 53 rd week, and a decrease of $0.16 per share due to the impairment loss. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 included a benefit of $0.09 per share as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, which requires that we recognize tax benefits or deficiencies related to share-based payment awards in the provision for income taxes. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 also reflected decreases of $0.11 per share due to the net tax charge recorded in connection with the enactment of the Tax Act and $0.06 per share due to the one-time bonus payment to hourly associates made as a result of the Tax Act. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016  Sales.  Net Sales . Net sales for fiscal 2017 increased $6.3 billion, or 6.7%, to $100.9 billion. The increase in net sales in fiscal 2017 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth. Hurricane-related sales contributed approximately $662 million to net sales in the second half of fiscal 2017. Comparable Sales . Total comparable sales increased 6.8% in fiscal 2017. The increase in comparable sales reflected a number of factors, including the execution of our strategy and broad-based growth across our stores and online. Online sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 6.7% of net sales and grew 21.5% during fiscal 2017. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales except for one, which was flat in fiscal 2017. Comparable sales for our Lumber, Electrical, Tools, Appliances, Flooring, Building Materials, and Indoor Garden merchandising departments were above the Company average during fiscal 2017. Our comparable customer transactions increased 2.2% during fiscal 2017. Further, our comparable average ticket increased 4.5% in fiscal 2017, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases in certain merchandising departments, such as Appliances and Flooring. Gross Profit.  Gross profit increased $2.0 billion, or 6.3%, to $34.4 billion in fiscal 2017. Gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.0% in fiscal 2017 compared to 34.2% in fiscal 2016. The modest decline in gross profit margin for fiscal 2017 reflected the impact of lower margin hurricane-related sales and higher shrink, partially offset by benefits from our supply chain. Operating Expenses. Selling, General  Administrative .  SGA increased $732 million, or 4.3%, to $17.9 billion in fiscal 2017 and included approximately $170 million of hurricane-related expenses. As a percent of net sales, SGA was 17.7% for fiscal 2017 compared to 18.1% for fiscal 2016. The decrease in SGA as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2017 reflected expense leverage resulting from the positive sales environment and continued expense control. Depreciation and Amortization .  Depreciation and amortization increased $57 million, or 3.2%, in fiscal 2017. The decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales to 1.8% in fiscal 2017 from 1.9% in fiscal 2016 reflected expense leverage resulting from the positive sales environment. Interest and Other, net.  Interest and other, net, was $983 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $936 million for fiscal 2016. Interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 1.0% for both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 and reflected additional interest expense in fiscal 2017 resulting from higher long-term debt balances in fiscal 2017, offset by higher interest income in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Provision for Income Taxes.  Our combined effective income tax rate was 37.0% for fiscal 2017 compared to 36.3% for fiscal 2016. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 reflected a net $127 million charge resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 also reflected a $106 million benefit to our provision for income taxes for share-based payment awards as a result of our adoption of ASU No. 2016-09. Diluted Earnings per Share.  Diluted earnings per share were $7.29 for fiscal 2017 compared to $6.45 for fiscal 2016. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 included a benefit of $0.09 per share as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, as well as decreases of $0.11 per share due to the net tax charge recorded in connection with the enactment of the Tax Act and $0.06 per share due to the one-time bonus payment to hourly associates made as a result of the Tax Act. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-GAAP financial measures. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies. Return on Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. We define ROIC as NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by average debt and equity. We define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period. The calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure), follows. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal  Fiscal  Fiscal dollars in millions   Net earnings $ 11,121  $ 8,630  $ 7,957 Interest and other, net   Provision for income taxes 3,435  5,068  4,534 Operating income 15,530  14,681  13,427 Income tax adjustment (1) (3,665 )  (5,432 )  (4,874 ) NOPAT $ 11,865  $ 9,249  $ 8,553       Average debt and equity (2) $ 26,492  $ 27,074  $ 27,203       ROIC 44.8 %  34.2 %  31.4 % ##TABLE_END Note: Fiscal 2018 includes 53 weeks. Fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 include 52 weeks. ##TABLE_START (1) Income tax adjustment is defined as operating income multiplied by our effective tax rate for the trailing twelve months. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) The beginning balance of equity for fiscal 2018 has been adjusted to reflect an opening balance sheet adjustment of $75 million due to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, in fiscal 2018. ##TABLE_ENDLiquidity and Capital Resources Cash and Cash Equivalents at End of Year At February 3, 2019 , we had $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1.4 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our current cash position, access to the long-term debt capital markets, funds available from our commercial paper programs, and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases, and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. As we accelerate our investments in the business, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $2.7 billion in fiscal 2019. Debt and Derivatives We have commercial paper programs with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $3.0 billion . All of our short-term borrowings in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were under these commercial paper programs. In connection with these programs, we have back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $3.0 billion , which consist of a five-year $2.0 billion credit facility and a 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility. In December 2018, we completed the renewal of our 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility, extending the maturity from December 2018 to December 2019. In December 2017, we replaced our five-year $2.0 billion credit facility that was scheduled to expire in December 2019 , with a new, substantially identical five-year $2.0 billion credit facility that expires in December 2022 . At February 3, 2019 , we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the credit facilities, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. At February 3, 2019 , there were $1.3 billion of borrowings outstanding under these commercial paper programs compared to $1.6 billion at January 28, 2018 . We also issue senior notes from time to time and use derivative financial instruments in the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rates on certain long-term debt. See Note 4 and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt and derivative agreements. Leases We use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers, and store support centers. See Note 3 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our capital and operating leases. Share Repurchases In fiscal 2018 , we repurchased $10.0 billion of our common stock through open market transactions and ASR agreements. In December 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a $15.0 billion share repurchase program, of which approximately $2.9 billion remained at the end of fiscal 2018. In February 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous authorization. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our share repurchases. Cash Flows Summary Operating Activities. Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, operations and occupancy costs. Cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Net cash provided by operating activities increased  $1.0 billion in fiscal 2018 and increased  $2.2 billion in fiscal 2017 . The increase in fiscal 2018 primarily reflected an increase in net earnings, partially offset by net cash outflows associated with changes in working capital. The increase in net earnings during fiscal 2018 was primarily due to a lower effective income tax rate in fiscal 2018 resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act and higher comparable sales. The increase in fiscal 2017 primarily reflected an increase in net earnings and net cash inflows associated with changes in working capital. The increase in earnings in fiscal 2017 resulted from higher comparable sales and expense leverage. Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities primarily reflected: ##TABLE_START  $2.4 billion of capital expenditures for investments in our business in fiscal 2018 ; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $1.9 billion of capital expenditures for investments in our business and $374 million cash paid in connection with the acquisitions of Compact Power Equipment, Inc. and The Company Store in fiscal 2017 ; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $1.6 billion of capital expenditures for investments in our business in fiscal 2016 . ##TABLE_END Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities primarily reflected: ##TABLE_START  $10.0 billion of share repurchases and $4.7 billion of cash dividends paid, partially offset by $2.0 billion of net proceeds from short- and long-term debt in fiscal 2018 ; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $8.0 billion of share repurchases and $4.2 billion of cash dividends paid, partially offset by $3.3 billion of net proceeds from short- and long-term debt in fiscal 2017 ; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $6.9 billion of share repurchases and $3.4 billion of cash dividends paid, partially offset by $2.3 billion of net proceeds from short- and long-term debt in fiscal 2016 . ##TABLE_END Contractual Obligations Our significant contractual obligations at February 3, 2019 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Payments Due by Period in millions Total  Less than 1 Year  1 to 3 Years  3 to 5 Years  More Than 5 Years Short-term debt $ 1,339  $ 1,339  $   $   $  Long-term debt  principal payments (1) 27,100  1,000  4,100  3,250  18,750 Long-term debt  interest payments (2) 16,768  1,022  1,913  1,664  12,169 Capital lease obligations (3) 1,709     Operating lease obligations 7,036   1,704  1,266  3,090 Purchase obligations (4) 1,601  1,080    Unrecognized tax benefits (5)        Total $ 55,618  $ 5,632  $ 8,329  $ 6,641  $ 35,016 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Excludes capital lease obligations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Interest payments are calculated at current interest rates, including the impact of active interest rate swaps. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Includes $660 million of imputed interest. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, software acquisitions and license commitments, and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) Excludes $429 million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash tax payments. ##TABLE_END Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates. Merchandise Inventories We value the substantial majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method, using the first-in, first-out method, with the remainder of our inventories valued under a cost method. Under the retail inventory method, inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. The retail value of our inventory is adjusted as needed to reflect current market conditions. Because these adjustments are based on current prevailing market conditions, the value of our inventory approximates the lower of cost or market. As the valuation under the retail inventory method is based on estimates such as markups, markdowns, and inventory losses (or shrink), there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross profit. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood for a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to value our inventory under the retail inventory method. We believe that the retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which approximates cost and results in valuing our inventory at the lower of cost or market. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing its undiscounted future cash flows with its carrying value. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition, and inflation. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows, we then measure the assets fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. If the resulting fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized. We generally base our estimates of fair market value on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates of the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations. Impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2018 . Self-Insurance We have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability (including product liability), workers compensation, employee group medical, and automobile claims for which we are self-insured. Our self-insured retention or deductible, as applicable, for each claim involving general liability, workers compensation, and automobile liability is limited to $25 million, $1 million, and $1 million, respectively. We have no stop loss limits for self-insured employee group medical claims. Our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred at the balance sheet date. The estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. The liabilities are reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2018 , fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016 . Revenues We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or when a service is performed. We estimate the liability for sales returns, including the estimated gross profit impact, based on our historical return levels and believe that our estimate for sales returns is a reasonable reflection of future returns. In connection with the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, we also recognize a return asset, and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales, for our right to recover the goods returned by the customer, measured at the former carrying amount of the goods, less any expected recovery cost. At each financial reporting date, we assess our estimates of expected returns, refund liabilities, and return assets. We defer revenue and the related gross profit for payments received from customers for which the customer has not yet taken possession of merchandise or we have not yet performed the service for the customer. This amount is recorded as deferred revenue. We estimate the gross profit related to deferred revenue using historical rates, which we believe to be a reasonable reflection of future rates. If these estimates significantly differ from actual amounts, our net sales and gross profit could be impacted. Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and co-op advertising allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. We believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors. Volume rebates and certain co-op advertising allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold. Certain co-op advertising allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in SGA. Additional Information For information on accounting pronouncements that have impacted or are expected to materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. ", "7A": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk. We have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our long-term debt portfolio. We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. At February 3, 2019 , after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, floating rate debt principal was $2.1 billion , or approximately 8% of our long-term debt portfolio. A 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The United Kingdoms Financial Conduct Authority has announced the intent to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. If LIBOR is discontinued, we may need to renegotiate the terms of certain of our floating rate notes, interest rate swap agreements, and credit instruments, which utilize LIBOR as a benchmark in determining the interest rate, to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. As a result, we may incur incremental costs in transitioning to a new standard, and interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected by the new standard. There is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined, but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.  We are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. Revenues from these foreign operations accounted for approximately $ 8.8 billion of our revenue for fiscal 2018 . Our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. Commodity Price Risk.  We have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ##TABLE_END Business The Home Depot, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (the \"Company,\" \"Home Depot,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\"), is a home improvement retailer that sells a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, and dcor items and provides a number of services, in stores and online. We operate in the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico. Consolidation and Presentation Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform with the presentation adopted in the current fiscal year. Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31. Fiscal 2018  includes 53 weeks compared to fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 , both of which include 52 weeks. Use of Estimates We have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses in preparing these financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents are carried at fair market value and consist primarily of money market funds. Receivables The components of receivables, net, follow. ##TABLE_START in millions February 3, 2019  January 28, 2018 Card receivables $  $ Rebate receivables  Customer receivables  Other receivables  Receivables, net $ 1,936  $ 1,952 ##TABLE_ENDCard receivables consist of payments due from financial institutions for the settlement of credit card and debit card transactions. Rebate receivables represent amounts due from vendors for volume and co-op advertising rebates. Receivables due from customers relate to credit extended directly to certain customers in the ordinary course of business. The valuation reserve related to accounts receivable was not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017 . Merchandise Inventories The majority of our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, as determined by the retail inventory method. As the inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, the inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Certain subsidiaries, including retail operations in Canada and Mexico, and distribution centers, record merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, as determined by a cost method. These merchandise inventories represent approximately 29% of the total merchandise inventories balance. We evaluate the inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017 . Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in merchandise inventories are properly stated. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, \"swell\") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. We calculate shrink based on actual inventory losses occurring as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses occurring between physical inventory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Property and Equipment, including Capitalized Lease Assets Buildings, furniture, fixtures, and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the original term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment follow. ##TABLE_START  Life Buildings 5  45 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 2  20 years Leasehold improvements 5  45 years ##TABLE_ENDWe capitalize certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortize these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to six years . Certain development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred. We evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing its undiscounted future cash flows with its carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows, we then measure the assets fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. If the resulting fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value. Impairment losses on property and equipment are recorded as a component of SGA. When a leased location closes, we also recognize, in SGA, the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. Impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2018 , fiscal 2017 , or fiscal 2016 . Leases We categorize leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. Lease agreements include certain retail locations, office space, warehouse and distribution space, equipment, and vehicles. Most of these leases are operating leases. However, certain retail locations and equipment are leased under capital leases. Short-term and long-term obligations for capital leases are included in the applicable long-term debt category based on maturity. We expense rent related to operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term, which commences on the date we have the right to control the property. The cumulative expense recognized on a straight-line basis in excess of the cumulative payments is included in other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. Total rent expense for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016 is net of an immaterial amount of sublease income. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill, but assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. Each fiscal year, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments, with a quantitative assessment completed at least once every three years . We completed our last quantitative assessment in fiscal 2016 . In fiscal 2018 , we completed our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for the U.S., Canada, and Mexico reporting units. We performed qualitative assessments, concluding that the fair value of the reporting units substantially exceeded the respective reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill. As a result, there were no impairment charges related to goodwill for fiscal 2018 , fiscal 2017 , or fiscal 2016 . Changes in the carrying amount of our goodwill follow. ##TABLE_START in millions Fiscal  Fiscal  Fiscal   Goodwill, balance at beginning of year $ 2,275  $ 2,093  $ 2,102 Acquisitions (1)    Disposition (15 )     Other (2) (12 )   (9 ) Goodwill, balance at end of year $ 2,252  $ 2,275  $ 2,093 ##TABLE_END (1) Includes purchase price allocation adjustments. (2) Primarily reflects the impact of foreign currency translation. Other Intangible Assets We amortize the cost of other finite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 12 years . Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. Intangible assets other than goodwill are included in other assets. In January 2019, we recognized a pretax impairment loss of $247 million for certain trade names as a result of a shift in strategy for our MRO business. Our remaining finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangibles were not material at February 3, 2019 . Debt We record any premiums or discounts associated with an issuance of long-term debt as a direct addition or deduction to the carrying value of the related senior notes. We also record debt issuance costs associated with an issuance of long-term debt as a direct deduction to the carrying value of the related senior notes. Premium, discount, and debt issuance costs are amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest rate method. Derivatives We use derivative financial instruments in the management of our interest rate exposure on long-term debt and our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. For derivatives that are designated as hedges, changes in their fair values that are considered effective are either accounted for in earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income or loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings, depending on the nature of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of a derivatives change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. Financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings. All qualifying derivative financial instruments are recognized at their fair values in either assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date and are reported on a gross basis. The fair values of our derivative financial instruments are discussed in Note 4 and Note 7 . Insurance We are self-insured for certain losses related to general liability (including product liability), workers compensation, employee group medical, and automobile claims. We recognize the expected ultimate cost for claims incurred (undiscounted) at the balance sheet date as a liability. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred is estimated based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. We also maintain network security and privacy liability insurance coverage to limit our exposure to losses such as those that may be caused by a significant compromise or breach of our data security. Insurance-related expenses are included in SGA. Treasury Stock Treasury stock is reflected as a reduction of stockholders' equity at cost. We use the weighted-average purchase cost to determine the cost of treasury stock that is reissued, if any. Net Sales On January 29, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09 using the modified retrospective transition method which requires that we recognize revenue differently pre- and post-adoption. See \"Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsASU No. 2014-09\" below for more information. Fiscal 2018 and Subsequent Periods. We recognize revenue, net of expected returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or when a service is performed. The liability for sales returns, including the impact to gross profit, is estimated based on historical return levels and recognized at the transaction price. We also recognize a return asset, and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales, for our right to recover the goods returned by the customer, measured at the former carrying amount of the goods, less any expected recovery cost. At each financial reporting date, we assess our estimates of expected returns, refund liabilities, and return assets. Net sales include services revenue generated through a variety of installation, home maintenance, and professional service programs. In these programs, the customer selects and purchases material for a project, and we provide or arrange for professional installation. These programs are offered through our stores and in-home sales programs. Under certain programs, when we provide or arrange for the installation of a project and the subcontractor provides material as part of the installation, both the material and labor are included in services revenue. We recognize this revenue when the service for the customer is complete, which is not materially different from recognizing the revenue over the service period as the substantial majority of our services are completed within one week. For product sold in stores or online, payment is typically due at the point of sale. For services, payment in full is due upon completion of the job. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the sale or service is complete. Such performance obligations are part of contracts with expected original durations of three months or less. We further record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize the associated revenue upon the redemption of those gift cards in net sales. Gift card breakage income, which is our estimate of the non-redeemed gift card balance, was immaterial in fiscal 2018. We also have agreements with third-party service providers who directly extend credit to customers and manage our PLCC program. Deferred interest charges incurred for our deferred financing programs offered to these customers, interchange fees charged to us for their use of the cards, and any profit sharing with the third-party service providers are included in net sales. Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016. We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or when a service is performed. The liability for sales returns, including the impact to gross profit, is estimated based on historical return levels. Net sales include services revenue generated through a variety of installation, home maintenance, and professional service programs. In these programs, the customer selects and purchases material for a project, and we provide or arrange professional installation. These programs are offered through our stores and in-home sales programs. Under certain programs, when we provide or arrange the installation of a project and the subcontractor provides material as part of the installation, both the material and labor are included in services revenue. We recognize this revenue when the service for the customer is complete. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the sale or service is complete. We also record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in net sales. Gift card breakage income, which is our estimate of the non-redeemed gift card balance, was immaterial in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed; the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to our distribution network, stores, or customers; shipping and handling costs from our stores or distribution network to customers; and the operating cost and depreciation of our sourcing and distribution network and online fulfillment centers. In fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, cost of sales also included cost of deferred interest programs offered through our PLCC programs. Cost of Credit We have agreements with third-party service providers who directly extend credit to customers, manage our PLCC program, and own the related receivables. We have evaluated the third-party entities holding the receivables under the program and concluded that they should not be consolidated. The agreement with the primary third-party service provider for our PLCC program expires in 2028 , with us having the option, but no obligation, to purchase the receivables at the end of the agreement. The deferred interest charges we incur for our deferred financing programs offered to our customers are included in net sales in fiscal 2018 and subsequent periods and in cost of sales in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. The interchange fees charged to us for our customers use of the cards and any profit sharing with the third-party service providers are included in net sales in fiscal 2018 and subsequent periods and in SGA in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. The sum of the deferred interest charges, interchange fees, and any profit sharing is referred to as the cost of credit of the PLCC program. Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and co-op advertising allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and certain co-op advertising allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold. Certain other co-op advertising allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in SGA. The co-op advertising allowances recorded as an offset to advertising expense follow. ##TABLE_START in millions Fiscal  Fiscal  Fiscal   Specific, incremental, and identifiable co-op advertising allowances $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDAdvertising Expense Television and radio advertising production costs, along with media placement costs, are expensed when the advertisement first appears. Certain co-op advertising allowances are recorded as an offset against advertising expense. Gross advertising expense included in SGA follows. ##TABLE_START in millions Fiscal  Fiscal  Fiscal   Gross advertising expense $ 1,156  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDStock-Based Compensation We are currently authorized to issue incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, and deferred shares to certain of our associates, officers, and directors under certain stock incentive plans. We measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to associates and directors based on estimated fair values. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period or as restrictions lapse. Additional information on our stock-based payment awards is included in Note 8 . Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. We provide for federal, state, and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as for those deferred due to timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return which includes certain eligible subsidiaries. Non-U.S. subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, are not eligible to be included in our consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Separate provisions for income taxes have been determined for these entities. For unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, we are required to make an assertion regarding reinvestment or repatriation for tax purposes. For any earnings that we do not make a permanent reinvestment assertion, we recognize a provision for deferred income taxes. For earnings where we have made a permanent reinvestment assertion, no provision is recognized. See Note 5 for further discussion. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income includes net earnings adjusted for certain gains and losses that are excluded from net earnings under GAAP, which consists primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates for the period and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the day of the transaction. Reclassifications Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current periods financial statement presentation. See \"Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\" below for a discussion of our adoption of new accounting standards. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements ASU No. 2016-16.  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory,\" which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intercompany transfer of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs. An entity will continue to recognize the income tax consequences of an intercompany transfer of inventory when the inventory is sold to a third party. On January 29, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2016-16 using the modified retrospective transition method with no impact on our consolidated financial statements. We expect the impact of the adoption to be immaterial to our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows on an ongoing basis. ASU No. 2014-09.  In May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\" revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. On January 29, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09 using the modified retrospective transition method. In preparation for implementation of the standard, we finalized key accounting assessments and then implemented internal controls and updated processes to appropriately recognize and present the associated financial information. Based on these efforts, we determined that the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 changes the presentation of (i) certain expenses and cost reimbursements associated with our PLCC program (now recognized in net sales), (ii) certain expenses related to the sale of gift cards to customers (now recognized in operating expense), and (iii) gift card breakage income (now recognized in net sales). We also have changed our recognition of gift card breakage income to be recognized proportionately as redemption occurs, rather than based on historical redemption patterns. In addition, the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 requires that we recognize our sales return allowance on a gross basis rather than as a net liability. As such, we now recognize (i) a return asset for the right to recover the goods returned by the customer, measured at the former carrying amount of the goods, less any expected recovery costs (recorded as an increase to other current assets) and (ii) a return liability for the amount of expected returns (recorded as an increase to other accrued expenses and a decrease to receivables, net). We applied ASU No. 2014-09 only to contracts that were not completed prior to fiscal 2018. The cumulative effect of initially applying ASU No. 2014-09 was a $99 million reduction to deferred revenue, a $24 million increase to deferred income taxes (included in other long-term liabilities), and a $75 million increase to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 29, 2018. The comparative prior period information continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect during those periods. We expect the impact of the adoption to be immaterial to our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows on an ongoing basis. Excluding the effect of the opening balance sheet adjustment noted above, the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 on our consolidated balance sheet as of February 3, 2019 follows. ##TABLE_START in millions As Reported  ASU No. 2014-09 Impact  Excluding ASU No. 2014-09 Impact Receivables, net $ 1,936  $ (40 )  $ 1,976 Other current assets   Other accrued expenses 2,611   2,395 ##TABLE_ENDThe impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 on our consolidated statements of earnings for fiscal 2018 follows. ##TABLE_START in millions As Reported  ASU No. 2014-09 Impact  Excluding ASU No. 2014-09 Impact Net sales $ 108,203  $  $ 107,987 Cost of sales 71,043  (382 )  71,425 Gross profit 37,160   36,562 Selling, general and administrative 19,513   18,915 ##TABLE_ENDRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements ASU No. 2018-15. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, \"Intangibles  Goodwill and Other  Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract,\" which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. ASU No. 2018-15 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2018-15 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. ASU No. 2018-02. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, \"Income Statement  Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income,\" which allows for an optional reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects as a result of the Tax Act. ASU No. 2018-02 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and early adoption is permitted. Two transition methods are available: at the beginning of the period of adoption, or retrospective to each period in which the income tax effects of the Tax Act related to items remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized. We will adopt this standard in the first quarter of 2019, applying the adjustment at the beginning of the period of adoption. We have evaluated the effect that ASU No. 2018-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and noted no material impact. ASU No. 2017-12. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, \"Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities,\" which amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements. ASU No. 2017-12 eliminates the concept of recognizing periodic hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow and net investment hedges and allows an entity to apply the shortcut method to partial-term fair value hedges of interest rate risk. ASU No. 2017-12 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted in any interim period after issuance of this update. We have evaluated the effect that ASU No. 2017-12 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and noted no material impact. ASU No. 2017-04. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, \"IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\" which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment. The amendments in ASU No. 2017-04 require goodwill impairment to be measured using the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit and require the loss recognized to not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU No. 2017-04 should be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for our annual goodwill impairment tests beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted. We have evaluated the effect that ASU No. 2017-04 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and noted no material impact. ASU No. 2016-02. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842),\" which establishes a right-of-use model and requires an entity that is a lessee to recognize the right-of-use assets and liabilities arising from leases on its balance sheet. ASU No. 2016-02 also requires disclosures about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement. This new standard is effective for us on February 4, 2019 (the effective date). ASU No. 2016-02 was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2018-01, \"Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842\"; ASU No. 2018-10, \"Codification Improvements to Topic 842\"; and ASU No. 2018-11, \"Targeted Improvements\". ASU 2016-02 and relevant updates require a modified retrospective transition, with the cumulative effect of transition, including initial recognition of lease assets and liabilities for existing operating leases as of (i) the effective date or (ii) the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. These updates also provide a number of practical expedients for transition and implementation that will be elected. We will adopt this standard using the modified retrospective method with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the effective date. We plan to elect the package of practical expedients in transition, which permits us to not reassess our prior conclusions pertaining to lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs on leases that commenced prior to our adoption of the new standard. We do not expect to elect the use-of-hindsight or land easements transition practical expedients. Additionally, we will elect ongoing practical expedients including the option to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities related to leases with an original term of twelve months or less. We believe that ASU 2016-02 will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of the requirement to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for our operating leases upon adoption. We estimate total assets and liabilities will increase approximately $6 billion upon adoption. This estimate may change as the implementation is finalized as a result of changes to our lease portfolio prior to adoption. We do not believe that there will be a material impact to our results of operations, stockholders equity, or cash flows upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-02. We reviewed and selected a new lease accounting system and are currently accumulating and processing lease data into the system. We are continuing to evaluate our internal control framework, including implementing changes to our processes, controls, and systems in connection therewith, to determine any necessary changes upon adoption of ASU 2016-02. Recent accounting pronouncements pending adoption not discussed above are either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on us. ##TABLE_START 2.

All of our senior notes, other than our outstanding floating rate notes, may be redeemed by us at any time, in whole or in part, at the redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. With respect to the 2020 notes and the 2022 notes, the redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes to be redeemed that would be due after the related redemption date. With respect to all other notes, the redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the Par Call Date, as defined in the respective notes. Additionally, if a Change in Control Triggering Event occurs, as defined in the notes, holders of all notes have the right to require us to redeem those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. We are generally not limited under the indentures governing the notes in our ability to incur additional indebtedness or required to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing the notes contain various customary covenants; however, none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. Maturities of Long-Term Debt. Our long-term debt maturities, excluding capital leases, follow. ##TABLE_START in millions Principal Fiscal 2019 $ 1,000 Fiscal 2020 1,750 Fiscal 2021 2,350 Fiscal 2022 2,250 Fiscal 2023 1,000 Thereafter 18,750 ##TABLE_ENDDerivative Instruments We had outstanding cross currency swap agreements with a combined notional amount of $326 million at February 3, 2019 and $626 million at January 28, 2018 , accounted for as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency fluctuations on certain intercompany debt. The approximate fair values of these agreements were assets of $121 million at February 3, 2019 and $233 million at January 28, 2018 , which were the estimated amounts we would have received to settle the agreements and were included in other assets. We had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with combined notional amounts of $1.3 billion at both February 3, 2019 and January 28, 2018 . These agreements were accounted for as fair value hedges that swap fixed for variable rate interest to hedge changes in the fair values of certain senior notes. The fair values of these agreements were not material at February 3, 2019 and January 28, 2018 . We had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with a combined notional amount of $16 million at February 3, 2019 . These agreements were accounted for as cash flow hedges that hedge the variability of forecasted cash flow associated with certain payments made in our foreign operations. At January 28, 2018 , we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with a combined notional amount of $300 million . These agreements were accounted for as net investment hedges that hedge against foreign currency exposure on our net investment in certain subsidiaries and were all settled during fiscal 2018 . At February 3, 2019 and January 28, 2018 , the fair values of these agreements were not material. ##TABLE_START 5. INCOME TAXES ##TABLE_END Tax Reform On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted comprehensive tax legislation with the Tax Act, making broad and complex changes to U.S. tax law, including lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21%, transitioning to a modified territorial system, and providing for current expensing of certain qualifying capital expenditures. Also in December 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") to address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. As disclosed in our 2017 Form 10-K, we were able to reasonably estimate certain effects and, therefore, recorded a total provisional charge of $127 million . The provisional charge included (i) a charge for the deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries, (ii) a provisional benefit for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and (iii) an estimated benefit due to a lower U.S. statutory tax rate. As of February 3, 2019, we have completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Act. During fiscal 2018, we adjusted the provisional charge by a net benefit of $85 million , for a final tax charge of $42 million . These adjustments were made upon our further analysis of certain aspects of the Tax Act, refinement of our calculations, and the issuance of guidance by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The components of the provisional charge recognized in fiscal 2017 and the adjustments made during fiscal 2018 follow. ##TABLE_START in millions Deemed Repatriation  Deferred Tax Remeasure-ment  Statutory Tax Rate Impact  Total Provisional tax charge (benefit) - recognized in fiscal 2017 $  $ (147 )  $ (126 )  $ Tax charge (benefit) adjustment - finalized in fiscal 2018 (62 )  (22 )  (1 )  (85 ) Total tax charge (benefit) $  $ (169 )  $ (127 )  $ ##TABLE_ENDWe have elected to pay our transition tax over the eight-year period provided in the Tax Act. As of February 3, 2019, the remaining balance of our transition tax obligation was $14 million , after required application of overpayments. The Tax Act also created a new requirement that certain income (referred to as global intangible low-taxed income or GILTI) earned by controlled foreign corporations, or CFCs, must be included currently in the gross income of the CFCs U.S. shareholder. Due to the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, we recorded no GILTI related deferred taxes as of January 28, 2018. After further considerations in fiscal 2018, we have elected to account for GILTI in the period the tax is incurred. We expect additional regulatory guidance and technical clarifications from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS within the next 12 months. Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to the provision for income taxes in the period in which the guidance is issued or finalized.

At February 3, 2019 , we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, expiring at various dates beginning in 2019 to 2038 . We have concluded that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits related to the federal, state, and foreign net operating losses will be realized. Reinvestment of Unremitted Earnings Substantially all of our current year foreign cash flows in excess of working capital and cash needed for strategic investments are not intended to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. Therefore, the tax effects of repatriation (including applicable state and local taxes and foreign withholding taxes) of such cash flows have been provided for in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. We intend to reinvest substantially all of the approximately $3 billion of non-cash unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries indefinitely. Accordingly, no provision for state and local taxes or foreign withholding taxes was recorded on these unremitted earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. It is impracticable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on these indefinitely reinvested earnings due to the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation. Tax Return Examination Status Our income tax returns are routinely examined by U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign tax authorities. With few exceptions, as of February 3, 2019, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2018, the Company settled a transfer pricing issue between the U.S. and Mexican tax authorities. The resolution of this issue reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $89 million . The net impact of the settlement resulted in an immaterial tax charge in fiscal 2018. Our U.S. federal tax returns for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 are currently under examination by the IRS. With respect to these years, the IRS has issued a proposed adjustment relating to transfer pricing between our entities in the U.S. and China. We intend to defend our position using all available remedies including bi-lateral relief. There are also ongoing U.S. state and local audits and other foreign audits covering fiscal years 2005 through 2017 . We do not expect the results from any ongoing income tax audit to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Over the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the resolution of federal and state tax examinations could reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by $65 million . Final settlement of these audit issues may result in payments that are more or less than this amount, but we do not anticipate the resolution of these matters will result in a material change to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Interest and Penalties Net adjustments to accruals for interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions resulted in a benefit of $33 million in fiscal 2018 , and expenses of $24 million in fiscal 2017 and $20 million in fiscal 2016 .

We enter into ASR agreements from time to time with third-party financial institutions to repurchase shares of our common stock. Under an ASR agreement, we pay a specified amount to the financial institution and receive an initial delivery of shares. This initial delivery of shares represents the minimum number of shares that we may receive under the agreement. Upon settlement of the ASR agreement, the financial institution delivers additional shares, with the final number of shares delivered determined with reference to the volume weighted average price per share of our common stock over the term of the agreement, less a negotiated discount. The transactions are accounted for as equity transactions and are included in treasury stock when the shares are received, at which time there is an immediate reduction in the weighted average common shares calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ##TABLE_END The fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties. A liabilitys fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, rather than the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ##TABLE_END Omnibus Stock Incentive Plans The Home Depot, Inc. Amended and Restated 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2005 Plan\") and The Home Depot, Inc. 1997 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the \"1997 Plan\" and collectively with the 2005 Plan, the \"Plans\") provide that incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, deferred shares, and other stock-based awards may be issued to certain of our associates, officers, and non-employee directors. Under the 2005 Plan, the maximum number of shares of our common stock authorized for issuance is 255 million shares, with any award other than a stock option or stock appreciation right reducing the number of shares available for issuance by 2.11 shares. At February 3, 2019 , there were 127 million shares available for future grants under the 2005 Plan. No additional equity awards could be issued from the 1997 Plan after the adoption of the 2005 Plan on May 26, 2005. Stock Options. Under the terms of the Plans, incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options must have an exercise price at or above the fair market value of our stock on the date of the grant. Typically, nonqualified stock options vest at the rate of 25% per year commencing on the first or second anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth anniversary date of the grant. Additionally, certain stock options may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. No incentive stock options have been issued under the 2005 Plan. We estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for purposes of valuing stock option awards. Our determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted and the assumptions used in determining fair value at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model follow.  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal  Fiscal  Fiscal    Per share weighted average fair value $ 32.28  $ 21.85  $ 20.26 Risk-free interest rate 2.7 %  1.9 %  1.4 % Assumed volatility 21.3 %  19.4 %  20.7 % Assumed dividend yield 2.3 %  2.4 %  2.1 % Assumed lives of options 5 years  5 years  5 years ##TABLE_ENDThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised follow. ##TABLE_START in millions Fiscal  Fiscal  Fiscal   Total intrinsic value of stock options exercised   ##TABLE_ENDA summary of stock option activity by number of shares and weighted average exercise price follows. ##TABLE_START shares in thousands Number of Shares  Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at January 28, 2018 7,196  $ 82.85 Granted  178.67 Exercised (1,072 )  59.54 Forfeited (156 )  130.78 Outstanding at February 3, 2019 6,380  91.78 ##TABLE_ENDShares of common stock issued from stock option exercises are made available from authorized and unissued common stock or treasury stock.

Restricted Stock and Performance Shares. Restrictions on the restricted stock issued under the Plans generally lapse according to one of the following schedules: ##TABLE_START  the restrictions on the restricted stock lapse over various periods up to five years; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the restrictions on 25% of the restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing upon the associates attainment of age 62; or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the restrictions on 25% of the restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing upon the earlier of the associates attainment of age 60 or the tenth anniversary of the grant date. ##TABLE_END At the grant date of the award, recipients of restricted stock are granted voting rights and generally receive dividends on unvested shares, paid in the form of cash on each dividend payment date. Additionally, certain restricted stock awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. We have also granted performance shares under the Plans, the payout of which is dependent on our performance against target average ROIC and operating profit over a three-year performance cycle. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service and minimum performance targets are achieved. Recipients of performance shares have no voting rights until payout of the awards. Dividend equivalents accrue on the performance shares (as reinvested shares) and are paid upon the payout of the award based upon the actual number of shares earned. The fair value of the restricted stock and performance shares is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Shares. Each restricted stock unit entitles the associate to one share of common stock to be received upon vesting up to five years after the grant date. Additionally, certain awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. Recipients of restricted stock units have no voting rights until the vesting of the award. Recipients receive dividend equivalents that accrue on unvested units and are paid out in the form of additional shares of stock on the vesting date. The fair value of the restricted stock units is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and is expensed over the period during which the units vest. We grant awards of deferred shares to non-employee directors under the Plans. Each deferred share entitles the non-employee director to one share of common stock to be received following termination of Board service. Recipients of deferred shares have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalents that accrue and are paid out in the form of additional shares of stock upon payout of the underlying shares following termination of service. The fair value of the deferred shares is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and is expensed immediately upon grant.

At February 3, 2019 , there were 19 million shares available under the U.S. plan and 19 million shares available under the non-U.S. plan. The purchase price of shares under the ESPPs is equal to 85% of the stocks fair market value on the last day of the purchase period, which is a six-month period ending on December 31 and June 30 of each year. During fiscal 2018 , there were 1 million shares purchased under the ESPPs at an average price of $155.79 .

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP Atlanta, Georgia March 28, 2019  ", "9B": " Item 9B.
