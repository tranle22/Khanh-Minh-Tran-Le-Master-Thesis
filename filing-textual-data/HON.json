Our sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers were 7, 9 and 10 percent of our total sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 10, 11 and 11 percent of our total sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our Aerospace results of operations can be impacted by various industry and economic conditions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. U.S. Government Sales Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by our Aerospace segment), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $4,288, $4,240 and $4,011 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a prime contractor and subcontractor, of $3,455, $3,412 and $3,192 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. U.S. defense spending increased in 2009 and is also expected to increase in 2010. We do not expect to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2010 federal spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEM production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs). Our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to audits, investigations, and termination by the government. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. Backlog Our total backlog at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $13,182 and $12,972 million, respectively. We anticipate that approximately $9,339 million of the 2009 backlog will be filled in 2010. We believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option. Competition We are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas. Competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions. Competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us, and vary by country. Depending on the particular customer or market involved, our businesses compete on a variety of factors, such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are generally important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors for certain products include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. However, a number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies, some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers. See Item 1A Risk Factors for further discussion. International Operations We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development mainly in the United States, Europe, Canada, Asia and Latin America. U.S. exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 12, 10 and 10 percent of our total sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Foreign manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe, were 39 percent of our total sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Approximately 18 percent of total 2009 sales of Aerospace-related products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products and systems and performance of services such as aircraft repair and overhaul. Exports were principally made to Europe, Canada, Asia and Latin America. Foreign manufactured products and systems and performance of services comprised approximately 15 percent of total 2009 Aerospace sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Canada, Mexico and Asia. Approximately 2 percent of total 2009 sales of Automation and Control Solutions products were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Foreign manufactured products and performance of services accounted for 57 percent of total 2009 Automation and Control Solutions sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe with less significant operations in Asia and Canada. Approximately 31 percent of total 2009 sales of Specialty Materials products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Exports were principally made to Asia and Latin America. Foreign manufactured products and performance of services comprised 25 percent of total 2009 Specialty Materials sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Asia and Canada. Exports of U.S. manufactured products comprised 1 percent of total 2009 sales of Transportation Systems products. Foreign manufactured products accounted for 68 percent of total 2009 sales of Transportation Systems. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Asia and Latin America. Financial information including net sales and long-lived assets related to geographic areas is included in Note 24 of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Information regarding the economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international operations is included in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Raw Materials The principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available. We experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials and commodities in 2009. We are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials, except related to phenol, a raw material used in our Specialty Materials segment. We purchase phenol under a supply agreement with one supplier. The costs of certain key raw materials, including natural gas, benzene (the key component in phenol), ethylene, fluorspar and sulfur in our Specialty Materials business, steel, nickel, other metals and ethylene glycol in our Transportation Systems business, and nickel, titanium and other metals in our Aerospace business, are expected to remain volatile. In addition, in 2009 certain large long-term fixed supplier price agreements expired, primarily relating to components used by our Aerospace business, which in the aggregate, subjected us to higher volatility in certain component costs. We will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2010. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion. We are highly dependent on our suppliers and subcontractors in order to meet commitments to our customers. In addition, many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a single-source basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies. We maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties. While we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Furthermore, the inability of these suppliers to meet their quality and/or delivery commitments to us, due to bankruptcy, natural disasters or any other reason, may result in significant costs and delay, including those in connection with the required recertification of parts from new suppliers with our customers or regulatory agencies. Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. We own, or are licensed under, a large number of patents, patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years, which relate to many of our products or improvements to those products and which are of importance to our business. From time to time, new patents and trademarks are obtained, and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others. We also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and services produced by other companies. In our judgment, those rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any patent, trademark or related group of patents, or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product, to be of material importance in relation to our total business. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion. We have registered trademarks for a number of our products and services, including Honeywell, Aclar, Ademco, Autolite, Bendix, Enovate, Fire-Lite, FRAM, Garrett, Hand Held, Holts, Jurid, Metrologic, MK, North, Notifier, Novar, Prestone, Redex, RMG, Simoniz, Spectra, System Sensor and UOP. Research and Development Our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of new products, technologies and processes and the development of new uses for existing products. The Company has research and development activities in the U.S., Europe, India and China. Research and development (RD) expense totaled $1,330, $1,543 and $1,459 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in RD expense in 2009 compared to 2008 of 14 percent was consistent with our 15 percent decrease in net sales. However, as a percentage of sales, RD increased to 4.3 percent in 2009 compared to 4.2 percent in 2008. The increase as a percentage of sales was driven by lower sales, product, design and development costs in Automation and Control Solutions and Specialty Materials as well as expenditures on the development of turbocharging systems for new platforms, partially offset by lower RD expense in Aerospace primarily due to major program completions. The increase in RD expense in 2008 compared to 2007 of 6 percent was mainly due to additional product, design and development costs in Automation and Control Solutions, increased expenditures on the development of products for new aircraft platforms and increased expenditures on the development of turbocharging systems for new platforms. Customer-sponsored (principally the U.S. Government) RD activities amounted to an additional $852, $903 and $881 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Environment We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. It is our policy to comply with these requirements, and we believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys Superfund priority list. Although, under some court interpretations of these laws, there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole. We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Companys business or markets that it serves, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. Further information, including the current status of significant environmental matters and the financial impact incurred for remediation of such environmental matters, if any, is included in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Employees We have approximately 122,000 employees at December 31, 2009, of which approximately 54,000 were located in the United States. ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements We have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including the overview of the Company and each of our segments and the discussion of their respective economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2010. These sections and other parts of this report (including this Item 1A) contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. Risk Factors Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the market and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations. The operating results of our segments are impacted by general global industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns, demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing and shipping costs. The operating results of our Aerospace segment, which generated 35 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2009, are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production, the deferral or cancellation of orders for new aircraft, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft platforms, the retirement of aircraft, global flying hours, and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates, as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts, supplier consolidation, factory transitions, capacity constraints, and the level and mix of U.S. Government appropriations for defense and space programs (as further discussed in other risk factors below). The challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry is expected to continue and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including global flying hours, aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline consolidation, airline insolvencies, terrorism and safety concerns as well as changes in regulations. Future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our Aerospace aftermarket sales and margins. The operating results of our Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) segment, which generated 41 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2009, are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation, industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion, inventory levels in distribution channels, and global economic growth rates. Specialty Materials operating results, which generated 13 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2009, are impacted by global economic growth rates, capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, and commodity demand volatility. Transportation Systems operating results, which generated 11 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2009, are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, and regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, delays in launch schedules for new automotive platforms, and consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket and car care products. The challenging operating environment faced by global automotive and truck manufacturers is expected to continue and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors, including access to and terms of government assistance, ability to reduce high inventory levels, ability to reduce operating costs, and the ability of consumers to obtain financing for new vehicle purchases. Each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices (as further described below) and non-material inflation. Raw material price fluctuations and the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements can increase the cost of our products and services and impact our ability to meet commitments to customers. The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in our Specialty Materials (benzene (the key component in phenol), natural gas, ethylene, fluorspar and sulfur), Transportation Systems (nickel, steel, other metals and ethylene glycol) and Aerospace (nickel, titanium and other metals) segments. Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations. Our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials (including raw materials) by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions, quality standards, and applicable laws and regulations. In addition, many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a single-source basis; in limited circumstances these suppliers are the sole source of the component or equipment. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers ability to adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their non-performance. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters, extreme weather events, pandemic health issues, terrorist actions, labor disputes, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes (e.g., product certification or stewardship requirements, sourcing restrictions, climate change or greenhouse gas emission standards, etc.). Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. Transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays, including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/or regulatory agencies. In addition, because our businesses cannot always immediately adapt their cost structure to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity for certain products may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements, which could adversely impact our operating costs, profitability and customer and supplier relationships. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins. Our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) develop and retain individuals with the requisite expertise. Our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources. These development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts. We own or are licensed under a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications, trademarks and copyrights. Our intellectual property rights may expire or be challenged, invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms. In some non-U.S. countries, laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application, which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights. Any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs, and/or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations. Our international operations, including U.S. exports, comprise a growing proportion of our operating results. Our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets, including developing markets such as Mexico, China, India, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. In 2009, 51 percent of our total sales (including products manufactured in the U.S. and in international locations) were outside of the U.S. including 28 percent in Europe and 11 percent in Asia. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes and trade restrictions), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, government instability, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. The cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. As we continue to grow our businesses internationally, our operating results could be increasingly affected by the relative strength of the European and Asian economies and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. We do have a policy to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities, but such activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us and may not be successful in eliminating such volatility. We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our long-lived assets or available for sale investments. At December 31, 2009, the net carrying value of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) and available for sale securities totaled approximately $17.5 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other long-lived assets. An other than temporary decline in the market value of our available for sale securities may also result in an impairment charge. Future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareowners equity and increase our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, which could negatively impact our credit rating and access to the public debt and equity markets. A change in the level of U.S. Government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact sales of Aerospaces defense and space-related product and services. Sales of our defense and space-related products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets, particularly the U.S. defense budget. Sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. Department of Defense comprised approximately 32 and 11 percent of Aerospace and total sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2009. Although U.S. defense spending increased in 2009 and is expected to increase again in 2010, we cannot predict the extent to which total funding and/or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the 2011 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by Congress, or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations. We also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning and/or the nature of war-related activity on existing, follow-on or replacement programs. A shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate and/or reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations. As a supplier of military and other equipment to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unusual risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance. In addition to normal business risks, companies like Honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the U.S. Government are subject to unusual risks, including dependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds, changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments, significant changes in contract scheduling, complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete, necessity for constant design improvements, intense competition for U.S. Government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development, difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work, and other factors characteristic of the industry, such as contract award protests and delays in the timing of contract approvals. Changes are customary over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly development contracts, and generally result in adjustments of contract prices. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to audits. Like many other government contractors, we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts or changes to certain accounting systems or controls to comply with various government regulations. We have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in appropriate cases and may do so in the future. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, plus termination costs and a reasonable profit. If a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for additional costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from any other source and any other damages suffered by the government. We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If Honeywell or one of its businesses were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental or export laws), it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. The U.S. Government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other egregious misconduct. Debarment generally does not exceed three years. Our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees, agents or business partners. We cannot ensure that our extensive compliance controls, policies and procedures will in all instances protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including laws governing payments to government officials, competition and data privacy. Any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, results of operations and reputation. Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations. Safety and performance regulations (including mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft), product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact Aerospace sales, research and development expenditures, operating costs and profitability. The demand for and cost of providing Automation and Control Solutions products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Specialty Materials results of operations can be affected by environmental (e.g. government regulation of fluorocarbons), safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations, while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our Transportation Systems segment. Legislation or regulations regarding areas such as labor and employment, employee benefit plans, tax, health and safety matters, import, export and trade, intellectual property, product certification, product liability and environmental remediation may impact the results of each of our operating segments and our consolidated results. Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned, and divestitures may not occur as planned. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, (ii) the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities, (iii) the failure to integrate acquired businesses into Honeywell on schedule and/or to achieve synergies in the planned amount or within the expected timeframe, (iv) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected timeframe, and (v) the degree of protection provided by indemnities from sellers of acquired companies and the obligations under indemnities provided to purchasers of our divested businesses. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, import and export matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings. Moreover, our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to damage awards or settlements, that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. It also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition. Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We have incurred remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We incur, and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our expenses include significant costs related to employee and retiree health benefits. With approximately 122,000 employees, including approximately 54,000 in the U.S., our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health benefits are significant. In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs, largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control, in particular, ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation. Continued increasing health-care costs, legislative or regulatory changes, and volatility in discount rates, as well as changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health benefit expenses, may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and pension contributions in future periods. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. Funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans may become more significant. However, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. For a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to estimate pension expense, including discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies included in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. In 2009, our tax expense represented 26.5 percent of our income before tax, and includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company that could effect the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. Volatility of credit markets or macro-economic factors could adversely affect our business. Changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate volatility, may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. A decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing. Delays in our customers ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing to our customers, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. The inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could result in the need to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant incremental cost and delay, as discussed above. Lastly, disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets could impact the financial institutions with which we do business. ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Environmental Matters Involving Potential Monetary Sanctions in Excess of $100,000 The United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Department of Justice (federal authorities) are investigating whether the storage of certain sludges generated during uranium hexafluoride production at our Metropolis, Illinois facility has been in compliance with the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The federal authorities have convened a grand jury in this matter. This storage issue was previously voluntarily disclosed to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, with whom Honeywell has been working to resolve the matter.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market and dividend information for Honeywells common stock is included in Note 26 of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The number of record holders of our common stock at December 31, 2009 was 64,617. Honeywell did not purchase any of its common stock, par value $1 per share, for the year ending December 31, 2009. Under the Companys previously reported $3.0 billion share repurchase program, $1.3 billion remained available as of December 31, 2009 for additional share repurchases. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating and other investing activities. Performance Graph The following graph compares the five-year cumulative total return on our Common Stock to the total returns on the Standard  Poors 500 Stock Index and a composite of Standard  Poors Aerospace and Defense and Industrial Conglomerates indices, on an equally weighted basis (the Composite Index). The selection and weighting of the Aerospace and Defense component of the Composite Index was deemed appropriate in light of the fact that Honeywells Aerospace segment has accounted for, on average, approximately 50% of our aggregate segment profit over the past three completed fiscal years. The selection and weighting of the Industrial Conglomerates component of the Composite Index reflects the diverse and distinct range of non-aerospace businesses conducted by Honeywell and their contribution to our overall segment profits. The annual changes for the five-year period shown in the graph are based on the assumption that $100 had been invested in Honeywell stock and each index on December 31, 2004 and that all dividends were reinvested.

The decrease is primarily due to lower sales as a result of the factors discussed within the Review of Business Segments section of this MDA, lower material costs, reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work scheduled reductions, benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation), the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives across each of our Business Segments and lower repositioning charges. Gross margin increased by 1.6 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to increases of 2.9 and 0.6 percent, respectively in our Specialty Materials and Automation  Controls Solutions segments, as a result of the cost savings initiatives discussed above and lower repositioning charges, partially offset by lower margins in our Transportation Systems and Aerospace Solutions segments of 3.2 and 0.7 percent, respectively, due to lower sales partially offset by the impact of cost savings initiatives. Cost of products and services sold increased by $1,694 million or 6 percent in 2008 compared with 2007. The increase is primarily due to higher sales as a result of the factors discussed within the Review of Business Segments section of this MDA, acquisitions and higher repositioning charges, partially offset by lower pension and other post retirement benefits expense. Gross margin decreased by 0.6 of a percentage point in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to (i) higher repositioning charges and (ii) decreases of 2.2 and 1.4 percent, respectively, in our Transportation Systems and Specialty Materials segments, primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by (i) lower pension and other post retirement benefits expense, (ii) higher margins in our Automation and Controls Solutions segment of 0.8 of a percentage point mainly resulting from productivity savings, and (iii) higher margins in our Aerospace segment of 0.2 of a percentage point mainly resulting from sales volume growth and increased prices.

The increase as a percentage of sales was driven by lower sales volumes, substantially offset by i) the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives across each of our Business Segments, ii) reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work schedule reductions, benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation) and iii) lower repositioning charges, resulting in decreased SGA expense of $692 million. SGA as a percentage of sales increased by 0.6 of a percentage point in 2008 compared with 2007. The increase was primarily due to higher SGA in our Automation and Control Solutions segment mainly due to acquisitions, partially offset by decreases in SGA in our Specialty Materials and Aerospace segments mainly due to cost savings initiatives and the positive impact of prior repositioning actions. Other (Income)/Expense ##TABLE_START          2009  2008  2007   (Dollars in millions) Gain on sale of non-strategic businesses and assets   $  (87 )    $  (635 )    $  (19 )  Equity (income)/loss of affiliated companies    (26 )     (63 )     (10 )  Interest income    (33 )     (102 )     (81 )  Foreign exchange    45     52     34  Other (net)    46          7         Total   $  (55 )    $  (748 )    $  (69 )         ##TABLE_END Other income decreased by $693 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to i) a lower gain on sale of non-strategic businesses and assets due to the gain on the sale of our Consumables Solutions business in 2008 partially offset by a gain related to the deconsolidation of a subsidiary within our Automation and Control Solutions segment in 2009 (See Note 4 to the financial statements) and ii) lower interest income primarily due to lower interest rates on cash balances. Other income increased by $679 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a higher gain on sale of non-strategic businesses and assets representing the sale of our Consumables Solutions business and higher income from equity method investments (mainly in our Specialty Material segment). Interest and Other Financial Charges ##TABLE_START          2009  2008  2007   (Dollars in millions) Interest and other financial charges   $     $     $   % change compared with prior year    1 %      %    ##TABLE_END Interest and other financial charges increased 1 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 due to lower debt balances offset by higher borrowing costs on term debt. Interest and other financial charges were flat in 2008 compared to 2007 due to higher debt balances offset by lower borrowing costs. Tax Expense ##TABLE_START          2009  2008  2007   (Dollars in millions) Tax expense   $     $  1,009    $   Effective tax rate    26.5 %     26.4 %     26.3 %  ##TABLE_END The effective tax rate increased by 0.1 of a percentage point in 2009 compared with 2008 due principally to a decreased impact from the settlement of audits, partially offset by increased benefits from (i) U.S. manufacturing incentives, (ii) U.S. tax credits and (iii) employee stock ownership plan dividends. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign rates. The effective tax rate increased by 0.1 of a percentage point in 2008 compared with 2007 due principally to a higher overall state effective tax rate and a decreased impact from the settlement of audits, partially offset by a decrease in the foreign effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign tax rates. In 2010, the effective tax could change based upon the Companys operating results and the outcome of tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns currently under audit by various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities, several of which may be finalized in the foreseeable future. The Company believes that it has adequate reserves for these matters, the outcome of which could materially impact the results of operations and operating cash flows in the period they are resolved. Net Income Attributable to Honeywell ##TABLE_START          2009  2008  2007   (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Net income attributable to Honeywell   $  2,153    $  2,792    $  2,444  Earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution   $  2.85    $  3.76    $  3.16  ##TABLE_END The decrease of $0.91 in earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily relates to a decrease in segment profit in each of our business segments, decreased Other (Income) Expense, as discussed above, and an increase in the number of shares outstanding partially offset by lower repositioning charges. The increase of $0.60 in earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily relates to (i) the gain on sale of the Consumables Solutions business, (ii) lower pension and other post retirement expense, (iii) an increase in segment profit (most significantly in Automation and Control Solutions and Aerospace, partially offset by a decline in Transportation Systems segment profit) and (iv) a reduction in the number of shares outstanding due to share repurchases, partially offset by increased repositioning costs. For further discussion of segment results, see Review of Business Segments. BUSINESS OVERVIEW This Business Overview provides a summary of Honeywell and its four reportable operating segments (Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions, Specialty Materials and Transportation Systems), including their respective areas of focus for 2010 and the relevant economic and other factors impacting their results, and a discussion of each segments results for the three years ended December 31, 2009. Each of these segments is comprised of various product and service classes that serve multiple end markets. See Note 23 to the financial statements for further information on our reportable segments and our definition of segment profit. Economic and Other Factors In addition to the factors listed below with respect to each of our operating segments, our consolidated operating results are principally driven by: ##TABLE_START     Impact of global economic growth rates (U.S., Europe and emerging regions) and industry conditions on demand in our key end markets;     Overall sales mix, in particular the mix of Aerospace original equipment and aftermarket sales and the mix of Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) products and services sales;     The extent to which cost savings from productivity actions are able to offset or exceed the impact of material and non-material inflation;     The impact of the pension discount rate on pension expense and pension asset returns on funding requirements; and     The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rate, particularly the U.S. dollar-Euro exchange rate. ##TABLE_END Areas of Focus for 2010 The areas of focus for 2010, which are generally applicable to each of our operating segments, include: ##TABLE_START     Driving profitable growth by building innovative products that address customer needs;     Achieving sales growth, technological excellence and manufacturing capability through global expansion, especially focused on emerging regions in China, India and the Middle East;     Proactively managing raw material costs through formula and long term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities, where feasible; ##TABLE_END 25 ##TABLE_START     Driving cash flow conversion through effective working capital management and capital investment in our businesses, thereby enabling liquidity, repayment of debt, strategic acquisitions, and the ability to return value to shareholders;     Actively monitoring trends in short-cycle end markets, such as the Transportations Systems Turbo business, ACS Products businesses, Aerospace commercial aftermarket and Specialty Materials resins and chemicals, and continuing to take proactive cost actions;     Aligning and prioritizing investments in long-term growth vs. short-term demand volatility;     Driving productivity savings through execution of repositioning actions;     Maintaining reduced discretionary spending levels with focus on non-customer related costs;     Ensuring preparedness to maximize performance in response to the end of customer inventory de-stocking and/or improving end market conditions while controlling costs by proactively managing capacity utilization, supply chain and inventory demand;     Utilizing our enablers Honeywell Operating System (HOS), Functional Transformation and Velocity Product Development (VPD) to standardize the way we work, increase quality and reduce the costs of product manufacturing, reduce costs and enhance the quality of our administrative functions and improve business operations through investments in systems and process improvements;     Monitoring both suppliers and customers for signs of liquidity constraints, limiting exposure to any resulting inability to meet delivery commitments or pay amounts due, and identifying alternate sources of supply as necessary; and     Managing Corporate costs, including costs incurred for asbestos and environmental matters, pension and other post-retirement expenses and our tax expense. ##TABLE_END Review of Business Segments ##TABLE_START          2009  2008  2007   (Dollars in millions) Net Sales       Aerospace   $  10,763    $  12,650    $  12,236  Automation and Control Solutions    12,611     14,018     12,478  Specialty Materials    4,144     5,266     4,866  Transportation Systems    3,389     4,622     5,009  Corporate    1                     $  30,908    $  36,556    $  34,589         Segment Profit       Aerospace   $  1,893    $  2,300    $  2,197  Automation and Control Solutions    1,588     1,622     1,405  Specialty Materials    605     721     658  Transportation Systems    156     406     583  Corporate    (145 )     (204 )     (189 )            $  4,097    $  4,845    $  4,654         ##TABLE_END 26 A reconciliation of segment profit to income from continuing operations before taxes follows: ##TABLE_START          2009  2008  2007   (Dollars in millions) Segment profit   $  4,097    $  4,845    $  4,654  Other income (expense)(1)    29     685     69  Interest and other financial charges    (459 )     (456 )     (456 )  Stock compensation expense(2),(3)    (118 )     (128 )     (65 )  Pension and other postretirement benefits expense(2)    (93 )     (113 )     (322 )  Repositioning and other charges(2)    (478 )     (1,012 )     (543 )         Income from continuing operations before taxes   $  2,978    $  3,821    $  3,337         ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1)    Equity income/(loss) of affiliated companies was included in Segment Profit, on a prospective basis, commencing January 1, 2008.

Stock option expense is included for all periods presented. ##TABLE_END Aerospace Overview Aerospace is a leading global supplier of aircraft engines, avionics, and related products and services for aircraft manufacturers, airlines, aircraft operators, military services, and defense and space contractors. Our Aerospace products and services include auxiliary power units, propulsion engines, environmental control systems, engine controls, flight safety, communications, navigation, radar and surveillance systems, aircraft lighting, management and technical services, advanced systems and instruments, aircraft wheels and brakes and repair and overhaul services. Aerospace sells its products to original equipment (OE) manufacturers in the air transport, regional, business and general aviation aircraft segments, and provides spare parts and repair and maintenance services for the aftermarket (principally to aircraft operators). The United States Government is also a major customer for our defense and space products. Economic and Other Factors Aerospace operating results are principally driven by: ##TABLE_START     New aircraft production rates and delivery schedules set by commercial air transport, regional jet, business and general aviation OE manufacturers, as well as airline profitability and retirement of aircraft from service;     Global demand for commercial air travel as reflected in global flying hours and utilization rates for corporate and general aviation aircraft, as well as the demand for spare parts and maintenance and repair services for aircraft currently in use;     Level and mix of U.S. Government appropriations for defense and space programs and military activity; and     Availability and price volatility of raw materials such as titanium and other metals. ##TABLE_END 27 Results of Operations ##TABLE_START          2009  2008  2007   (Dollars in millions) Net sales   $  10,763    $  12,650    $  12,236  % change compared with prior year    (15 )%     3 %    Segment profit   $  1,893    $  2,300    $  2,197  % change compared with prior year    (18 )%     5 %    ##TABLE_END Aerospace sales by major customer end-markets were as follows: ##TABLE_START            Customer End-Markets  % of Aerospace Sales  % Change in Sales  2009  2008  2007  2009 Versus 2008  2008 Versus 2007 Commercial:           Air transport and regional original equipment    13 %     14 %     16 %     (21 )%     (6 )%  Air transport and regional aftermarket    22     23     22     (16 )     4  Business and general aviation original equipment    7     11     11     (51 )     5  Business and general aviation aftermarket    8     10     10     (27 )     6  Defense and Space    50     42     41          6             Total    100 %     100 %     100 %     (15 )%     3 %             ##TABLE_END 2009 compared with 2008 Aerospace sales decreased by 15 percent in 2009. Details regarding the decrease in sales by customer end-markets are as follows: ##TABLE_START     Air transport and regional original equipment (OE) sales decreased by 21 percent in 2009. The decrease is driven by lower sales to our OE customers, consistent with production rates and platform mix, and the impact of divesting our Consumables Solutions business, partially offset by a 12 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 2009 mainly due to the absence of a strike at a major OEM in the fourth quarter of 2008.     Air transport and regional aftermarket sales decreased by 16 percent in 2009 primarily due to decreased sales of spare parts and lower maintenance activity driven by the impact of higher parked aircraft part utilization, customer inventory reduction initiatives and decreased flying hours of approximately 2 percent, including a 1 percent increase in the fourth quarter. While we expect global flying hours to increase slightly in 2010, we expect aftermarket sales to remain soft in the first half of 2010 due to the continuation of inventory destocking and the rising number of parked aircraft.     Business and general aviation OE sales decreased by 51 percent in 2009 due to the decrease in new business jet deliveries reflecting rescheduling and cancellations of deliveries by OE customers.     Business and general aviation aftermarket sales decreased by 27 percent in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of spare parts and lower revenue associated with maintenance service agreements, consistent with the decrease in business jet utilization. We started to see an increase in business jet utilization rates in the fourth quarter of 2009 and expect stabilization at these levels.     Defense and space sales were essentially unchanged in 2009, primarily due to higher sales of logistics services and original equipment for military platforms in the first nine months of 2009 offset by program completions. Delays in defense and space programs could impact the timing of sales in this end- market over the course of 2010. ##TABLE_END Aerospace segment profit decreased by 18 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to lower sales as a result of the factors discussed above and inflation, partially offset by volume related material cost reductions and reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work schedule reductions, benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation), the positive impact of cost savings initiatives and increased prices. 2008 compared with 2007 Aerospace sales increased by 3 percent in 2008. Details regarding the net increase in sales by customer end-markets are as follows: ##TABLE_START     Air transport and regional original equipment (OE) sales decreased by 6 percent in 2008. The decrease was driven by the sale of our Consumables Solutions business, partially offset by increased deliveries to our air transport customers, notwithstanding a decrease in total aircraft production rates at major OEMs mainly due to a strike at a major OEM, which was settled in the fourth quarter of 2008.     Air transport and regional aftermarket sales increased by 4 percent in 2008 primarily due to increased volume, the price of spare parts and aftermarket growth driven by flight hour growth. The growth rate in global flying hours slowed to 3 percent in 2008, including a 2 percent decline in the fourth quarter.     Business and general aviation OE sales increased by 5 percent in 2008 due to continued demand in the business jet end market as evidenced by an increase in new business jet deliveries, improved pricing and continued additions to the fractional ownership and charter fleets. In 2008, sales to this end- market primarily consisted of sales of Primus Epic integrated avionics systems and the TFE 731 and HTF 7000 engines.     Business and general aviation aftermarket sales increased by 6 percent in 2008. The increase was primarily due to increased revenue under maintenance service agreements and higher sales of spare parts.     Defense and space sales increased by 6 percent in 2008. The increase was primarily due to logistics services (including the positive impact of the acquisition of Dimensions International, a defense logistics business), helicopter OE sales, an increase in government funded engineering related to the Orion (CEV) program, higher sales of specialty foam insulation, certain surface systems and classified space programs. ##TABLE_END Aerospace segment profit increased by 5 percent in 2008 compared to 2007 due primarily to increased prices, productivity and sales volume growth. These increases are partially offset by inflation, the Consumables Solutions divestiture and higher spending to support new platform growth. 2010 Areas of Focus Aerospaces primary areas of focus for 2010 include: ##TABLE_START     Focus on cost structure initiatives to maintain profitability in the face of challenging commercial aerospace conditions;     Aligning inventory, production and research and development with customer demand and production schedules;     Expanding sales and operations in international locations;     Pursuit of new defense and space platforms;     Continuing to design equipment that enhances the safety, performance and durability of aerospace and defense equipment, while reducing weight and operating costs;     Delivering world-class customer service and achieving cycle and lead time reduction to improve responsiveness to customer demand; and     Continued deployment of our common enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. ##TABLE_END 29 Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) Overview ACS provides innovative products and solutions that make homes, buildings, industrial sites and infrastructure more efficient, safe and comfortable. Our ACS products and services include controls for heating, cooling, indoor air quality, ventilation, humidification, lighting and home automation; advanced software applications for home/building control and optimization; sensors, switches, control systems and instruments for measuring pressure, air flow, temperature and electrical current; security, fire and gas detection; personal protection equipment; access control; video surveillance; remote patient monitoring systems; products for automatic identification and data collection, installation, maintenance and upgrades of systems that keep buildings safe, comfortable and productive; and automation and control solutions for industrial plants, including advanced software and automation systems that integrate, control and monitor complex processes in many types of industrial settings as well as equipment that controls, measures and analyzes natural gas production and transportation. Economic and Other Factors ACSs operating results are principally driven by: ##TABLE_START     Global commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades);     Demand for residential security and environmental control retrofits and upgrades;     Demand for energy efficient products and solutions;     Industrial production;     Government and public sector spending;     U.S. and European economic conditions;     Economic growth rates in developed (U.S. and Europe) and emerging markets;     The strength of capital and operating spending on process (including petrochemical and refining) and building automation;     Inventory levels in distribution channels; and     Changes to energy, fire, security, health care, safety and environmental concerns and regulations. ##TABLE_END Results of Operations ##TABLE_START          2009  2008  2007   (Dollars in millions) Net sales   $  12,611    $  14,018    $  12,478  % change compared with prior year    (10 )%     12 %    Segment profit   $  1,588    $  1,622    $  1,405  % change compared with prior year    (2 )%     15 %    ##TABLE_END 2009 compared with 2008 ACS sales decreased by 10 percent in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to decreased sales volume (reflecting slower global economic growth) and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 4 percent, partially offset by a 3 percent growth from acquisitions. ##TABLE_START     Sales in our Products businesses decreased by 11 percent, including (i) lower volumes of sales in each of our businesses (excluding the impact of acquisitions) and (ii) the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Softness in residential and industrial end-markets was partially offset by the positive impact of acquisitions, most significantly Norcross Safety Products.     Sales in our Solutions businesses decreased by 9 percent primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and volume decreases largely due to softening demand as a result of customer deferral of capital and operating expenditures. Orders decreased while backlog ##TABLE_END 30 ##TABLE_START     increased in 2009. Decreased orders are primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, softening demand (as noted above) and order timing and delays. Higher backlog is primarily due to longer duration projects. The impact of these factors was partially offset by the positive impact of acquisitions, most significantly the RMG Group. ##TABLE_END ACS segment profit decreased by 2 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 principally due to the negative impact of lower sales as a result of the factors discussed above and inflation, partially offset by lower material costs, reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work schedule reductions, benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation) and the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives. In the fourth quarter of 2009 these factors more than offset the impact of lower sales described above resulting in a 5 percent increase in segment profit. 2008 compared with 2007 ACS sales increased by 12 percent in 2008 compared with 2007, including 10 percent net growth from acquisitions and divestitures. Although foreign exchange had minimal impact on full year sales, there was a 9 percent negative impact of foreign exchange on fourth quarter sales. ##TABLE_START     Sales in our Products businesses grew by 15 percent, including (i) the positive impact of acquisitions, most significantly Norcross Safety Products, Metrologic Instruments, Hand Held Products Inc and Maxon Corporation, (ii) continued strong demand for life safety products, particularly fire systems and sensors and (iii) increased sales of our environmental and combustion products, driven by new products and demand for energy efficient controls, including growth across all regions. These factors were partially offset by decreases in sales volumes of our security (reflecting U.S. and European residential construction softness) and sensing and controls products (most notably automotive customers), reflecting softness in the U.S. and Europe.     Sales in our Solutions businesses increased by 8 percent primarily due to (i) volume growth, driven by continued orders growth and strong conversion to sales from our orders backlog and (ii) the positive impact of acquisitions, most significantly Enraf Holding B.V. ##TABLE_END ACS segment profit increased by 15 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 principally due to increased productivity savings, acquisitions, and improved pricing, partially offset by inflation. 2010 Areas of Focus ACSs primary areas of focus for 2010 include: ##TABLE_START     Products and solutions for energy efficiency and asset management;     Extending technology leadership: lowest total installed cost and integrated product solutions;     Defending and extending our installed base through customer productivity and globalization;     Sustaining strong brand recognition through our brand and channel management;     Centralization and standardization of global software development capabilities;     Continuing to identify, execute and integrate acquisitions in or adjacent to the markets which we serve;     Continuing to establish and grow emerging markets presence and capability;     Continuing to invest in new product development and introductions; and     Continued deployment of our common ERP system. ##TABLE_END Specialty Materials Overview Specialty Materials develops and manufactures high-purity, high-quality and high-performance chemicals and materials for applications in the refining, petrochemical, automotive, healthcare, agricultural, packaging, refrigeration, appliance, housing, semiconductor, wax and adhesives segments. Specialty Materials also provides process technology, products and services for the petroleum refining, gas processing technology, petrochemical and other industries. Specialty Materials product portfolio includes fluorocarbons, caprolactam, ammonium sulfate for fertilizer, specialty films, advanced fibers, customized research chemicals and intermediates, electronic materials and chemicals, catalysts, and adsorbents. Economic and Other Factors Specialty Materials operating results are principally driven by: ##TABLE_START     Level and timing of capital spending and capacity and utilization rates in refining and petrochemical end markets;     Degree of pricing volatility in raw materials such as benzene (the key component in phenol), fluorspar, natural gas, ethylene and sulfur;     Impact of environmental and energy efficiency regulations;     Extent of change in order rates from global semiconductor customers;     Global demand for non-ozone depleting Hydro fluorocarbons (HFCs);     Condition of the U.S. residential housing industry;     Global demand for commodities such as caprolactam and ammonium sulfate; and     Increasing demand for renewable energy and biofuels. ##TABLE_END Results of Operations ##TABLE_START          2009  2008  2007   (Dollars in millions) Net sales   $  4,144    $  5,266    $  4,866  % change compared with prior year    (21 )%     8 %     5 %  Segment profit   $     $     $   % change compared with prior year    (16 )%     10 %     16 %  ##TABLE_END 2009 compared with 2008 Specialty Materials sales decreased by 21 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily driven by (i) a 32 percent decrease in Resins and Chemicals sales due to substantial price declines arising from pass through of lower raw materials costs, partially offset by increased volume (most notably in the fourth quarter), (ii) a 19 percent decrease in UOP sales due to customer deferrals of projects as a result of reduced demand for additional capacity in the refining and petrochemical industries as well as lower catalyst sales, (iii) a 22 percent decrease in Specialty Products sales most significantly due to continued demand softness across key customer end-markets, and (iv) an 11 percent decrease in Fluorine Products sales due to lower volume sales of refrigerants and insulating materials principally driven by customer inventory reduction initiatives and soft construction and original equipment manufacturing end markets, partially offset by price increases. Specialty Materials segment profit decreased by 16 percent in 2009 compared with 2008. This decrease is principally due to lower sales as a result of the factors discussed above, partially offset by lower material costs, reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work schedule reductions and lower incentive compensation), the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives and increased prices. In the fourth quarter of 2009 these factors more than offset the impact of lower sales described above resulting in a 56 percent increase in segment profit. 2008 compared with 2007 Specialty Materials sales increased by 8 percent in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily driven by (i) increased pricing reflecting the pass-through of higher raw material costs and other pricing actions (including benefits from formula based pricing arrangements), most significantly in Resins and Chemicals and Fluorine Products, and (ii) an 8 percent increase in UOP sales as a result of higher volume sales in its products and projects businesses. Full year 2008 sales growth was partially offset by a 12 percent sales decline in revenue during the fourth quarter, primarily in our Resins and Chemicals business due to sharp declines in global demand for commodities such as caprolactam and ammonium sulfate. Specialty Materials segment profit increased by 10 percent in 2008 compared with 2007. This increase is due principally to increased UOP, Fluorine Products and Resins and Chemicals sales as a result of the factors discussed above and higher income from our joint ventures, partially offset by the impacts of hurricanes Gustav and Ike and the fourth quarter sales decline noted below. Overall, the effects of increased pricing reflecting the pass-through of higher raw material costs and other pricing actions (including benefits from formula based pricing arrangements) and productivity gains more than offset raw material (most significantly sulfur) and other inflation. 2010 Areas of Focus Specialty Materials primary areas of focus for 2010 include: ##TABLE_START     Continue to develop new processes, products and technologies that address energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, global warming, security regulations and position the portfolio for higher value;     Commercialize new products and technologies in the petrochemical, gas processing and refining industries;     Drive sales and marketing excellence and expand local presence in fast growing emerging markets;     Execution of awarded government stimulus projects and pursuit of additional projects;     Manage exposure to raw material commodity fluctuations; and     Prioritize critical investment to increase plant reliability and attainment, productivity, quality and operational excellence. ##TABLE_END Transportation Systems Overview Transportation Systems provides automotive products that improve the performance, efficiency, and appearance of cars, trucks, and other vehicles through state-of-the-art technologies, world class brands and global solutions to customers needs. Transportation Systems products include turbochargers and charge-air and thermal systems; car care products including anti-freeze (Prestone(R)), filters (Fram(R)), spark plugs (Autolite(R)), and cleaners, waxes and additives (Holts(R)); and brake hard parts and other friction materials (Bendix(R) and Jurid(R)). Transportation Systems sells its products to original equipment (OE) automotive and truck manufacturers (e.g., BMW, Caterpillar, Daimler, Renault, Ford, and Volkswagen), wholesalers and distributors and through the retail aftermarket. Economic and Other Factors Transportation Systems operating results are principally driven by: ##TABLE_START     Financial strength and stability of automotive OE manufacturers;     Global demand for automobile and truck production;     Turbo penetration rates for new engine platforms;     Global consumer preferences for boosted diesel passenger cars;     Degree of volatility in raw material prices, including nickel and steel;     New automobile production rates and the impact of customer inventory levels on demand for our products; ##TABLE_END 33 ##TABLE_START     Automotive aftermarket trends such as consumer confidence, miles driven, and consumer preference for branded vs. private label aftermarket and car care products;     Regulations mandating lower emissions and improved fuel economy; and     Consumers ability to obtain financing for new vehicle purchases. ##TABLE_END Results of Operations ##TABLE_START          2009  2008  2007   (Dollars in millions) Net sales   $  3,389    $  4,622    $  5,009  % change compared with prior year    (27 )%     (8 )%    Segment profit   $     $     $   % change compared with prior year    (62 )%     (30 )%    ##TABLE_END 2009 compared with 2008 Transportation Systems sales decreased by 27 percent in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to lower volumes (driven by the ongoing challenging global automotive industry conditions) and the negative impact of foreign exchange in the first nine months of 2009. ##TABLE_START     Turbo Technologies sales decreased by 34 percent primarily due to lower sales volumes to both our commercial and light vehicle engine manufacturing customers and the negative impact of foreign exchange. Diesel penetration rates in Western Europe declined in the first nine months of 2009 and there was a shift in consumer preference towards lower displacement engines. Full year 2009 sales decline was partially offset by a 22 percent sales increase during the fourth quarter primarily due to the positive impact of foreign exchange and higher sales volumes to our light vehicle engine manufacturing customers. We expect increased volumes to continue as we benefit from new platform launches scheduled in 2010.     CPG sales decreased by 8 percent primarily due to lower prices (primarily pass through of ethylene glycol cost decreases), lower volumes, and the negative impact of foreign exchange.     Friction Materials sales decreased by 24 percent primarily due to continued declines in sales volumes and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. ##TABLE_END Transportation Systems segment profit decreased by 62 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 due principally to lower sales volume as a result of the factors discussed above partially offset by lower material costs, reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work schedule reductions, benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation) and the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives. In the fourth quarter of 2009 these factors and increased Turbo Technologies volumes resulted in a $66 million increase in Transportation Systems segment profit. We anticipate that new platform launches will translate into increased segment profit in 2010. 2008 compared with 2007 Transportation Systems sales decreased by 8 percent in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily due to lower volumes, most significantly in the second half of 2008, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange. ##TABLE_START     Turbo Technologies sales decreased by 9 percent primarily due to decreased volume from a broad decline in vehicle production due to challenging automotive industry conditions in the U.S. and Europe, which accelerated in the second half of 2008, impacting sales to both our commercial and light vehicle engine manufacturers, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange.     Consumer Products Group (CPG) sales decreased by 10 percent primarily due to lower sales of automotive aftermarket products reflecting lower miles driven and the impact of lower consumer confidence on discretionary spending, partially offset by higher prices (including the pass through of ethylene glycol cost increases). ##TABLE_END 34 ##TABLE_START     Friction Materials sales were essentially unchanged, primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange and increased pricing offset by lower original equipment and aftermarket product sales volume. ##TABLE_END Transportation Systems segment profit decreased by 30 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to volume declines, as discussed above, material and non-material cost inflation and investments in product development to support future Turbo platforms. These factors were partially offset by increased productivity and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. 2010 Areas of Focus Transportation Systems primary areas of focus in 2010 include: ##TABLE_START     Sustaining superior turbocharger technology through successful platform launches;     Maintaining the high quality of current products while executing new product introductions;     Increasing global penetration and share of diesel and gasoline turbocharger OEM demand;     Increasing plant productivity to address capacity challenges generated by volatility in product demand and OEM inventory levels;     Aligning cost structure with current economic outlook, and successful execution of repositioning actions;     Aligning development efforts and costs with new turbo platform launch schedules; and     Continuing global expansion and extension of established strong product brands in CPG. ##TABLE_END Repositioning and Other Charges See Note 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of repositioning and other charges incurred in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Our repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of approximately $300 million in 2010 compared with 2009 principally from planned workforce reductions. Cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute our repositioning actions were $200, $157 and $92 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Such expenditures for severance and other exit costs have been funded principally through operating cash flows. Cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the remaining actions are expected to approximate $225 million in 2010 and will be funded through operating cash flows. The following tables provide details of the pretax impact of total net repositioning and other charges by segment. ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2009  2008  2007   (Dollars in millions) Aerospace       Net repositioning charge   $     $     $            Years Ended December 31,  2009  2008  2007   (Dollars in millions) Automation and Control Solutions       Net repositioning charge   $     $     $          ##TABLE_END 35 ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2009  2008  2007   (Dollars in millions) Specialty Materials       Net repositioning charge   $     $     $   Business impairment charges              9  Probable and reasonably estimable environmental liabilities         5                $     $     $          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2009  2008  2007   (Dollars in millions) Transportation Systems       Net repositioning charge   $     $     $   Asbestos related litigation charges, net of insurance    112     125     100  Probable and reasonably estimable environmental liabilities         4       Other         1                 $     $     $          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2009  2008  2007   (Dollars in millions) Corporate       Net repositioning charge   $      $     $   Asbestos related litigation charges, net of insurance    43            Probable and reasonably estimable environmental liabilities    145     456     225  Other    7     (3 )     18            $     $     $          ##TABLE_END 36 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets, as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables. We continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. Cash Flow Summary Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are summarized as follows: ##TABLE_START          2009  2008  2007   (Dollars in millions) Cash provided by (used for):       Operating activities   $  3,946    $  3,791    $  3,911  Investing activities    (1,133 )     (2,023 )     (1,782 )  Financing activities    (2,152 )     (1,370 )     (1,574 )  Effect of exchange rate changes on cash    75     (162 )     50         Net increase in cash and cash equivalents   $     $     $          ##TABLE_END 2009 compared with 2008 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $155 million during 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a favorable impact from working capital of $577 million (primarily due to lower inventory), lower cash taxes of $449 million, and $155 million from the sale of long term receivables partially offset by decreased earnings, receipts from the sale of insurance receivables of $82 million in 2008 and higher repositioning payments of $43 million. Cash used for investing activities decreased by $890 million during 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a $1,713 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions (most significantly the acquisition of Norcross and Metrolgic in 2008) and a $275 million decrease in expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, partially offset by a $908 million decrease in proceeds from sales of businesses (most significantly the divestiture of Consumables Solutions in 2008). Cash used for financing activities increased by $782 million during 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a net repayment of debt (including commercial paper) in 2009 of $1,272 million compared to net proceeds (including commercial paper) of $733 million in 2008, partially offset by a decrease in repurchases of common stock of $1,459 million. 2008 compared with 2007 Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $120 million during 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to a decrease in accrued liabilities of $475 million (decreased advances from customers and deferred income) and higher cash tax payments of $336 million (most significantly due to the sale of the Consumables Solutions business) partially offset by increased earnings, lower cash payments for asbestos of $121 million, and a decrease in working capital (lower accounts and other receivable offset by higher accounts payable). Cash used for investing activities increased by $241 million during 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to higher spending for acquisitions partially offset by higher proceeds from sales of businesses. In 2008, cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired was $2,181 million primarily for Safety Products Holding, Inc. (Norcross) and Metrologic Instruments, Inc. compared to $1,150 million in 2007, primarily for our acquisitions of Dimensions International, Enraf Holding B.V., Hand Held Products, Inc, and Maxon Corporation. Cash proceeds from divestitures were $909 million in 2008, compared to $51 million in 2007 primarily due to the sale of Consumables Solutions. Cash used for financing activities decreased by $204 million during 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to a $2,527 million decrease in repurchases of common stock partially offset by decreases in net proceeds from debt (including commercial paper) of $1,797 million and a decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock primarily related to stock option exercises of $457 million. Liquidity Each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to improve working capital turnover in 2010 to increase operating cash flows. Considering the current economic environment in which each of our businesses operate and our business plans and strategies, including our focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that our cash balances and operating cash flows will remain our principal source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets, as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables. A source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing potential acquisitions. There was $298 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2009. Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2009, Standard and Poors (SP) Fitch and Moodys have ratings on our long-term debt of A and A and A2 respectively, and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1 respectively. SP and Moodys have maintained Honeywells ratings outlook as stable. Fitchs rating outlook is negative. In 2010, we will support our credit rating through debt repayments. To date, the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity. We maintain $2.8 billion of committed bank revolving credit facilities in support of our commercial paper program, which is secured through mid-May 2012. In May 2007 Honeywell entered into a $2.8 billion Amended and Restated Five-Year Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks. Commitments under the Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement to an aggregated amount not to exceed $3.5 billion. This credit facility contains a $700 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes, including support for the issuance of commercial paper, At December 31, 2009, there were no borrowings or letters of credit issued under the credit facility. The Credit Agreement does not restrict Honeywells ability to pay dividends, nor does it contain financial covenants. In February 2009, the Company issued $600 million 3.875% Senior Notes due 2014 and $900 million 5.00% Senior Notes due 2019 (collectively, the 2009 Senior Notes). The 2009 Senior Notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywells existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of Honeywells subordinated debt. The offering resulted in gross proceeds of $1.5 billion, offset by $12 million in discount and issuance costs. Proceeds from the Senior Notes were used to repay outstanding commercial paper. In August 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of the RMG Group (RMG Regel + Messtechnik GmbH), a natural gas measuring and control products, services and integrated solutions company which will be integrated into our Automation and Control Solutions segment. The purchase price, net of cash acquired, was approximately $416 million and was funded using available cash. We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions. We sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. In April 2009, we modified the terms of the trade accounts receivable program to permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion. This modification provides additional flexibility in the management of the receivable portfolio and also requires the receivables in the program to remain on the Company balance sheet. As a result, $500 million of program receivables were reflected as Accounts, notes and other receivables with a corresponding amount recorded as Short-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These short-term borrowings were repaid as of December 31, 2009. We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Current global economic conditions or the current tightening of credit could adversely affect our customers or suppliers ability to obtain financing, particularly in our long-cycle businesses and airline and automotive end markets. Customer or supplier bankruptcies, delays in their ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing could adversely affect our cash flow or results of operations. To date we have not experienced material impacts from customer or supplier bankruptcy or liquidity issues. We continue to monitor and take measures to limit our exposure. In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions, share repurchases and any strategic acquisitions. Specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2010 to be as follows: ##TABLE_START     Capital expenditureswe expect to spend approximately $700 million for capital expenditures in 2010 primarily for cost reduction, maintenance, replacement, growth, and production and capacity expansion.     Debt repaymentsthere are $1,018 million of scheduled long-term debt maturities in 2010. We expect to refinance these maturities during 2010 utilizing short-term debt and reduce overall debt balances.     Share repurchasesUnder the Companys previously announced $3.0 billion share repurchase program, $1.3 billion remained available as of December 31, 2009 for additional share repurchases. The amount and timing of repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating and other investing activities. We do not anticipate any share repurchases during 2010.     Dividendswe expect to pay approximately $940 million in dividends on our common stock in 2010, reflecting a 4 percent increase in the number of shares outstanding.     Asbestos claimswe expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $654 and $62 million, respectively, in 2010. See Asbestos Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for further discussion.     Pension contributionsIn 2010, we are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements. However, we presently anticipate making voluntary contributions of approximately $400 million of Honeywell common stock to the U.S. plan in 2010 to improve the funded status of our plans. We also expect to make contributions to our non-U.S. plans of approximately $150 million in 2010. See Note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of pension contributions.     Repositioning actionswe expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the previously announced repositioning actions will approximate $225 million in 2010.     Environmental remediation costswe expect to spend approximately $285 million in 2010 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs. See Environmental Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for additional information. ##TABLE_END 39 We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2008 we realized $909 million in cash proceeds from sales of non-strategic businesses. In July 2008, the Company completed the sale of its Consumables Solutions business to B/E Aerospace (B/E) for $1.05 billion, consisting of approximately $901 million in cash and six million shares of B/E common stock. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, this transaction resulted in a pre- tax gain of $623 million, $417 million net of tax. These proceeds, along with our other sources and uses of liquidity, as discussed above, were utilized to invest in our existing core businesses and fund acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines, access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. Based on our current financial position and expected economic performance, we do not believe that our liquidity will be adversely impacted by an inability to access our sources of financing. Contractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments Following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2009: ##TABLE_START              Total(6)  Payments by Period  Thereafter  2010  2011- 2012  2013- 2014   (Dollars in millions) Long-term debt, including capitalized leases(1)   $  7,264    $  1,018    $     $  1,211    $  4,109  Interest payments on long-term debt, including capitalized leases    3,140     297     489     374     1,980  Minimum operating lease payments    1,213     313     419     225     256  Purchase obligations(2)    1,595     806     481     211     97  Estimated environmental liability payments(3)    779     285     290     160     44  Asbestos related liability payments(4)    1,694     654     563     266     211  Asbestos insurance recoveries(5)    (1,003 )     (62 )     (113 )     (100 )     (728 )                $  14,682    $  3,311    $  3,056    $  2,344    $  5,971             ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1)    Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity. (2)    Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. (3)    The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2009. See Environmental Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for additional information. (4)    These amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2009. NARCO estimated payments are based on the terms and conditions, including evidentiary requirements, specified in the definitive agreements or agreements in principle and pursuant to Trust Distribution Procedures. Bendix payments are based on our estimate of pending and future ##TABLE_END 40 ##TABLE_START     claims. Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause asbestos liabilities to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. See Asbestos Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for additional information. (5)    These amounts represent probable insurance recoveries through 2018 based on our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos related liabilities as of December 31, 2009. See Asbestos Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for additional information. (6)    The table excludes $720 million of uncertain tax positions. See Note 6 to the financial statements. ##TABLE_END The table also excludes our pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) obligations. During 2010, we plan to make additional voluntary contributions of Honeywell common stock to our U.S. plans to improve the funded status of our plans. We also expect to make contributions to our non-U.S. plans of approximately $150 million in 2010. Beyond 2010, minimum statutory funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans may become significant. However, the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations. Payments due under our OPEB plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans. We expect our OPEB payments to approximate $200 million in 2010 net of the benefit of approximately $14 million from the Medicare prescription subsidy. See Note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of our pension and OPEB plans. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Following is a summary of our off-balance sheet arrangements: Guarantees We have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at December 31, 2009: ##TABLE_START      Maximum Potential Future Payments   (Dollars in millions) Operating lease residual values   $   Other third parties financing    4  Unconsolidated affiliates financing    30  Customer financing    16       $      ##TABLE_END We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination, if any, existing on the date of disposition. Such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Retained Interests in Factored Pools of Trade Accounts Receivables As a source of liquidity, we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. The sold receivables ($500 million at December 31, 2008) are over-collateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that over-collateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools. The over-collateralization provides credit support to the purchasers of the receivable interest by limiting their losses in the event that a portion of the receivables sold becomes uncollectible. In April 2009, we modified the terms of the trade accounts receivable program to permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion. This modification provides additional flexibility in the management of the receivable portfolio and also requires the receivables in the program to remain on the Company balance sheet. As a result, $500 million of program receivables were reflected as Accounts, notes and other receivables with a corresponding amount recorded as Short-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These short-term borrowings were repaid as of December 31, 2009. Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly, with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters. It is our policy (see Note 1 to the financial statements) to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. Remedial response and voluntary cleanup payments were $318, $320 and $267 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are currently estimated to be approximately $285 million in 2010. We expect to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow. Remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were $151, $466 and $230 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the recorded liabilities for environmental matters was $779 and $946 million, respectively. In addition, in 2009 and 2008 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $73 and $69 million, respectively, relating to compliance with environmental regulations. Although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. See Note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies, including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation. Financial Instruments As a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. A summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in Note 1 to the financial statements. We also hold investments in marketable equity securities, which exposes us to market volatility, as discussed in Note 16 to the financial statements. We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade. Our objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency cash flows. We attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties. Our principal currency exposures relate to the U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Mexican peso, Swiss franc, Czech koruna, Chinese renminbi, Indian rupee, and Singapore dollar. Our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our net debt and pension obligations. As described in Notes 14 and 16 to the financial statements, we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs. Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and expected future cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. The following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one-percentage-point increase in interest rates across all maturities, the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities, and the potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent decrease in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities at December 31, 2009 and 2008. ##TABLE_START            Face or Notional Amount  Carrying Value(1)  Fair Value(1)  Estimated Increase (Decrease) In Fair Value   (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2009         Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments         Long-term debt (including current maturities)   $  (7,264 )    $  (7,262 )    $  (7,677 )    $  (421 )  Interest rate swap agreements    600     (2 )     (2 )     (23 )  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments         Foreign currency exchange contracts(2)    2,959     8     8     79  Commodity Price Sensitive Instruments         Forward commodity contracts(3)    52     4     4     (10 )  December 31, 2008         Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments         Long-term debt (including current maturities)   $  (6,888 )    $  (6,888 )    $  (7,082 )    $  (354 )  Interest rate swap agreements                     Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments         Foreign currency exchange contracts(2)    3,030     (27 )     (27 )     126  Commodity Price Sensitive Instruments         Forward commodity contracts(3)    8     (4 )     (4 )     (1 )  ##TABLE_END 43  ##TABLE_START (1)    Asset or (liability).

Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. The methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and our Independent Registered Public Accountants. New accounting standards effective in 2009 which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements are described in the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section in Note 1 to the financial statements. Contingent Liabilities We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities. These contingencies primarily relate to product liabilities (including asbestos), contractual matters, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. For a discussion of our contingencies related to environmental, asbestos and other matters, including managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities, see Notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements. Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries We are a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos (refractory and friction products). We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrue for pending claims based on terms and conditions, including evidentiary requirements, in definitive agreements or agreements in principle with current claimants. We also accrued for the probable value of future NARCO asbestos related claims through 2018 based on the disease criteria and payment values contained in the NARCO trust as described in Note 21 to the financial statements. In light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections regarding claims filing rates and disease manifestation, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrue for the estimated value of pending claims based on expected claim resolution values and historic dismissal rates. We also accrue for the estimated cost of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on our assessment of additional claims that may be brought against us and anticipated resolution values in the tort system. We value Bendix pending and future claims using the average resolution values for the previous four years. We will continue to update the expected resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future Bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year. For additional information see Note 21 to the financial statements. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers, our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers, various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers. At December 31, 2009, we have recorded insurance receivables of $831 million that can be specifically allocated to NARCO related asbestos liabilities. We also have $1.9 billion in coverage remaining for Bendix related asbestos liabilities although there are gaps in our coverage due to insurance company insolvencies, certain uninsured periods and insurance settlements. Our insurance is with both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. See Note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We maintain defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our employees and retirees. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historic and expected plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations (see Note 22 to the financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. Further information on all our major actuarial assumption is included in Note 22 to the financial statements. The key assumptions used in developing our 2009, 2008 and 2007 net periodic pension expense for our U.S. plans included the following: ##TABLE_START          2009  2008  2007 Discount rate    6.95 %     6.50 %     6.00 %  Assets:       Expected rate of return    9 %     9 %     9 %  Actual rate of return    20 %     (29 %)     9 %  Actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return    4 %     4 %     9 %  ##TABLE_END The discount rate can be volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We will use a 5.75 percent discount rate in 2010, reflecting the decrease in the market interest rate environment since December 31, 2008. We plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 9 percent for 2010 as this is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations. The net losses for our pension plans were $7.6 billion at December 31, 2009 compared with $6.0 billion at December 31, 2008. This increase of $1.6 billion is due primarily to lower discount rates in our plans partially offset by asset gains due to the performance of the equity markets in 2009. The net losses at December 31, 2009 principally result from lower discount rates in 2009 and actual plan asset returns below expected rates of return in 2008. As discussed in detail in Note 22 to the financial statements such losses have been recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. In the future we will continue to systematically recognize such net losses in net periodic pension expense. We use the market-related value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a three-year period. Further, net losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor) are recognized over a six-year period. Changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant: ##TABLE_START      Change in Assumption  Impact on Annual Pension Expense  Impact on PBO 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate  Increase $50 million  Increase $350 million 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate  Decrease $50 million  Decrease $350 million 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets  Increase $27 million   0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets  Decrease $27 million   ##TABLE_END Net periodic pension expense for our pension plans is expected to be approximately $820 million in 2010, a $712 million increase from 2009 due principally to an increase in the amortization of net losses in our U.S. plans. The increase in the amortization of net losses results principally from asset losses due to the poor performance of the equity markets in 2008. In 2009, 2008 and 2007 we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our U.S. pension plans. However, we made voluntary contributions of $740, $242 and $42 million to our U.S. pension plans in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, primarily to improve the funded status of our plans which deteriorated during 2008 due to the significant asset losses resulting from the poor performance of the equity markets. During 2010, we plan to make additional voluntary contributions of Honeywell common stock to our U.S. plans to improve the funded status of our plans. Beyond 2010, minimum statutory funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans may become significant. However, the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. We also expect to contribute approximately $150 to our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2010 to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Long-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets) To conduct our global business operations and execute our business strategy, we acquire tangible and intangible assets, including property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets. At December 31, 2009, the net carrying amount of these long-lived assets totaled $6.6 billion. The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not these assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review are as follows: ##TABLE_START     significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations;     annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line;     significant negative industry or economic trends; and ##TABLE_END 46 ##TABLE_START     significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. ##TABLE_END Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 in the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates, our assumptions as to volume, selling prices and costs, and the discount rate selected. As described in more detail in Note 16 to the financial statements, we have recorded impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $28 and $78 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment in facilities scheduled to close or be downsized. Goodwill Impairment Testing Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing. Our Goodwill balance, $10.5 billion as of December 31, 2009, is subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value is reduced to fair value. The fair value of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. This impairment test involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions. We completed our annual impairment test as of March 31, 2009 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. Given the significant changes in the business climate and decline in mid-range forecasts for certain of our reporting units we re-tested goodwill for impairment in the second half of 2009. No impairment was indicated by this interim test. However, significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances, including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions. As of December 31, 2009, we recognized a net deferred tax asset of $3,028 million, less a valuation allowance of $578 million. Net deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of net deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods. The determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. The projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs. Additionally, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws. Our net deferred tax asset of $3,028 million is comprised of $2,132 million related to U.S. operations and $896 million related to non-U.S. operations. The U.S. net deferred tax asset of $2,132 million is comprised of net deductible temporary differences, tax credit carryforwards and state tax net operating losses which we believe will more likely than not be realized through the generation of future taxable income in the U.S. and tax planning strategies. We maintain a valuation allowance of $8 million against such asset related to state net operating losses. The non-U.S. net deferred tax asset of $896 million is comprised principally of net operating and capital loss carryforwards, mainly in Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and the United Kingdom. We maintain a valuation allowance of $570 million against these deferred tax assets reflecting our historical experience and lower expectations of taxable income over the applicable carryforward periods. As more fully described in Note 6 to the financial statements, our valuation allowance increased by $133 million in 2009 and decreased by $45 million and $26 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income in the period that such determination is made. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, as defined by the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Sales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts In 2009, we recognized approximately 15 percent of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts in our Automation and Control Solutions, Aerospace and Specialty Materials segments. These long-term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting Principles The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is a description of the significant accounting policies of Honeywell International Inc. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. Our consolidation policy requires the consolidation of entities where a controlling financial interest is obtained as well as consolidation of variable interest entities in which we bear a majority of the risk to the entities potential losses or stand to gain from a majority of the entities expected returns. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit and highly liquid, temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out or the average cost method and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for certain qualifying domestic inventories. Investments Investments in affiliates over which we have a significant influence, but not a controlling interest, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Other investments are carried at market value, if readily determinable, or at cost. All equity investments are periodically reviewed to determine if declines in fair value below cost basis are other-than-temporary. Significant and sustained decreases in quoted market prices or a series of historic and projected operating losses by investees are strong indicators of other-than-temporary declines. If the decline in fair value is determined to be other- than-temporary, an impairment loss is recorded and the investment is written down to a new carrying value. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding assets useful life. See Note 11 and Note 17 for additional details. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2009 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. See Note 12 for additional details on goodwill balances. Other Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years. Long-Lived Assets We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with determinable lives) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate events or changes in circumstances based on a number of factors including operating results, business plans and forecasts, general and industry trends and, economic HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) projections and anticipated cash flows. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in earnings. We also continually evaluate the estimated useful lives of all long-lived assets and periodically revise such estimates based on current events. Sales Recognition Product and service sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities in our Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments, are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts in the Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments are recorded on a percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident. Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis. Amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses as a result of customers inability to make required payments. We estimate anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on days past due, as measured from the contractual due date, historical collection history and incorporate changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in historical trends for example, customers in bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization. Receivables are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are determined uncollectible. Such determination includes analysis and consideration of the particular conditions of the account, including time intervals since last collection, success of outside collection agencies activity, solvency of customer and any bankruptcy proceedings. Environmental Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and that do not provide future benefits, are expensed as incurred. Liabilities are recorded when environmental remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries Honeywell is a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos (refractory and friction products). We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrue for pending claims based on terms and conditions, including evidentiary requirements, in definitive agreements or agreements in principle with current claimants. We also accrue for the probable value of future NARCO asbestos related claims through 2018 based on the disease criteria and payment values contained in the NARCO trust as described in Note 21. In light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections regarding claims filing rates and disease manifestation, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2018. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrue for the estimated value of pending claims based on expected claim resolution values and historic dismissal rates. We also accrue for the estimated cost of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on our assessment of additional claims that may be brought against us and anticipated resolution values in the tort system. We value Bendix pending and future claims using average resolution values for the previous four years. We will continue to update the expected resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future Bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year. For additional information see Note 21. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers, our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers, various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers. Aerospace Sales Incentives We provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of our aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and braking system hardware and auxiliary power units, for installation on commercial aircraft. These incentives principally consist of free or deeply discounted products, but also include credits for future purchases of product and upfront cash payments. These costs are recognized in the period incurred as cost of products sold or as a reduction to sales, as appropriate. For aircraft manufacturers, incentives are recorded when the products are delivered; for airlines, incentives are recorded when the associated aircraft are delivered by the aircraft manufacturer to the airline. Research and Development Research and development costs for company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred. Such costs are principally included in Cost of Products Sold and were $1,330, $1,543 and $1,459 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Plans The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 20, include non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs). The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant in order to estimate the portion of the award that will ultimately vest. The estimate is based on our historical rates of forfeiture. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage to eligible retirees. For our U.S. defined benefit pension plans we use the market-related value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a three-year period. Further, net actuarial (gains) or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor) are recognized over a six-year period. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings. Derivative Financial Instruments As a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract. All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. Transfers of Financial Instruments Sales, transfers and securitization of financial instruments are accounted for under authoritative guidance for the transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities. We sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. The receivables are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the time they are sold. The value assigned to our subordinated interests and undivided interests retained in trade receivables sold is based on the relative fair values of the interests retained and sold. The carrying value of the retained interests approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the collection period for the receivables. Income Taxes Deferred tax liabilities or assets reflect temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting. Such amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the amount of a valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. The projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs. Additionally, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, as defined by the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Federal, State and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which establishes a single model to address accounting for uncertain tax positions. The guidance clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. The guidance also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Upon adoption as of January 1, 2007, we reduced our existing reserves for uncertain tax positions by $33 million, largely related to a reduction in state income tax matters, partially offset by a net increase for federal and international tax reserves. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance on fair value measurements. This guidance establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to U.S. GAAP requiring use of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. It is effective for financial assets and financial liabilities for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Issued in February 2008, a FASB staff position removed leasing transactions from the scope of the new fair value guidance. Also in February 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance deferring the effective date of the fair value guidance for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. In September 2009, the FASB issued additional guidance on measuring the fair value of liabilities effective for the first reporting period (including interim periods) beginning after issuance. Implementation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. The implementation of the fair value guidance for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, effective January 1, 2009, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. See Note 16 for additional fair value information and disclosure for financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities. In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance on business combinations. The new standard provides revised guidance on how acquirors recognize and measure the consideration transferred, identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill acquired in a business combination. The new standard also expands required disclosures surrounding the nature and financial effects of business combinations. The standard is effective, on a prospective basis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Upon adoption, this standard did not have a material HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. However, if the Company enters into any business combinations after the adoption of the new guidance on business combinations, a transaction may significantly impact the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations as compared to the Companys recent acquisitions, accounted for under prior GAAP requirements, due to the changes described above. In April 2009, the FASB issued a staff position amending and clarifying the new business combination standard to address application issues associated with initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination. The staff position is effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance on noncontrolling interests which establishes requirements for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the Company (sometimes called minority interests) be clearly identified, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parents equity. All changes in the parents ownership interests are required to be accounted for consistently as equity transactions and any noncontrolling equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries must be measured initially at fair value. The new guidance is effective, on a prospective basis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. However, presentation and disclosure requirements must be retrospectively applied to comparative financial statements. Upon adoption of the new guidance on noncontrolling interest the Company reclassified $82 million and $71 million of noncontrolling interest from other liabilities to noncontrolling interest as a separate component of shareholders equity in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively and $20 million and $16 million of noncontrolling interest expense to net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in our statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. See statement of shareholders equity for additional disclosures regarding noncontrolling interest components of other comprehensive income. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In November 2008, the FASB ratified an issue providing guidance for accounting for defensive intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition in accordance with the new business combination and fair value standards, including the estimated useful life that should be assigned to such assets. The new guidance is effective for intangible assets acquired on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In April 2009, the FASB issued a staff position which changes the method for determining whether an other-than-temporary impairment exists for debt securities and the amount of the impairment to be recorded in earnings. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In May 2009, the FASB issued new guidance on subsequent events. The standard provides guidance on managements assessment of subsequent events and incorporates this guidance into accounting literature. The standard is effective prospectively for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. The Company has evaluated subsequent events through February 12, 2010, the date of issuance of our consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets. The guidance requires additional disclosures for transfers of financial HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) assets and changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities. The guidance affects the overall consolidation analysis and requires enhanced disclosures on involvement with variable interest entities. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In October 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the accounting and disclosure for revenue recognition. These amendments, effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 (early adoption is permitted), modify the criteria for recognizing revenue in multiple element arrangements and the scope of what constitutes a non-software deliverable. The Company has elected to early adopt this guidance, on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after January 1, 2010. The implementation of this amended accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Note 2Acquisitions and Divestitures We acquired businesses for an aggregate cost of $468, $2,181 and $1,190 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For all of our acquisitions the acquired businesses were recorded at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Significant acquisitions made in these years are discussed below. In August 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of the RMG Group (RMG Regel + Messtechnik GmbH), a natural gas measuring and control products, services and integrated solutions company, for a purchase price of approximately $416 million, net of cash acquired. The purchase price for the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The Company has assigned $174 million to identifiable intangible assets, predominantly customer relationships, existing technology and trademarks. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives using straight-line and accelerated amortization methods. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired (approximating $225 million), was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is non- deductible for tax purposes. This acquisition was accounted for by the acquisition method, and, accordingly, results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2009 are included in the Automation and Control Solutions segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2009, the purchase accounting for the RMG Group is still subject to adjustment primarily for useful lives of intangible assets, amounts allocated to intangible assets and goodwill, and for certain pre- acquisition contingencies. In May 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of Safety Products Holding, Inc, which through its subsidiary Norcross Safety Products L.L.C. (Norcross) is a leading manufacturer of personal protective equipment. The purchase price, net of cash acquired, was approximately $1.2 billion and was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date. ##TABLE_START    Accounts and other receivables   $   Inventories    118  Other current assets    28  Property, plant and equipment    65  Intangible assets    702  Other assets and deferred charges    3  Accounts payable    (27 )  Accrued liabilities    (74 )  Deferred income taxes    (274 )  Other long-term liabilities    (26 )     Net assets acquired    617  Goodwill    604     Purchase price   $  1,221     ##TABLE_END The Company has assigned $702 million to intangible assets, predominantly customer relationships, trade names, and technology. These intangibles assets are being amortized over their estimated lives using straight line and accelerated amortization methods. The value assigned to the trade names of approximately $257 million is classified as an indefinite lived intangible. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired (approximately $604 million) was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. This acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method, and, accordingly, results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2008 are included in the Automation and Control Solutions segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. In July 2008, the Company completed the sale of its Consumables Solutions business to B/E Aerospace (B/E) for $1.05 billion, consisting of approximately $901 million in cash and six million shares of B/E common stock. In connection with the completion of the sale, the Company and B/E entered into, among other things, exclusive supply and license agreements and a stockholder agreement. Because of the extent of the Companys cash flows associated with the supply and license agreements, the Consumables Solutions business is not classified as discontinued operations. The provisions of the license and supply agreements were determined to be at-market. As such, we have not allocated any portion of the proceeds to these agreements. The pre-tax gain of $623 million was classified as Other (Income)/Expense in our Statement of Operations. The gain on sale was approximately $417 million net of tax. The sale of the Consumables Solutions business, within the Aerospace segment, is consistent with the Companys strategic focus on core product areas utilizing advanced technologies. In July 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of Metrologic Instruments, Inc. (Metrologic), a leading manufacturer of data capture and collection hardware and software, for a purchase price of approximately $715 million, net of cash acquired. The purchase price for the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at acquisition date. The Company has assigned $248 million to identifiable intangible assets, predominantly customer relationships, technology and trademarks. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives which range from 1-15 years using straight line and accelerated amortization methods. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired (approximately $440 million) was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. This acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method, and, accordingly, results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) acquisition.

The Company has assigned $70 million to identifiable intangible assets, predominantly customer relationships and trademarks. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives which range from 7-20 years using straight line and accelerated amortization methods. The value assigned to the trade marks of approximately $10 million is classified as an indefinite lived intangible. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired approximating $114 million, was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. This acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method, and, accordingly, results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2007 were not material to the consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the Company, specifically the Automation and Control Solutions segment, completed the acquisition of Hand Held Products, Inc. a privately held automatic identification and data collection company, for a purchase price of approximately $390 million.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) In 2009, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $224 million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 4,423 manufacturing and administrative positions mainly in our Automation and Control Solutions, Transportation Systems and Aerospace segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to the adverse market conditions experienced by many of our businesses, cost savings actions taken in connection with our ongoing functional transformation initiative, the planned downsizing or shutdown of certain manufacturing facilities, and organizational realignments of portions of our Aerospace and Transportation Systems segments. Also, $53 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance at our Automation and Control Solutions, Aerospace, and Transportation Systems segments, were returned to income in 2009 due to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with prior severance programs and changes in the scope of previously announced repositioning actions. In 2008, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $444 million including severance costs of $333 million related to workforce reductions of 7,480 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our segments. The workforce reductions primarily relate to the planned downsizing or shutdown of certain manufacturing facilities in our Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions and Transportation Systems segments, the rationalization of non-manufacturing infrastructure, outsourcing of non-core components, managing capacity utilization to address product demand volatility and our functional transformation initiative. The repositioning charge also included asset impairments of $78 million principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment in facilities scheduled to close or be downsized and certain administrative facilities, and information technology equipment in our Corporate segment. Also, $20 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance at our Automation and Control Solutions segment were returned to income in 2008 due mainly to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with prior severance programs. In 2007, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $209 million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 3,408 manufacturing and administrative positions mainly in our Automation and Control Solutions and Aerospace segments. Also, $18 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance at our Transportation Systems and Aerospace segments, were returned to income in 2007 due mainly to changes in the scope of previously announced severance programs and due to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with prior severance programs.

Deferred tax assets (liabilities) Deferred income taxes represent the future tax effects of transactions which are reported in different periods for tax and financial reporting purposes. The tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which give rise to future income tax benefits and payables are as follows: HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

The use of pre-acquisition operating losses is subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. We do not anticipate that these limitations will affect utilization of the carryforwards prior to their expiration. The Company has state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $2.8 billion at December 31, 2009 with varying expiration dates through 2024. We also have foreign net operating and capital losses of $2.8 billion which are available to reduce future income tax payments in several countries, subject to varying expiration rules. We have state tax credit carryforwards of $58 million at December 31, 2009, including carryforwards of $32 million with various expiration dates through 2024 and tax credits of $26 million which are not subject to expiration. The valuation allowance against deferred tax assets increased by $133 million in 2009 and decreased by $45 million and $26 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2009 increase in the valuation allowance was primarily due to increased foreign net operating losses related to Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. The 2008 decrease in the valuation allowance was primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance related to federal and state capital loss carryforwards partially offset by increased foreign net operating losses. The 2007 decrease in the valuation allowance was primarily due to a decrease in valuation allowances related to state and foreign net operating losses partially offset by a valuation allowance against U.S. capital losses. Federal income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of the majority of our international subsidiaries as it is our intention to reinvest these earnings into the respective subsidiaries. At December 31, 2009 Honeywell has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $5.1 billion of such earnings of our non-U.S. operations. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and foreign tax credits would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability. We had $720 million, $671 million and $666 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively. If recognized, $720 million would be recorded as a component of income tax expense as of December 31, 2009. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company increased its unrecognized tax benefits by $49 million and $5 million, respectively, due to additional reserves for various international and U.S. tax audit matters, partially offset by adjustments related to our ongoing assessments of the likelihood and amount of potential outcomes of current and future examinations, the expiration of various statute of limitations, and settlements with tax authorities. The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits: HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

In addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods. Based on the number of tax years currently under audit by the relevant U.S federal, state and foreign tax authorities, the Company anticipates that several of these audits may be finalized in the foreseeable future. However, based on the status of these examinations, the protocol of finalizing audits by the relevant taxing authorities, and the possibility that the Company might challenge certain audit findings (which could include formal legal proceedings) at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact of any amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits for the above listed examinations in progress were $261 million, $249 million and $199 million, as of December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. These increases are primarily due to an increase in tax examinations and fewer settlements during the year. Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of Tax Expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and totaled $13 million, $19 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively. Accrued interest and penalties were $150 million, $137 million and $118 million, as of December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

These amounts are billed in accordance with the terms of the customer contracts to which they relate. We sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. The sold receivables ($500 million at December 31, 2008) were over-collateralized and we retained a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that over-collateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools. The over-collateralization provides credit support to the purchasers of the receivable interest by limiting their losses in the event that a portion of the receivables sold becomes uncollectible. In April 2009, we modified the terms of the trade accounts receivable program to permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion. This modification provides additional flexibility in the management of the receivable portfolio and also requires the receivables in the program to remain on the Company balance sheet. As a result, $500 million of program receivables were reflected as Accounts, notes and other receivables with a corresponding amount recorded as Short-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These short-term borrowings were repaid as of December 31, 2009. This modification also results in the HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the quantity of inventory valued using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method in our Specialty Materials segment declined. This reduction resulted in a liquidation of LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared with the cost of 2009 purchases, the effect of which decreased cost of products sold by $12 million during the year ended December 31, 2009.

The $2.8 billion credit facility is maintained for general corporate purposes, including support for the issuance of commercial paper. We had no borrowings outstanding or letters of credit issued under the credit facility at December 31, 2009. The credit agreement does not restrict our ability to pay dividends and contains no financial covenants. The failure to comply with customary conditions or the occurrence of customary events default contained in the credit agreement would prevent any further borrowings and would generally require the repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement. Such events of default include: (a) non-payment of credit agreement debt, interest or fees; (b) non-compliance with the terms of the credit agreement covenants; (c) cross-default to other debt in certain circumstances; (d) bankruptcy; and (e) defaults upon obligations under Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Additionally, each of the banks has the right to terminate its commitment to lend additional funds or issue letters of credit under the agreement if any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 30 percent or more of our voting stock, or, during any 12-month period, individuals who were directors of Honeywell at the beginning of the period cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors (the Board). Loans under the credit facility are required to be repaid no later than May 14, 2012. We have agreed to pay a facility fee of 0.05 percent per annum on the aggregate commitment. Interest on borrowings under the credit facility would be determined, at Honeywells option, by (a) an auction bidding procedure; (b) the highest of the floating base rate publicly announced by Citibank, N.A., 0.5 percent above the average CD rate, or 0.5 percent above the Federal funds rate; or (c) the Eurocurrency rate plus 0.15 percent (applicable margin). The facility fee, the applicable margin over the Eurocurrency rate and the letter of credit issuance fee, are subject to change, based upon a grid determined by our long term debt ratings. The credit agreement is not subject to termination based upon a decrease in our debt ratings or a material adverse change. In February 2009, the Company issued $600 million 3.875% Senior Notes due 2014 and $900 million 5.00% Senior Notes due 2019 (collectively, the 2009 Senior Notes). The 2009 Senior Notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywells existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of Honeywells subordinated debt. The offering resulted in gross proceeds of $1.5 billion, offset by $12 million in discount and issuance costs. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) In the first quarter of 2009, the Company repaid $493 million of its floating rate notes. In the third quarter of 2009, the Company repaid $500 million of its floating rate notes and $100 million of its zero coupon bonds and money multiplier notes. Note 15Lease Commitments Future minimum lease payments under operating leases having initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows: ##TABLE_START      At December 31, 2009   $   2011    245  2012    174  2013    125  2014    100  Thereafter    256       $  1,213     ##TABLE_END We have entered into agreements to lease land, equipment and buildings. Principally all our operating leases have initial terms of up to 25 years, and some contain renewal options subject to customary conditions. At any time during the terms of some of our leases, we may at our option purchase the leased assets for amounts that approximate fair value. We do not expect that any of our commitments under the lease agreements will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Rent expense was $371, $383 and $365 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Note 16Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Credit and Market Risk Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers. Foreign Currency Risk Management We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. Our objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency denominated cash flows. We attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts with third parties. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) We hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in Other (Income) Expense. We partially hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which predominantly occur in the next twelve months and are denominated in non-functional currencies, with currency forward contracts. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the currency forward contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. Open foreign currency exchange forward contracts mature predominantly in the next twelve months. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had contracts with notional amounts of $2,959 and $3,030 million, respectively to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Mexican peso, Swiss franc, Czech koruna, Chinese renminbi, Indian rupee and Singapore dollar. Commodity Price Risk Management Our exposure to market risk for commodity prices can result in changes in our cost of production. We primarily mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk through the use of long-term, fixed-price contracts with our suppliers and formula price agreements with suppliers and customers. We also enter into forward commodity contracts with third parties designated as hedges of anticipated purchases of several commodities. Forward commodity contracts are marked-to-market, with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had contracts with notional amounts of $52 and $8 million, respectively, related to forward commodity agreements, principally base metals and natural gas. Interest Rate Risk Management We use a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. At December 31, 2009, interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively changed $600 million of fixed rate debt at a rate of 3.875 percent to LIBOR based floating debt. Our interest rate swaps mature in 2014. At December 31, 2008, we had no interest rate swap agreements. Fair Value of Financial Instrument The FASBs accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The FASBs guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy: ##TABLE_START    Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or   Unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or   Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability Level 3  Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability ##TABLE_END The Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company has determined that our financial assets and HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) liabilities are level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2009 and 2008: ##TABLE_START        December 31,  2009  2008 Assets:     Foreign currency exchange contracts   $     $   Available for sale investments    141     23  Interest rate swap agreements    1       Forward commodity contracts    4       Liabilities:     Foreign currency exchange contracts   $     $   Interest rate swap agreements    3       Forward commodity contracts         4  ##TABLE_END The foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate swap agreements, and forward commodity contracts are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds investments in marketable equity securities that are designated as available for sale and are valued using market transactions in over-the-counter markets. As such, these investments are classified within level 2. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were not carried at fair value: ##TABLE_START            December 31,  2009  2008  Carrying Value  Fair Value  Carrying Value  Fair Value Assets:         Long-term receivables   $     $     $     $   Cost method marketable equity securities              74     18  Liabilities:         Long-term debt and related current maturities.   $  7,262    $  7,677    $  6,888    $  7,082  ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2009, the Company had assets with a net book value of $72 million, specifically property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which were accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets were tested for impairment and based on the fair value of these assets the Company recognized losses of $28 million in 2009. The Company has determined that the fair value measurements of these nonfinancial assets are level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company holds investments in marketable equity securities that are designated as available for sale securities. The Company considers duration of the unrealized loss position, stability of the liquidity positions and financial conditions of the investees, and the Companys intent and ability to hold these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value, in determining other than temporary impairments. As a result of an other-than-temporary decline in fair value of these investments, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $62 million in the second quarter of 2009 that is included in Other (Income) Expense. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The derivatives utilized for risk management purposes as detailed above are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and impacted the Statement of Operations as follows: Fair value of asset derivatives consist of the following: ##TABLE_START        Designated as a Hedge  Balance Sheet Location  December 31,  2009  2008 Foreign currency exchange contracts  Accounts, notes and other receivables   $   8    $   2  Interest rate swap agreements  Other assets    1       Commodity contracts  Accounts, notes and other receivables    4       ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START        Not Designated as a Hedge  Balance Sheet Location     Foreign currency exchange contracts  Accounts notes and other receivables   $   3    $   5  ##TABLE_END Fair value of liability derivatives consist of the following: ##TABLE_START        Designated as a Hedge  Balance Sheet Location  December 31,  2009  2008 Foreign currency exchange contracts  Accrued liabilities   $   1    $   19  Interest rate swap agreements  Accrued liabilities    3       Commodity contracts  Accrued liabilities         4  Not Designated as a Hedge  Balance Sheet Location            Foreign currency exchange contracts  Accrued liabilities   $     $   ##TABLE_END Gains (losses) recognized in OCI consist of the following: ##TABLE_START    Designated as a Cash Flow Hedge  December 31, 2009 Foreign currency exchange contracts   $   18  Commodity contracts    (1 )  ##TABLE_END Gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI to income (Effective Portions) consist of the following: ##TABLE_START      Designated as a Cash Flow Hedge  Income Statement Location  December 31,  2009 Foreign currency exchange contracts  Product sales   $     Cost of products sold    (44 )   Selling general and administrative    (1 )  Commodity contracts  Cost of products sold    (7 )  ##TABLE_END Ineffective portions of commodity derivative instruments designated in cash flow hedge relationships were less than $1 million in 2009 and are located in cost of products sold. Foreign currency exchange contracts in cash flow hedge relationships qualify as critical matched terms hedge relationships and as a result have no ineffectiveness. Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or (losses) on the derivative recognized in Interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt being hedged. Losses on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $2 million in 2009. These losses were fully off-set by gains on the underlying debt being hedged. We also economically hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts. These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses similarly recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized $85 million of expense in Other (income) expense. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Common shareowners do not have preemptive or conversion rights. Shares of common stock issued and outstanding or held in the treasury are not liable to further calls or assessments. There are no restrictions on us relative to dividends or the repurchase or redemption of common stock. Under the Companys previously reported $3.0 billion share repurchase program, $1.3 billion remained available as of December 31, 2009 for additional share repurchases. The amount and timing of repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating and other investing activities. We are authorized to issue up to 40,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value, and can determine the number of shares of each series, and the rights, preferences and limitations of each series.

Under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (the Plan), a maximum of 43 million shares of Honeywell common stock may be awarded. Additionally, under the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (the Directors Plan) 500,000 shares of Honeywell common stock may be awarded. Stock Options The exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under our stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of our stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employees requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Honeywell common stock. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The expected term represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Compensation cost on a pre-tax basis related to stock options recognized in operating results (included in selling, general and administrative expenses) in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $39, $51 and $65 million, respectively. The associated future income tax benefit recognized in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $13, $19 and $25 million, respectively. The following table sets forth fair value per share information, including related weighted-average assumptions, used to determine compensation cost: ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2009  2008  2007 Weighted average fair value per share of options granted during the year(1)   $  6.73    $  13.81    $  10.27  Assumptions:       Expected annual dividend yield    4.26 %     1.88 %     2.09 %  Expected volatility    35.78 %     26.35 %     20.18 %  Risk-free rate of return    2.53 %     3.09 %     4.66 %  Expected option term (years)    5.8     5.2     5.3  ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1)    Estimated on date of grant using Black-Scholes option-pricing model. ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes information about stock option activity for the three years ended December 31, 2009: ##TABLE_START        Number of Options  Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at December 31, 2006    54,232,677    $  39.98  Granted    5,963,500     47.59  Exercised    (16,037,530 )     36.95  Lapsed or canceled    (2,761,278 )     45.74       Outstanding at December 31, 2007    41,397,369     41.88  Granted    5,024,820     58.46  Exercised    (3,577,707 )     37.40  Lapsed or canceled    (1,910,960 )     49.16       Outstanding at December 31, 2008    40,933,522     43.97       Granted    9,159,650     28.40  Exercised    (645,201 )     31.66  Lapsed or canceled    (8,537,598 )     53.90       Outstanding at December 31, 2009    40,910,373    $  38.58       Vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2009(1)    38,189,089    $  38.82       Exercisable at December 31, 2009    27,427,023    $  38.85       ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1)    The expected to vest options are the result of applying the pre-vesting forfeiture rate assumption to total outstanding options. ##TABLE_END 81 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

There were 30,000,541 shares available for future grants under the terms of our stock option plans at December 31, 2009. The total intrinsic value of options (which is the amount by which the stock price exceeded the exercise price of the options on the date of exercise) exercised during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $4, $76 and $281 million, respectively. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $20, $134 and $592 million, respectively, with an associated tax benefit realized of $1, $28 and $101 million, respectively. In 2009, 2008 and 2007 we classified $1, $21 and $86 million, respectively, of this benefit as a financing cash inflow in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and the balance was classified as cash from operations. At December 31, 2009, there was $82 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock option awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.49 years. The total fair value of options vested during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $51, $63 and $83 million, respectively. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock unit (RSU) awards entitle the holder to receive one share of common stock for each unit when the units vest. RSUs are issued to certain key employees at fair market value at the date of grant as compensation. RSUs typically become fully vested over periods ranging from three to seven years and are payable in Honeywell common stock upon vesting. The following table summarizes information about RSU activity for the three years ended December 31, 2009: ##TABLE_START        Number of Restricted Stock Units  Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Non-vested at December 31, 2006    4,751,999    $  35.85  Granted    1,980,850     54.47  Vested    (372,105 )     32.48  Forfeited    (503,747 )     37.93       Non-vested at December 31, 2007    5,856,997     42.18  Granted    2,087,934     54.56  Vested    (694,660 )     35.82  Forfeited    (424,554 )     41.94       Non-vested at December 31, 2008    6,825,717     46.63  Granted    3,691,129     30.16  Vested    (1,313,975 )     40.44  Forfeited    (940,094 )     44.51       Non-vested at December 31, 2009    8,262,777    $  40.49       ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2009, there was approximately $167 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs granted under our stock plans which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years. Compensation expense related to RSUs was $79, $77 and $47 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Non-Employee Directors Plan Under the Directors Plan each new director receives a one-time grant of 3,000 restricted stock units that will vest on the fifth anniversary of continuous Board service. The Directors Plan also provides for an annual grant to each director of options to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock at the fair market value on the date of grant. Options generally become exercisable over a four-year period and expire after ten years. Note 21Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded liabilities for environmental costs: ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2009  2008  2007 Beginning of year   $     $     $   Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable    151     466     230  Environmental liability payments    (318 )     (320 )     (267 )  Other adjustments         1     5         End of year   $     $     $          ##TABLE_END See Note 3, Repositioning and Other Charges, for more detail regarding accruals for environmental matters during 2009.

However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that these environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. New Jersey Chrome Sites The excavation and offsite disposal of approximately one million tons of chromium residue present at a predecessor Honeywell site located in Jersey City, New Jersey, known as Study Area 7 was completed in January 2010. We have also received approval of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey for the implementation of related groundwater and sediment remedial actions, and are seeking the appropriate permits from state and federal agencies. Provisions have been made in our financial statements for the estimated cost of these remedies. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The above-referenced site is the most significant of the twenty-one sites located in Hudson County, New Jersey that are the subject of an Administrative Consent Order (ACO) entered into with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) in 1993 (the Honeywell ACO Sites). Remedial investigations and activities consistent with the ACO have also been conducted and are underway at the other Honeywell ACO Sites. We have recorded reserves for the Honeywell ACO Sites where appropriate under the accounting policy described above. On May 3, 2005, NJDEP filed a lawsuit in New Jersey Superior Court against Honeywell and two other companies seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages, and the reimbursement of unspecified total costs relating to sites in New Jersey allegedly contaminated with chrome ore processing residue. The claims against Honeywell relate to the activities of a predecessor company which ceased its New Jersey manufacturing operations in the mid-1950s. Honeywell and the two other companies have agreed to settle this litigation with NJDEP, subject to Court approval. Under the settlement, Honeywell would pay $5 million of NJDEPs past costs, as well as accept sole responsibility to remediate 24 of the 53 Publicly Funded Sites (i.e., those sites for which none of the three companies had previously accepted responsibility). Honeywell would also bear 50% of the costs at another 10 Publicly Funded Sites. We have recorded reserves for the Publicly Funded Sites where appropriate under the accounting policy described above. We have entered into court-approved settlements of litigation filed in federal court against Honeywell and other landowners seeking the cleanup of chrome residue at groups of properties known as Study Areas 5, 6 South and 6 North of the Honeywell ACO Sites. The required remedial actions are consistent with our recorded reserves. Dundalk Marine Terminal, Baltimore Chrome residue from legacy chrome plant operations in Baltimore was deposited as fill at the Dundalk Marine Terminal (DMT), which is owned and operated by the Maryland Port Administration (MPA). Honeywell and the MPA have been sharing costs to investigate and mitigate related environmental issues, and have entered into a cost sharing agreement under which Honeywell will bear 77 percent of the costs of developing and implementing permanent remedies for the DMT facility. The investigative phase is ongoing, after which the appropriate remedies will be identified and chosen. We have negotiated a Consent Decree with the MPA and Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) with respect to the investigation and remediation of the DMT facility. The Consent Decree is being challenged in federal court by BUILD, a Baltimore community group, together with a local church and two individuals (collectively BUILD). In October 2007, the Court dismissed with prejudice BUILDs state law claims and dismissed without prejudice BUILDs RCRA claims regarding neighborhoods near the DMT facility. In August 2008, the Court held a hearing on the Companys motion to dismiss BUILDs remaining claims on the grounds that MDE is diligently prosecuting the investigation and remediation of the DMT. We are awaiting the Courts decision. We do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or operating cash flows. Given the scope and complexity of this project, it is possible that the cost of remediation, when determinable, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the periods recognized. Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, NY We are implementing a combined dredging/capping remedy of Onondaga Lake pursuant to a consent decree approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York in January 2007. We have accrued for our estimated cost of remediating Onondaga Lake based on currently available information and analysis performed by our engineering consultants. Honeywell is also conducting remedial investigations and activities at other sites in Syracuse. We have recorded reserves for these investigations and activities where appropriate under the accounting policy described above. Honeywell has entered into a cooperative agreement with potential natural resource trustees to assess alleged natural resource damages relating to this site. It is not possible to predict the outcome or duration of this assessment, or the amounts of, or responsibility for, any damages. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Asbestos Matters Like many other industrial companies, Honeywell is a defendant in personal injury actions related to asbestos. We did not mine or produce asbestos, nor did we make or sell insulation products or other construction materials that have been identified as the primary cause of asbestos related disease in the vast majority of claimants. Products containing asbestos previously manufactured by Honeywell or by previously owned subsidiaries primarily fall into two general categories: refractory products and friction products. Refractory Products Honeywell owned North American Refractories Company (NARCO) from 1979 to 1986. NARCO produced refractory products (high temperature bricks and cement) that were sold largely to the steel industry in the East and Midwest. Less than 2 percent of NARCOS products contained asbestos. When we sold the NARCO business in 1986, we agreed to indemnify NARCO with respect to personal injury claims for products that had been discontinued prior to the sale (as defined in the sale agreement). NARCO retained all liability for all other claims. On January 4, 2002, NARCO filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the NARCO bankruptcy filing, all of the claims pending against NARCO are automatically stayed pending the reorganization of NARCO. In addition, the bankruptcy court enjoined both the filing and prosecution of NARCO-related asbestos claims against Honeywell. The stay has remained in effect continuously since January 4, 2002. In connection with NARCOs bankruptcy filing, we paid NARCOs parent company $40 million and agreed to provide NARCO with up to $20 million in financing. We also agreed to pay $20 million to NARCOs parent company upon the filing of a plan of reorganization for NARCO acceptable to Honeywell (which amount was paid in December 2005 following the filing of NARCOs Third Amended Plan of Reorganization), and to pay NARCOs parent company $40 million, and to forgive any outstanding NARCO indebtedness to Honeywell, upon the effective date of the plan of reorganization. We believe that, as part of the NARCO plan of reorganization, a trust will be established for the benefit of all asbestos claimants, current and future, pursuant to Trust Distribution Procedures negotiated with the NARCO Asbestos Claimants Committee and the Court-appointed legal representative for future asbestos claimants. If the trust is put in place and approved by the Court as fair and equitable, Honeywell as well as NARCO will be entitled to a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based on exposure to NARCO products to be made against the federally-supervised trust. Honeywell has reached agreement with the representative for future NARCO claimants and the Asbestos Claimants Committee to cap its annual contributions to the trust with respect to future claims at a level that would not have a material impact on Honeywells operating cash flows. In November 2007, the Bankruptcy Court entered an amended order confirming the NARCO Plan without modification and approving the 524(g) trust and channeling injunction in favor of NARCO and Honeywell. In December 2007, certain insurers filed an appeal of the Bankruptcy Court Order in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court Order in July 2008. In August 2008, insurers filed a notice of appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal is fully briefed, oral argument took place on May 21, 2009, and the matter has been submitted for decision. We expect that the stay enjoining litigation against NARCO and Honeywell will remain in effect during the pendency of these proceedings. Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for settlement of pending and future NARCO-related asbestos claims as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 of $1.1 billion. The estimated liability for pending claims is based on terms and conditions, including evidentiary requirements, in definitive agreements with approximately 260,000 current claimants, and an estimate HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. Substantially all settlement payments with respect to current claims have been made. Approximately $100 million of payments due pursuant to these settlements is due only upon establishment of the NARCO trust. The estimated liability for future claims represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury claims expected to be asserted against NARCO through 2018 and the aforementioned obligations to NARCOs parent. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond 2018. The estimate is based upon the disease criteria and payment values contained in the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures negotiated with the NARCO Asbestos Claimants Committee and the NARCO future claimants representative. Honeywell projected the probable number and value, including trust claim handling costs, of asbestos related future liabilities based upon experience of asbestos claims filing rates in the tort system and in certain operating asbestos trusts, and the claims experience in those forums. The valuation methodology also includes an analysis of the population likely to have been exposed to asbestos containing products, epidemiological studies to estimate the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases, NARCO claims filing history, the pending inventory of NARCO asbestos related claims and payment rates expected to be established by the NARCO trust. This methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims has been commonly accepted by numerous courts and resulted in a range of estimated liability for future claims of $743 to $961 million. We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, our consolidated financial statements reflect an insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of pending and future NARCO-related asbestos claims of $831 and $877 million, respectively. This coverage reimburses Honeywell for portions of the costs incurred to settle NARCO related claims and court judgments as well as defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. At December 31, 2009, a significant portion of this coverage is with insurance companies with whom we have agreements to pay full policy limits based on corresponding Honeywell claims costs. We conduct analyses to determine the amount of insurance that we estimate is probable of recovery in relation to payment of current and estimated future claims. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. We made judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings with our insurers, our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers and various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs. In the second quarter of 2006, Travelers Casualty and Insurance Company (Travelers) filed a lawsuit against Honeywell and other insurance carriers in the Supreme Court of New York, County of New York, disputing obligations for NARCO-related asbestos claims under high excess insurance coverage issued by Travelers and other insurance carriers. Approximately $300 million of coverage under these policies is included in our NARCO-related insurance receivable at December 31, 2009. Honeywell believes it is entitled to the coverage at issue and expects to prevail in this matter. In the third quarter of 2007, Honeywell prevailed on a critical choice of law issue concerning the appropriate method of allocating NARCO-related asbestos liabilities to triggered policies. The plaintiffs appealed and the trial courts ruling was upheld by the intermediate appellate court in the second quarter of 2009. Plaintiffs further appeal to the New York Appellate Division, the highest court in New York, was denied in October 2009. A related New Jersey action brought by Honeywell has been dismissed, but all coverage claims against plaintiffs have been preserved in the New York action. Based upon (i) our understanding of relevant facts and applicable law, (ii) the terms of insurance policies at issue, (iii) our experience on matters of this nature, and (iv) the advice of counsel, we believe that the amount due from Travelers and other insurance carriers is probable of recovery. While Honeywell expects to prevail in this matter, an adverse outcome could have a material impact on our results of operations in the HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) period recognized but would not be material to our consolidated financial position or operating cash flows. Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the NARCO related asbestos liabilities or assets to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. There is no assurance that the plan of reorganization will become final, that insurance recoveries will be timely or whether there will be any NARCO related asbestos claims beyond 2018. Given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future events, we review our estimates periodically, and update them based on our experience and other relevant factors. Similarly we will reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability or other developments that may impact insurance recoveries. Friction Products Honeywells Bendix friction materials (Bendix) business manufactured automotive brake parts that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form. Existing and potential claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of individuals who performed brake replacements. From 1981 through December 31, 2009, we have resolved approximately 152,000 Bendix related asbestos claims. We had 129 trials resulting in favorable verdicts and 17 trials resulting in adverse verdicts. Four of these adverse verdicts were reversed on appeal, five verdicts were vacated on post-trial motions, three claims were settled and the remaining five have been or will be appealed. The claims portfolio was reduced in 2009 due to settlements, dismissals and the elimination of significantly aged (i.e., pending for more than six years), inactive (including claims for which the required medical and exposure showings have not been made) and duplicate claims. The following tables present information regarding Bendix related asbestos claims activity: ##TABLE_START      Claims Activity    Years Ended December 31,  2009  2008 Claims Unresolved at the beginning of year    51,951     51,658  Claims Filed    2,697     4,003  Claims Resolved    (34,708 )     (3,710 )       Claims Unresolved at the end of year    19,940     51,951       Disease Distribution of Unresolved Claims   December 31,  2009  2008 Mesothelioma and Other Cancer Claims    4,727     5,575  Other Claims    15,213     46,376       Total Claims    19,940     51,951       ##TABLE_END Honeywell has experienced average resolution values per claim excluding legal costs as follows: ##TABLE_START            Years Ended December 31,  2009  2008  2007  2006   (in whole dollars) Malignant claims   $  50,000    $  65,000    $  33,000    $  33,000  Nonmalignant claims   $     $  1,500    $     $   ##TABLE_END It is not possible to predict whether resolution values for Bendix related asbestos claims will increase, decrease or stabilize in the future. Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of pending and future Bendix related asbestos claims of $566 and $578 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our liability for the estimated cost of future Bendix related asbestos claims is based on historic claims filing experience, disease classifications, expected resolution values, and historic dismissal rates. In the fourth quarter of each year we update our analysis of the estimated cost of HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) future Bendix related asbestos claims. We have valued Bendix pending and future claims using average resolution values for the previous four years (extended from three years). Changes in the tort system which began in 2006 refocused asbestos litigation on mesothelioma cases, making the four year period 2006 through 2009 representative for forecasting purposes. We will continue to update the expected resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future Bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year. The estimated liability for future claims represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury claims expected to be asserted against Bendix over the next five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. The estimate is based upon Bendix historical experience in the tort system for the four years ended December 31, 2009 with respect to claims filing and resolution values. The methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims has been commonly accepted by numerous courts. It is similar to that used to estimate the future NARCO related asbestos claims liability. Honeywell currently has approximately $1.9 billion of insurance coverage remaining with respect to pending and potential future Bendix related asbestos claims, of which $172 and $156 million are reflected as receivables in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. This coverage is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the liability for the estimated value of the underlying asbestos claims. The amount of the insurance receivable recorded is based on our ongoing analysis of the insurance that we estimate is probable of recovery. This determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the solvency of our insurers, our interpretation of judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with our insurers. Insurance receivables are also recorded when structured insurance settlements provide for future fixed payment streams that are not contingent upon future claims or other events. Such amounts are recorded at the net present value of the fixed payment stream. On a cumulative historical basis, Honeywell has recorded insurance receivables equal to approximately 45 percent of the value of the underlying asbestos claims recorded. However, because there are gaps in our coverage due to insurance company insolvencies, certain uninsured periods, and insurance settlements, this rate is expected to decline for any future Bendix related asbestos liabilities that may be recorded. Future recoverability rates may also be impacted by numerous other factors, such as future insurance settlements, insolvencies and judicial determinations relevant to our coverage program, which are difficult to predict. Assuming continued defense and indemnity spending at current levels, we estimate that the cumulative recoverability rate could decline over the next five years to approximately 35 percent. Honeywell believes it has sufficient insurance coverage and reserves to cover all pending Bendix related asbestos claims and Bendix related asbestos claims estimated to be filed within the next five years. Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of either pending or future Bendix related asbestos claims, we do not believe that such claims would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position in light of our insurance coverage and our prior experience in resolving such claims. If the rate and types of claims filed, the average resolution value of such claims and the period of time over which claim settlements are paid (collectively, the Variable Claims Factors) do not substantially change, Honeywell would not expect future Bendix related asbestos claims to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in any fiscal year. No assurances can be given, however, that the Variable Claims Factors will not change. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Included in these other matters are the following: Allen, et al. v. Honeywell Retirement Earnings Plan Pursuant to a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona in February 2008, 18 of 21 claims alleged by plaintiffs in this class action lawsuit were dismissed with prejudice in exchange for approximately $35 million and the maximum aggregate liability for the remaining three claims (alleging that Honeywell impermissibly reduced the pension benefits of certain employees of a predecessor entity when the plan was amended in 1983 and failed to calculate benefits in accordance with the terms of the plan) was capped at $500 million. Any amounts payable, including the settlement amount, have or will be paid from the Companys pension plan. In October 2009, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Honeywell Retirement Earnings Plan with respect to the claim regarding the calculation of benefits. We continue to expect to prevail on the remaining claims in light of applicable law and our substantial affirmative defenses, which have not yet been considered fully by the Court. Accordingly, we do not believe that a liability is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable with respect to these claims and we have not recorded a provision for the remaining claims in our financial statements. Quick Lube On March 31, 2008, SE Quick Lube, a filter distributor, filed suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut alleging that twelve filter manufacturers, including Honeywell, engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices, rig bids and allocate U.S. customers for aftermarket automotive filters. This suit is a purported class action on behalf of direct purchasers of filters from the defendants. Parallel purported class actions, including on behalf of indirect purchasers of filters, have been filed by other plaintiffs in a variety of jurisdictions in the United States and Canada. The U.S cases have been consolidated into a single multi-district litigation in the Northern District of Illinois. We intend to vigorously defend the claims raised in these actions. The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice notified Honeywell on January 21, 2010 that it has officially closed its investigation into possible collusion in the replacement auto filters industry. Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations (including the specific matters referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters. Considering our past experience and existing accruals, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. Warranties and Guarantees We have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at December 31, 2009: ##TABLE_START      Maximum Potential Future Payments Operating lease residual values   $   Other third parties financing    4  Unconsolidated affiliates financing    30  Customer financing    16       $      ##TABLE_END We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination, if any, existing on the date of disposition. Such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In the normal course of business we issue product warranties and product performance guarantees. We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale. Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties and guarantees are made as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable. The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded obligations for product warranties and product performance guarantees: ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2009  2008  2007 Beginning of year   $     $     $   Accruals for warranties/guarantees issued during the year    188     242     233  Adjustment of pre-existing warranties/guarantees    (7 )     (34 )     3  Settlement of warranty/guarantee claims    (191 )     (187 )     (203 )         End of year   $     $     $          ##TABLE_END Product warranties and product performance guarantees are included in the following balance sheet accounts: ##TABLE_START        2009  2008 Accrued liabilities   $     $   Other liabilities    25     32         $     $        ##TABLE_END Note 22Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. Pension benefits for substantially all U.S. employees are HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. U.S. defined benefit pension plans comprise 76 percent of our projected benefit obligation. Non-U.S. employees, who are not U.S. citizens, are covered by various retirement benefit arrangements, some of which are considered to be defined benefit pension plans for accounting purposes. Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans comprise 24 percent of our projected benefit obligation. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage to eligible retirees. Our retiree medical plans mainly cover U.S. employees who retire with pension eligibility for hospital, professional and other medical services. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell after January 1, 2000 are not eligible to participate in our retiree medical and life insurance plans. Most of the U.S. retiree medical plans require deductibles and copayments, and virtually all are integrated with Medicare. Retiree contributions are generally required based on coverage type, plan and Medicare eligibility. Honeywell has limited its subsidy of its retiree medical plans to a fixed-dollar amount for all future retirees and for more than half of its current retirees. This cap of retiree medical benefits under our plans limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. On May 1, 2009, Honeywell amended the U.S. retiree medical plan eliminating the subsidy for non-union employees who retire after September 1, 2009. Employees already retired or who retired on or before September 1, 2009 were not affected by this change. This plan amendment reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $180 million representing the elimination of benefits attributable to years of service already rendered by active non-union employees who are not eligible to retire and those eligible non-union employees who are assumed not to retire prior to September 1, 2009. This reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation will be recognized as part of net periodic postretirement benefit cost over the average future service period to full eligibility of the remaining active union employees still eligible for a retiree medical subsidy. This plan amendment also resulted in a curtailment gain of $98 million in the second quarter of 2009 which was included as part of net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The curtailment gain represents the recognition of previously unrecognized prior service credits attributable to the future years of service of the employee group for which future accrual of benefits has been eliminated.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Major actuarial assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost for our U.S. benefit plans are presented in the following table. For non-U.S. benefit plans, none of which was individually material, assumptions reflect economic assumptions applicable to each country. ##TABLE_START                Pension Benefits  Other Postretirement Benefits  2009  2008  2007  2009  2008  2007 Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31:             Discount rate    5.75 %     6.95 %     6.50 %     5.25 %     6.00 %     5.90 %  Expected annual rate of compensation increase    4.50 %     4.50 %     4.50 %                 Actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended December 31:             Discount rate    6.95 %     6.50 %     6.00 %     6.00 %     5.90 %     5.70 %  Expected rate of return on plan assets    9.00 %     9.00 %     9.00 %                 Expected annual rate of compensation increase    4.50 %     4.50 %     4.00 %                 ##TABLE_END To select a discount rate for our retirement benefit plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of double A rated fixed-income debt instruments. We use the average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations. Our expected rate of return on plan assets of 9 percent is a long-term rate based on historic plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations. The expected rate of return is a long-term assumption and generally does not change annually. Pension Benefits Included in the aggregate data in the tables above are the amounts applicable to our pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets. Amounts related to such plans were as follows: ##TABLE_START        December 31,  2009  2008 Projected benefit obligations   $  17,159    $  14,713  Accumulated benefit obligations   $  16,102    $  14,012  Fair value of plan assets   $  12,999    $  11,125  ##TABLE_END The accumulated benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was $16.8 and $14.3 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our asset investment strategy focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve our long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. Our actual invested positions in various securities change over time based on short and longer-term investment opportunities. To achieve our objectives, we have established long-term target allocations as follows: 60-70 percent equity securities, 10-20 percent fixed income securities and cash, 5-15 percent real estate investments, and 10-20 percent other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located both inside and outside the United States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) investments in real estate funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies. Our non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country, but the long-term investment objectives remain the same. Our U.S. pension plans assets were $10.3 and $8.7 billion and our non-U.S. pension plans assets were $3.5 and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

In 2009, 2008 and 2007, we made voluntary contributions of $740, $242 and $42 million, respectively, to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans primarily to improve the funded status of our plans. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair value of our pension plans assets invested in Honeywell common stock was $1.1 billion and $204 million, respectively. During 2010, we plan to make additional voluntary contributions of Honeywell common stock to our U.S. plans to improve the funded status of our plans. In 2010, we also expect to contribute approximately $150 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards and to fund benefits to be paid directly from Company assets. Benefit payments, including amounts to be paid from Company assets, and reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows: ##TABLE_START      $  1,106  2011    1,143  2012    1,161  2013    1,173  2014    1,189  2015-2019    6,219  ##TABLE_END 97 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Other Postretirement Benefits The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) provides subsidies for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug coverage that is at least actuarially equivalent to that offered by Medicare Part D.

Segment information is consistent with how management reviews the businesses, makes investing and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance. Our four reportable segments are as follows: ##TABLE_START     Aerospace is organized by customer end-market (Air Transport and Regional, Business and General Aviation and Defense and Space) and provides products and services which include auxiliary power units; propulsion engines; environmental control systems; engine controls; repair and overhaul services; hardware; logistics; electric power systems; flight safety, communications, navigation, radar and surveillance systems; aircraft lighting; management and technical services; advanced systems and instruments; and aircraft wheels and brakes.     Automation and Control Solutions includes Products (controls for heating, cooling, indoor air quality, ventilation, humidification and home automation; advanced software applications for home/building control and optimization; sensors, switches, control systems and instruments for measuring pressure, air flow, temperature and electrical current; security, fire and gas detection; personal protection equipment; access control; video surveillance; and remote patient monitoring systems); Building Solutions (installs, maintains and upgrades systems that keep buildings safe, comfortable and productive); and Process Solutions (provides a full range of automation and control solutions for industrial plants, offering advanced software and automation systems that integrate, control and monitor complex processes in many types of industrial settings).     Specialty Materials includes fluorocarbons, specialty films, advanced fibers, customized research chemicals and intermediates, electronic materials and chemicals, and catalysts and adsorbents.     Transportation Systems includes Honeywell Turbo Technologies (turbochargers and charge-air and thermal systems); and the Consumer Products Group (car care products including antifreeze, filters, spark plugs, and cleaners, waxes and additives); and Friction Materials (brake hard parts and other friction materials). ##TABLE_END The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1. Honeywells senior management evaluates segment performance based on segment profit. Segment profit is measured as business unit income (loss) before taxes excluding general corporate unallocated expense, other income (expense), interest and other financial charges, pension and other postretirement benefits (expense), stock compensation expense, repositioning and other charges and accounting changes. Beginning January 1, 2008, consistent with changes made to the measure of segment performance utilized by senior management, segment profit has been adjusted to exclude expense associated with restricted stock units (RSU) and to include equity income/(loss) of affiliated companies. Stock compensation expense, including RSU expense, totaled $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2.) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As discussed in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, in 2009 the Company retrospectively applied the accounting for noncontrolling interests and in 2007 changed the manner in which it accounts for income tax uncertainties. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey February 11, 2010 ", "9A": " Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Honeywell management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K to ensure information required to be disclosed in the reports that Honeywell files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and our Controller, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There have been no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Honeywells internal control over financial reporting that have occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Honeywell management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Honeywells internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Honeywells internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Honeywells assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Honeywells management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Honeywells assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of Honeywells internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management determined that Honeywell maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. The effectiveness of Honeywells internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8.

(the Non-Employee Director Plan) (175,000 shares of Common Stock to be issued for options; 3,000 restricted units subject to continued services;) and the 1994 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (122,000 shares of Common Stock to be issued for options). ##TABLE_END 957,669 growth plan units were issued for the performance cycle commencing on January 1, 2007 and ending December 31, 2008 pursuant to the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. The ultimate value of any growth plan award may be paid in cash or shares of Common Stock and, thus, growth plan units are not included in the table above. The ultimate value of growth plan units depends upon the achievement of pre-established performance goals during a two-year performance cycle relating to growth in earnings per share, revenue and return on investment. 50% of the payment related to these growth plan units was paid in 2009 and the remaining 50% will be paid in 2010, subject to active employment on the payment dates. Because the number of future shares that may be distributed to employees participating in the Honeywell Global Stock Plan is unknown, no shares attributable to that plan are included in column (a) of the table above. ##TABLE_START (2)    Column (b) does not include any exercise price for restricted units or growth plan units granted to employees or non-employee directors under equity compensation plans approved by shareowners. Restricted units do not have an exercise price because their value is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals or continued employment or service and they are settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. Growth plan units are denominated in cash units and the ultimate value of the award is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals. (3)    The number of shares that may be issued under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2009 is 30,000,541 which includes the following additional shares under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (or any Prior Plan as defined in the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan) that may again be available for ##TABLE_END 106 ##TABLE_START     issuance: shares that are settled for cash, expire, are canceled, are tendered in satisfaction of an option exercise price or tax withholding obligations, are reacquired with cash tendered in satisfaction of an option exercise price or with monies attributable to any tax deduction enjoyed by Honeywell to the exercise of an option, and are under any outstanding awards assumed under any equity compensation plan of an entity acquired by Honeywell.     The number of shares that may be issued under the Honeywell Global Stock Plan as of December 31, 2009 is 2,754,730. This plan is an umbrella plan for five plans maintained solely for eligible employees of participating non-U.S. countries. One sub-plan, the Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan, allows eligible employees to contribute between 2.2% and 8.8% of base pay from January through September of each year to purchase shares of Common Stock the following November at the fair market value on the date of purchase. Participant accounts are credited with matching shares equal to 20% of their contributions that are subject to continued employment for 3 years; provided that no matching shares will be credited to individuals participating in this plan during 2010. For 2009, Honeywell used Treasury shares to provide the shares under this plan. Employees purchased and were credited with 167,751 shares of Common Stock in 2009.     Another sub-plan, the UK Sharebuilder Plan, allows an eligible UK employee to contribute a specified percentage of taxable earnings that is then invested in shares. The company matches those shares and dividends paid are used to purchase additional shares; provided that the Company temporarily reduced the match share to 50 percent in 2009. Matched shares are subject to a three-year vesting schedule. Shares taken out of the plan before five years lose their tax-favored status. For the year ending December 31, 2009, 145,079 shares were credited to participants accounts under the UK Sharebuilder Plan.     The remaining three sub-plans, Honeywell International Technologies Employees Share Ownership Plan (Ireland), the Honeywell Measurex (Ireland) Limited Group Employee Profit Sharing Scheme and the Honeywell Ireland Software Employees Share Ownership Plan, allow eligible Irish employees to contribute specified percentages of base pay, bonus or performance pay that are then invested in shares. Shares must be held in trust for at least two years and lose their tax-favored status if they are taken out of the plan before three years. For the year ending December 31, 2009, 26,261 shares were credited to participants accounts under these three plans.     The remaining 297,000 shares included in column (c) are shares remaining for future grants under the Non-Employee Director Plan. (4)    Equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners that are included in the table are the Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees of Honeywell International Inc. and its Subsidiaries, the AlliedSignal Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Employees of AlliedSignal Inc. and its Subsidiaries, and the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc.     The Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees of Honeywell International Inc. and its Subsidiaries is an unfunded, non-tax qualified plan that provides benefits equal to the employee deferrals and company matching allocations that would have been provided under Honeywells U.S. tax-qualified savings plan if the Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and contributions did not apply. The company matching contribution is credited to participants accounts in the form of notional shares of Common Stock. Additional notional shares are credited to participants accounts equal to the value of any cash dividends payable on actual shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of Common Stock when payments are made to participants under the plan.     The AlliedSignal Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Employees of AlliedSignal Inc. and its Subsidiaries was a cash incentive compensation plan maintained by AlliedSignal Inc. This plan has expired. Employees were permitted to defer receipt of a cash bonus payable under the plan and invest the deferred bonus in notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of Common Stock when payments are made to participants under the plan. No further deferrals can be made under this plan. The number of shares of Common Stock that remain to be issued under this expired plan as of December 31, 2009 is 46,046. ##TABLE_END 107 ##TABLE_START     The Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. provides for mandatory and elective deferral of certain payments to non-employee directors. Mandatory deferrals are invested in notional shares of Common Stock. Directors may also invest any elective deferrals in notional shares of Common Stock. Additional notional shares are credited to participant accounts equal to the value of any cash dividends payable on actual shares of Common Stock. Notional shares of Common Stock are converted to an equivalent amount of cash at the time the distributions are made from the plan to directors. (5)    Column (b) does not include any exercise price for notional shares allocated to employees under Honeywells equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners because all of these shares are notionally allocated as a matching contribution under the non-tax qualified savings plans or as a notional investment of deferred bonuses or fees under the cash incentive compensation and directors plans as described in note 4 and are only settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. (6)    No securities are available for future issuance under the AlliedSignal Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Employees of AlliedSignal Inc. and its Subsidiaries and the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. The cash incentive compensation plan has expired. All notional investments in shares of Common Stock are converted to cash when payments are made under the directors plan.

Our sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers were 6, 7 and 9 percent of our total sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 10, 11 and 11 percent of our total sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our Aerospace results of operations can be impacted by various industry and economic conditions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. U.S. Government Sales Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by our Aerospace segment), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $4,354, $4,288 and $4,240 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a prime contractor and subcontractor, of $3,500, $3,455 and $3,412 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. U.S. defense spending increased in 2010. Although we expect a slight decline in our defense and space revenue in 2011 (see Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), we do not expect to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2011 federal spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEM production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs). Our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to audits, investigations, and termination by the government. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. Backlog Our total backlog at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $14,616 and $13,182 million, respectively. We anticipate that approximately $10,609 million of the 2010 backlog will be filled in 2011. We believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option. Competition We are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas. Competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions. Competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us, and vary by country. Depending on the particular customer or market involved, our businesses compete on a variety of factors, such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are generally important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors for certain products include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. However, a number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies, some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers. See Item 1A Risk Factors for further discussion. International Operations We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development mainly in the United States, Europe, Asia, Canada, Middle East and Latin America. U.S. exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 11, 12 and 10 percent of our total sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Foreign manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe, were 41, 39 and 39 percent of our total sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Approximately 17 percent of total 2010 sales of Aerospace-related products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products and systems and performance of services such as aircraft repair and overhaul. Exports were principally made to Europe, Canada, Asia and Latin America. Foreign manufactured products and systems and performance of services comprised approximately 15 percent of total 2010 Aerospace sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Canada and Asia. Approximately 2 percent of total 2010 sales of Automation and Control Solutions products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Foreign manufactured products and performance of services accounted for 58 percent of total 2010 Automation and Control Solutions sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Asia and Canada. Approximately 30 percent of total 2010 sales of Specialty Materials products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Exports were principally made to Asia and Latin America. Foreign manufactured products and performance of services comprised 27 percent of total 2010 Specialty Materials sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Asia and Canada. Approximately 3 percent of total 2010 sales of Transportation Systems products were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Foreign manufactured products accounted for 70 percent of total 2010 sales of Transportation Systems. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Asia and Latin America. Financial information including net sales and long-lived assets related to geographic areas is included in Note 24 of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Information regarding the economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international operations is included in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Raw Materials The principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available. We experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials and commodities in 2010. We are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials, except related to phenol, a raw material used in our Specialty Materials segment. We purchase phenol under a supply agreement with one supplier. The costs of certain key raw materials, including natural gas, benzene (the key component in phenol), ethylene, fluorspar and sulfur in our Specialty Materials business, steel, nickel, other metals and ethylene glycol in our Transportation Systems business, and nickel, titanium and other metals in our Aerospace business, are expected to remain volatile. In addition, in 2010 certain large long-term fixed supplier price agreements expired, primarily relating to components used by our Aerospace business, which in the aggregate, subjected us to higher volatility in certain component costs. We will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2011. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion. We are highly dependent on our suppliers and subcontractors in order to meet commitments to our customers. In addition, many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a single-source basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies. We maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties. While we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Furthermore, the inability of these suppliers to meet their quality and/or delivery commitments to us, due to bankruptcy, natural disasters or any other reason, may result in significant costs and delay, including those in connection with the required recertification of parts from new suppliers with our customers or regulatory agencies. Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. We own, or are licensed under, a large number of patents, patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years, which relate to many of our products or improvements to those products and which are of importance to our business. From time to time, new patents and trademarks are obtained, and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others. We also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and services produced by other companies. In our judgment, those rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any patent, trademark or related group of patents, or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product, to be of material importance in relation to our total business. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion. We have registered trademarks for a number of our products and services, including Honeywell, Aclar, Ademco, Autolite, Bendix, Enovate, Fire-Lite, FRAM, Garrett, Hand Held, Holts, Jurid, Metrologic, MK, North, Notifier, Novar, Prestone, Redex, RMG, Simoniz, Spectra, System Sensor and UOP. Research and Development Our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of new products, technologies and processes and the development of new uses for existing products. The Companys principal research and development activities are in the U.S., Europe, India and China. Research and development (RD) expense totaled $1,466, $1,330 and $1,543 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in RD expense of 10 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 was mainly due to additional product design and development costs in Automation and Control Solutions and increased expenditures on the development of products for new aircraft platforms. The decrease in RD expense in 2009 compared to 2008 of 14 percent was consistent with our 15 percent decrease in net sales. RD as a percentage of sales was 4.4, 4.3 and 4.2 percent in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Customer-sponsored (principally the U.S. Government) RD activities amounted to an additional $874, $852 and $903 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Environment We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. It is our policy to comply with these requirements, and we believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys Superfund priority list. Although, under some court interpretations of these laws, there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole. We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Companys business or markets that it serves, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. Further information, including the current status of significant environmental matters and the financial impact incurred for remediation of such environmental matters, if any, is included in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Employees We have approximately 130,000 employees at December 31, 2010, of which approximately 53,000 were located in the United States. ##TABLE_START ", "1A": " I tem 1A. Risk Factors ##TABLE_END Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements We have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including the overview of the Company and each of our segments and the discussion of their respective economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2011. These sections and other parts of this report (including this Item 1A) contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. Risk Factors Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the market and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations. The operating results of our segments are impacted by general global industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns, demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing and shipping costs. The operating results of our Aerospace segment, which generated 32 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2010, are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production, the deferral or cancellation of orders for new aircraft, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft platforms, the retirement of aircraft, global flying hours, and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates, as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts, supplier consolidation, factory transitions, capacity constraints, and the level and mix of U.S. Government appropriations for defense and space programs (as further discussed in other risk factors below). The challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including global flying hours, aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline consolidation, airline insolvencies, terrorism and safety concerns as well as changes in regulations. Future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our Aerospace aftermarket sales and margins. The operating results of our Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) segment, which generated 41 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2010, are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation, industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion, inventory levels in distribution channels, and global economic growth rates. Specialty Materials operating results, which generated 14 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2010, are impacted by global economic growth rates, capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, and commodity demand volatility. Transportation Systems operating results, which generated 13 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2010, are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, and regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, delays in launch schedules for new automotive platforms, and consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket and car care products. Demand of global automotive and truck manufacturers will continue to be influenced by a wide variety of factors, including ability of consumers to obtain financing, ability to reduce operating costs and overall consumer and business confidence. Each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices (as further described below) and non-material inflation. Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers, and cause us to incur significant liabilities. The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in our Specialty Materials (benzene (the key component in phenol), natural gas, ethylene, fluorspar and sulfur), Transportation Systems (nickel, steel, other metals and ethylene glycol) and Aerospace (nickel, titanium and other metals) segments. Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations. Our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials (including raw materials) by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions, quality standards, and applicable laws and regulations. In addition, many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a single-source basis; in some circumstances these suppliers are the sole source of the component or equipment. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers ability to adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their non-performance. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by suppliers decisions to exit certain businesses and by external events such as natural disasters, extreme weather events, pandemic health issues, terrorist actions, labor disputes, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes (e.g., product certification or stewardship requirements, sourcing restrictions, climate change or greenhouse gas emission standards, etc.). Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. Transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays, including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/or regulatory agencies. In addition, because our businesses cannot always immediately adapt their cost structure to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity for certain products may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements, which could adversely impact our operating costs, profitability and customer and supplier relationships. Our facilities, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to, among other things fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, result in personal injury or property damage, damage relationships with our customers and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities or systems, as well as result in other liabilities and adverse impacts. The same risk can also arise from the failure of critical systems supplied by Honeywell to large industrial, refining and petrochemical customers. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins. Our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) develop and retain individuals with the requisite expertise. Our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources. These development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts. We own or are licensed under a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications, trademarks and copyrights. Our intellectual property rights may expire or be challenged, invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms. In some non-U.S. countries, laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application, which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights. Any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs, and/or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. Our systems are subject to risks from unlawful attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems through the Internet. The theft and/or unauthorized use or production of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could reduce the value of our investment in RD and product development and could subject us to claims by third parties relating to loss of their confidential or proprietary information. An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations. Our international operations, including U.S. exports, comprise a growing proportion of our operating results. Our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets, including developing markets such as Mexico, Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. In 2010, 52 percent of our total sales (including products manufactured in the U.S. and in international locations) were outside of the U.S. including 28 percent in Europe and 11 percent in Asia. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, government instability, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. We are also subject to U.S. laws prohibiting companies from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the type of business that may be conducted in these countries. The cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. As we continue to grow our businesses internationally, our operating results could be increasingly affected by the relative strength of the European and Asian economies and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. We do have a policy to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities, but such activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us and may not be successful in eliminating such volatility. We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our long-lived assets or available for sale investments. At December 31, 2010, the net carrying value of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) and available for sale securities totaled approximately $19.0 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other long-lived assets. An other than temporary decline in the market value of our available for sale securities may also result in an impairment charge. Future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareowners equity and increase our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, which could negatively impact our credit rating and access to the public debt and equity markets. A change in the level of U.S. Government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact Aerospaces defense and space sales and results of operations. Sales of our defense and space-related products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets, particularly the U.S. defense budget. Sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. Department of Defense comprised approximately 33 and 10 percent of Aerospace and total sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2010. We cannot predict the extent to which total funding and/or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the 2011 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by Congress, or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations. We also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning and/or the nature of war-related activity on existing, follow-on or replacement programs. A shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate and/or reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations. As a supplier of military and other equipment to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unusual risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance. In addition to normal business risks, companies like Honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the U.S. Government are subject to unusual risks, including dependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds, changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments, significant changes in contract scheduling, complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete, necessity for constant design improvements, intense competition for U.S. Government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development, difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work, and other factors characteristic of the industry, such as contract award protests and delays in the timing of contract approvals. Changes are customary over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly development contracts, and generally result in adjustments of contract prices. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to audits. Like many other government contractors, we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts or changes to certain accounting systems or controls to comply with various government regulations. We have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in appropriate cases and may do so in the future. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, plus termination costs and a reasonable profit. If a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for additional costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from any other source and any other damages suffered by the government. We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If Honeywell or one of its businesses were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental or export laws), it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. The U.S. Government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other egregious misconduct. Debarment generally does not exceed three years. Our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees, agents or business partners. We cannot ensure that our extensive compliance controls, policies and procedures will in all instances protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including laws governing payments to government officials, competition and data privacy. Any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, results of operations and reputation. Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations. Safety and performance regulations (including mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft), product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact Aerospace sales, research and development expenditures, operating costs and profitability. The demand for and cost of providing Automation and Control Solutions products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Specialty Materials results of operations can be affected by environmental (e.g. government regulation of fluorocarbons), safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations, while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our Transportation Systems segment. Legislation or regulations regarding areas such as labor and employment, employee benefit plans, tax, health, safety and environmental matters, import, export and trade, intellectual property, product certification, and product liability may impact the results of each of our operating segments and our consolidated results. Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned, and divestitures may not occur as planned. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, (ii) the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities, (iii) the failure to integrate acquired businesses into Honeywell on schedule and/or to achieve synergies in the planned amount or within the expected timeframe, (iv) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected timeframe, and (v) the degree of protection provided by indemnities from sellers of acquired companies and the obligations under indemnities provided to purchasers of our divested businesses. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, import and export matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings. Moreover, our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. It also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition. Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We have incurred remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We incur, and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our expenses include significant costs related to employee and retiree health benefits. With approximately 130,000 employees, including approximately 53,000 in the U.S., our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health benefits are significant. In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs, largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control, in particular, ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation. Continued increasing health-care costs, legislative or regulatory changes, and volatility in discount rates, as well as changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health benefit expenses, may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and pension contributions in future periods. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. Funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans may become more significant. However, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. For a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to estimate pension expense, including discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies included in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. In 2010, our tax expense represented 28.4 percent of our income before tax, and includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company that could effect the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. Volatility of credit markets or macro-economic factors could adversely affect our business. Changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate volatility, may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. A decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing. Delays in our customers ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing to our customers, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. The inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could result in the need to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant incremental cost and delay, as discussed above. Lastly, disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets could impact the financial institutions with which we do business. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " I tem 1B.

Legal Proceedings ##TABLE_END We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial amounts) arising out of the conduct of our business. See a discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation matters in Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. Environmental Matters Involving Potential Monetary Sanctions in Excess of $100,000 Although the outcome of the matters discussed below cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any of them, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows. The United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Department of Justice (federal authorities) are investigating whether the storage of certain sludges generated during uranium hexafluoride production at our Metropolis, Illinois facility has been in compliance with the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The federal authorities have convened a grand jury in this matter. The Company has cooperated fully in the investigation and has been engaged in discussions with the federal authorities regarding a resolution of this matter, which the Company expects to finalize in the first quarter of 2011. The storage issue at the Metropolis site was also previously voluntarily disclosed to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, with whom Honeywell has been working to resolve related civil environmental claims. In November 2010 Honeywell reached a final settlement agreement with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to settle allegations that Honeywell failed to properly close out waste storage areas associated with legacy operations in Syracuse, New York, which areas are known as the Solvay Settling Basins. Under the terms of the settlement, Honeywell will pay a fine of $100,000 and implement certain environmental projects in the area. The United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Department of Justice are investigating whether the Companys manufacturing facility in Hopewell, Virginia is in compliance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act and the facilitys air operating permit. Based on these investigations, the federal authorities have issued notices of violation with respect to the facilitys benzene waste operations, leak detection and repair program, emissions of nitrogen oxides and emissions of particulate matter. The Company has entered into negotiations with federal authorities to resolve the alleged violations.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities ##TABLE_END Market and dividend information for Honeywells common stock is included in Note 26 of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The number of record holders of our common stock at December 31, 2010 was 61,830. Honeywell did not purchase any of its common stock, par value $1 per share, for the year ending December 31, 2010. The Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $3 billion of Honeywell common stock, which amount includes $1.3 billion that remained available under the Companys previously reported share repurchase program. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time during 2011 to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including future option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating, financing and other investing activities. Performance Graph The following graph compares the five-year cumulative total return on our Common Stock to the total returns on the Standard  Poors 500 Stock Index and a composite of Standard  Poors Industrial Conglomerates and Aerospace and Defense indices, on a 60%/40% weighted basis, respectively (the Composite Index). The weighting of the components of the Composite Index are based on our segments relative contribution to total segment profit. In prior years, these components had been equally weighted. The change in weighting reflects the growth, both organic and through acquisitions, in the Companys non-Aerospace businesses. The selection of the Industrial Conglomerates component of the Composite Index reflects the diverse and distinct range of non-aerospace businesses conducted by Honeywell. Per SEC rules, we are including the Composite Index on an equally weighted basis in the graph below with respect to 2005-2009. The annual changes for the five-year period shown in the graph are based on the assumption that $100 had been invested in Honeywell stock and each index on December 31, 2005 and that all dividends were reinvested. ##TABLE_START   Dec 2005  Dec 2006  Dec 2007  Dec 2008  Dec 2009  Dec 2010        Honeywell    124.17   172.15   94.08   116.49   162.52   SP 500    115.79   122.16   76.96   97.33   111.99   Composite Index (60/40)    115.23   127.14   69.27   80.32   94.19   Composite Index (50/50)    116.89   130.72   73.18   85.91      ##TABLE_END 21 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_END (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Honeywell International Inc. (Honeywell) for the three years ended December 31, 2010. All references to Notes related to Notes to the Financial Statements in Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_START Net Sales                              Net sales  $ 33,370  $ 30,908  $ 36,556  % change compared with prior period   %  (15 )%    ##TABLE_END The change in net sales compared to the prior year period is attributable to the following: ##TABLE_START   2010 Versus 2009  2009 Versus 2008    Volume   %  (14 )% Price   %  % Acquisitions/Divestitures   %  % Foreign Exchange   %  (2 )%        %  (15 )%     ##TABLE_END A discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this MDA. ##TABLE_START Cost of Products and Services Sold                              Cost of products and services sold  $ 25,519  $ 24,012  $ 31,118  % change compared with prior period   %  (23 )%               Gross Margin percentage   23.5 %  22.3 %  14.9 % ##TABLE_END Cost of products and services sold increased by $1,507 million or 6 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 principally due to an estimated increase in direct material costs and indirect costs of approximately $1,300 million and $300 million, respectively, driven substantially by an 8 percent increase in sales as a result of the factors discussed above and in the Review of Business Segments section of this MDA and an $150 million increase in Repositioning and Other Charges (see Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements), partially offset by a $300 million decrease in pension expense. Gross margin percentage increased by 1.2 percentage points in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to lower pension expense (approximate 1 percentage point impact) and higher sales volume driven by our Automation and Control Solutions segment, Specialty Materials segment and Transportation Systems segment (approximate 0.7 percentage point impact), partially offset by higher repositioning and other charges (approximate 0.4 percentage point impact). Cost of products and services sold decreased by $7,106 million or 23 percent in the 2009 compared with 2008. The decrease is primarily due to lower pension expense, lower sales as a result of the factors discussed within the Review of Business Segments section of this MDA, lower material costs, reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work scheduled reductions, benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation), the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives across each of our Business Segments, and lower repositioning charges. Gross margin percentage increased by 7.4 percentage points in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to lower pension expense, increases of 2.9 and 0.6 percent, respectively, in our Specialty Materials and Automation  Controls Solutions segments, as a result of the cost savings initiatives discussed above, and lower repositioning charges, partially offset by lower margins in our Transportation Systems and Aerospace Solutions segments of 3.2 and 0.7 percent, respectively, due to lower sales partially offset by the impact of cost savings initiatives. ##TABLE_START Selling, General and Administrative Expenses                              Selling, general and administrative expense  $ 4,717  $ 4,443  $ 5,130  Percent of sales   14.1 %  14.4 %  14.0 % ##TABLE_END Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) decreased as a percentage of sales by 0.3 percent in 2010 compared to the 2009 driven by the impact of higher sales volume, discussed above, and lower pension expense, partially offset by an estimated $500 million increase in labor costs (reflecting the absence of prior period labor cost actions). SGA as a percentage of sales increased by 0.4 of a percentage point in 2009 compared with 2008. The increase as a percentage of sales was driven by lower sales volumes, substantially offset by the positive impact of i) lower pension expense, (ii) indirect cost savings initiatives across each of our Business Segments, iii) reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work schedule reductions, benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation) and iv) lower repositioning charges. ##TABLE_START Other (Income) Expense                              Equity (income)/loss of affiliated companies  $ (29 ) $ (26 ) $ (63 ) Gain on sale of non-strategic businesses and assets      (87 )  (635 ) Interest income   (40 )  (33 )  (102 ) Foreign exchange        Other, net   (39 )              $ (95 ) $ (55 ) $ (748 )       ##TABLE_END Other income increased by $40 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to i) a $62 million pre-tax gain related to the consolidation of a joint venture within our Specialty Materials segment in the third quarter of 2010 (see Note 4 of Notes to Financial statements) for further details, ii) the absence of an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $62 million in the second quarter of 2009, partially offset by the absence of a $50 million deconsolidation gain related to a subsidiary within our Automation and Control Solutions segment in 2009 and $22 million of acquisition related costs in 2010. Other income decreased by $693 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to i) a lower gain on sale of non-strategic businesses and assets due to the gain on the sale of our Consumables Solutions business in 2008 partially offset by a gain related to the deconsolidation of a subsidiary within our Automation and Control Solutions segment in 2009 (See Note 4 to the financial statements) and ii) lower interest income primarily due to lower interest rates on cash balances. ##TABLE_START Interest and Other Financial Charges                              Interest and other financial charges  $  $  $  % change compared with prior period   (16 )%  %    ##TABLE_END Interest and other financial charges decreased by 16 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to lower debt balances and lower borrowing costs. Interest and other financial charges increased by 1 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 due to lower debt balances offset by higher borrowing costs on term debt. ##TABLE_START Tax Expense                              Tax expense  $  $  $ (226 ) Effective tax rate   28.4 %  22.7 %  (37.7 )% ##TABLE_END The effective tax rate increased by 5.7 percentage points in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings related to lower U.S. pension expense, the impact of an enacted change in the tax treatment of the Medicare Part D program, the absence of manufacturing incentives, a decreased impact from the settlement of audits and an increase in the foreign effective tax rate. The foreign effective tax rate increased by approximately 7 percentage points which primarily consisted of i) a 6 percentage point impact from the absence of tax benefits related to foreign exchange and investment losses and ii) a 0.5 percentage points impact from increased valuation allowances on net operating loss. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign rates. The effective tax rate increased by 60.4 percentage points in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings related to lower U.S. pension expense and to a lesser extent, a decreased impact from the settlement of audits. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign rates. In 2011, the effective tax rate could change based upon the Companys operating results and the outcome of tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns currently under audit by various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities, several of which may be finalized in the foreseeable future. The Company believes that it has adequate reserves for these matters, the outcome of which could materially impact the results of operations and operating cash flows in the period they are resolved. ##TABLE_START Net Income Attributable to Honeywell                              Net income attributable to Honeywell  $ 2,022  $ 1,548  $  Earnings per share of common stock  assuming dilution  $ 2.59  $ 2.05  $ 1.08  ##TABLE_END Earnings per share of common stock  assuming dilution increased by $0.54 per share in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to increased segment profit in our Automation and Control Solutions, Specialty Materials and Transportation Systems segments and lower pension expense, partially offset by higher tax expense and higher repositioning and other charges. Earnings per share of common stock  assuming dilution increased by $0.97 per share in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily relates to lower pension expense and lower repositioning charges, partially offset by a decrease in segment profit in each of our business segments, decreased Other (Income) Expense, as discussed above, and an increase in the number of shares outstanding. For further discussion of segment results, see Review of Business Segments. BUSINESS OVERVIEW This Business Overview provides a summary of Honeywell and its four reportable operating segments (Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions, Specialty Materials and Transportation Systems), including their respective areas of focus for 2011 and the relevant economic and other factors impacting their results, and a discussion of each segments results for the three years ended December 31, 2010. Each of these segments is comprised of various product and service classes that serve multiple end markets. See Note 23 to the financial statements for further information on our reportable segments and our definition of segment profit. Economic and Other Factors In addition to the factors listed below with respect to each of our operating segments, our consolidated operating results are principally driven by: ##TABLE_START   Impact of global economic growth rates (U.S., Europe and emerging regions) and industry conditions on demand in our key end markets;      Overall sales mix, in particular the mix of Aerospace original equipment and aftermarket sales and the mix of Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) products and services sales;      The extent to which cost savings from productivity actions are able to offset or exceed the impact of material and non-material inflation;      The impact of the pension discount rate and asset returns on pension expense, including mark-to-market adjustments, and funding requirements; and      The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rate, particularly the U.S. dollar-Euro exchange rate. ##TABLE_END Areas of Focus for 2011 The areas of focus for 2011, which are generally applicable to each of our operating segments, include: ##TABLE_START   Driving profitable growth by building innovative products that address customer needs;      Achieving sales growth, technological excellence and manufacturing capability through global expansion, especially focused on emerging regions in China, India and the Middle East;      Proactively managing raw material costs through formula and long term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities, where feasible;      Driving cash flow conversion through effective working capital management and capital investment in our businesses, thereby enhancing liquidity, repayment of debt, strategic acquisitions, and the ability to return value to shareholders;      Actively monitoring trends in short-cycle end markets, such as the Transportation Systems Turbo business, ACS Products businesses, Aerospace commercial after-market and Specialty Materials Advanced Materials, and continuing to take proactive cost actions;      Aligning and prioritizing investments in long-term growth considering short-term demand volatility;      Driving productivity savings through execution of repositioning actions;      Controlling discretionary spending levels with focus on non-customer related costs;      Ensuring preparedness to maximize performance in response to improving end market conditions while controlling costs by proactively managing capacity utilization, supply chain and inventory demand;      Utilizing our enablers Honeywell Operating System (HOS), Functional Transformation and Velocity Product Development (VPD) to standardize the way we work, increase quality and reduce the costs of product manufacturing, reduce costs and enhance the quality of our administrative functions and improve business operations through investments in systems and process improvements;      Monitoring both suppliers and customers for signs of liquidity constraints, limiting exposure to any resulting inability to meet delivery commitments or pay amounts due, and identifying alternate sources of supply as necessary; and      Controlling Corporate costs, including costs incurred for asbestos and environmental matters, pension and other post-retirement expenses and tax expense. ##TABLE_END 26 Review of Business Segments ##TABLE_START         Net Sales           Aerospace           Product  $ 5,868  $ 5,930  $ 7,676  Service   4,815   4,833   4,974        Total   10,683   10,763   12,650  Automation and Control Solutions           Product   11,733   10,699   11,953  Service   2,016   1,912   2,065        Total   13,749   12,611   14,018  Specialty Materials           Product   4,449   3,895   4,961  Service              Total   4,726   4,144   5,266  Transportation Systems           Product   4,212   3,389   4,622  Service                 Total   4,212   3,389   4,622  Corporate           Product           Service                Total                  $ 33,370  $ 30,908  $ 36,556                   Segment Profit           Aerospace  $ 1,835  $ 1,893  $ 2,300  Automation and Control Solutions   1,770   1,588   1,622  Specialty Materials        Transportation Systems        Corporate   (211 )  (145 )  (204 )         $ 4,616  $ 4,097  $ 4,845        ##TABLE_END 27 A reconciliation of segment profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before taxes are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Years Ended December 31,           Segment Profit  $ 4,616  $ 4,097  $ 4,845  Other income/ (expense) (1)        Interest and other financial charges   (386 )  (459 )  (456 ) Stock compensation expense (2)   (164 )  (118 )  (128 ) Pension expense- ongoing (2)(3)   (189 )  (296 )   Pension mark to market adjustment (2)(3)   (471 )  (741 )  (3,290 ) Other postretirement income/(expense) (2)   (29 )    (135 ) Repositioning and other charges (2)   (600 )  (478 )  (1,012 )       Income before taxes (3)  $ 2,843  $ 2,049  $        ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  (1) Equity income/(loss) of affiliated companies is included in Segment Profit.

Our Aerospace products and services include auxiliary power units, propulsion engines, environmental control systems, electric power systems, engine controls, flight safety, communications, navigation, radar and surveillance systems, aircraft lighting, management and technical services, logistics services, advanced systems and instruments, aircraft wheels and brakes and repair and overhaul services. Aerospace sells its products to original equipment (OE) manufacturers in the air transport, regional, business and general aviation aircraft segments, and provides spare parts and repair and maintenance services for the aftermarket (principally to aircraft operators). The United States Government is also a major customer for our defense and space products.  Economic and Other Factors Aerospace operating results are principally driven by: ##TABLE_START   New aircraft production rates and delivery schedules set by commercial air transport, regional jet, business and general aviation OE manufacturers, as well as airline profitability, platform mix and retirement of aircraft from service; ##TABLE_END 29 ##TABLE_START   Global demand for commercial air travel as reflected in global flying hours and utilization rates for corporate and general aviation aircraft, as well as the demand for spare parts and maintenance and repair services for aircraft currently in use;      Level and mix of U.S. Government appropriations for defense and space programs and military activity; and      Availability and price volatility of raw materials such as titanium and other metals. ##TABLE_END Aerospace ##TABLE_START     Change   Change       Net sales  $ 10,683  $ 10,763   (1 )% $ 12,650   (15 )%                  Cost of products and services sold   8,099   8,099      9,426     Selling, general and administrative expenses              Other                    Segment profit  $ 1,835  $ 1,893   (3 )% $ 2,300   (18 )%       ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Factors Contributing to Year-Over-Year Change  2010 vs. 2009  2009 vs. 2008      Sales  Segment Profit  Sales  Segment Profit      Organic growth/ Operational segment profit   %  %  (13 )%  (18 )% Acquisitions and divestitures, net   %  %  (2 )%  (2 )% Other   (1 )%  (3 )%     %         Total % Change   (1 )%  (3 )%  (15 )%  (18 )%         ##TABLE_END Aerospace sales by major customer end-markets were as follows: ##TABLE_START   % of Aerospace Sales  % Change in Sales    Customer End-Markets     2010 Versus 2009  2009 Versus 2008        Commercial:                 Air transport and regional                 Original equipment   %  %  %  (2 )%  (21 )% Aftermarket   %  %  %  %  (16 )% Business and general aviation                 Original equipment   %  %  %  (27 )%  (51 )% Aftermarket   %  %  %  %  (27 )% Defense and Space   %  %  %  %  %           Total   %  %  %  (1 )%  (15 )%           ##TABLE_END 2010 compared with 2009 Aerospace sales decreased by 1 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to a 1 percent reduction of revenue related to amounts recognized for payments to business and general aviation original equipment manufacturers (OEM Payments) to partially offset their pre-production costs associated with new aircraft platforms. Details regarding the changes in sales by customer end-markets are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Air transport and regional original equipment (OE) sales decreased by 2 percent in 2010 primarily due to lower sales to our air transport OE customers. ##TABLE_END 30 ##TABLE_START   Air transport and regional aftermarket sales increased by 1 percent for 2010 primarily due to increased sales of spare parts driven by the impact of increased flying hours of approximately 6 percent in 2010.      Business and general aviation OE sales decreased by 27 percent in 2010 due to decreases in new business jet deliveries reflecting rescheduling and cancellations of deliveries by OE customers in the first six months and the impact of the OEM Payments discussed above.      Business and general aviation aftermarket sales increased by 8 percent in 2010 primarily due to increased sales of spare parts due to higher engine utilization, partially offset by lower revenue associated with licensing and maintenance service agreements.      Defense and space sales increased by 1 percent in 2010 primarily due to higher sales of logistics services partially offset by program wind-downs and completions and lower sales related to commercial helicopters. Changes in defense and space budgets and program delays are anticipated to impact the amount and timing of sales in this end-market in 2011. ##TABLE_END Aerospace segment profit decreased by 3 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to a negative 3 percent impact from the OEM payments, discussed above. Operational segment profit was flat in 2010 with the approximate positive 4 percent impact from price and productivity, net of inflation (including the absence of prior period labor cost actions offset by the benefits from prior repositioning actions) offset by an approximate negative 4 percent impact from lower sales volume. Cost of goods sold totaled $8.1 billion in 2010, unchanged from 2009. 2009 compared with 2008 Aerospace sales decreased by 15 percent in 2009. Details regarding the decrease in sales by customer end-markets are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Air transport and regional original equipment (OE) sales decreased by 21 percent in 2009. The decrease is driven by lower sales to our OE customers, consistent with production rates and platform mix, and the impact of divesting our Consumables Solutions business, partially offset by a 12 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 2009 mainly due to the absence of a strike at a major OEM in the fourth quarter of 2008.      Air transport and regional aftermarket sales decreased by 16 percent in 2009 primarily due to decreased sales of spare parts and lower maintenance activity driven by the impact of higher parked aircraft part utilization, customer inventory reductions initiatives and decreased flying hours of approximately 2 percent, including a 1 percent increase in the fourth quarter.      Business and general aviation OE sales decreased by 51 percent in 2009 due to the decreases in new business jet deliveries reflecting rescheduling and cancellations of deliveries by OE customers.      Business and general aviation aftermarket sales decreased by 27 percent in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of spare parts and lower revenue associated with maintenance service agreements, consistent with the decrease in business jet utilization. We started to see an increase in business jet utilization rates in the fourth quarter of 2009.      Defense and space sales were essentially unchanged in 2009, primarily due to higher sales of logistics services and original equipment for military platforms in the first nine months of 2009 offset by program completions. ##TABLE_END Aerospace segment profit decreased by 18 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to lower sales as a result of the factors discussed above and inflation, partially offset by volume related material cost reductions and reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work schedule reductions, benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation), the positive impact of cost savings initiatives and increased prices. 2011 Areas of Focus Aerospaces primary areas of focus for 2011 include: ##TABLE_START   Aligning inventory, production and research and development with improving customer demand and production schedules;      Expanding sales and operations in international locations;      Global pursuit of new defense and space programs;      Focus on cost structure initiatives to maintain profitability in face of evolving defense and space budgets and program specific appropriations;      Continuing to design equipment that enhances the safety, performance and durability of aerospace and defense equipment, while reducing weight and operating costs;      Delivering world-class customer service and achieving cycle and lead time reduction to improve responsiveness to customer demand; and      Continued deployment of our common enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. ##TABLE_END Automation and Control Solutions (ACS)  Overview ACS provides innovative products and solutions that make homes, buildings, industrial sites and infrastructure more efficient, safe and comfortable.

Sales in our Solutions businesses increased by 6 percent in 2010 primarily due to the positive impact of increased volume, acquisitions, net of divestitures (primarily the RMG Group), net of divestitures, higher prices and growth in energy efficiency projects and industrial field solutions driven by orders growth and conversion to sales from order backlog. Orders and backlog increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily driven by energy efficiency projects, refining and natural gas infrastructure projects and growth in emerging regions. ##TABLE_END ACS segment profit increased by 11 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 due to a 9 percent increase in operational segment profit and 2 percent increase from acquisitions. The increase in operational segment profit is comprised of an approximate 18 percent positive impact from higher sales volume, partially offset by an approximate 9 percent negative impact from inflation, net of price and productivity (including the absence of prior period labor cost actions, partially offset by the benefits of prior repositioning). Cost of goods sold totaled $9.3 billion in 2010, an increase of approximately $750 million which is primarily as a result of the factors discussed above. 2009 compared with 2008 ACS sales decreased by 10 percent in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to decreased sales volume (reflecting slower global economic growth) and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 4 percent, partially offset by a 3 percent growth from acquisitions. ##TABLE_START   Sales in our Products businesses decreased by 11 percent, including (i) lower volumes of sales in each of our businesses (excluding the impact of acquisitions) and (ii) the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Softness in residential and industrial end-markets was partially offset by the positive impact of acquisitions, most significantly Norcross Safety Products.      Sales in our Solutions businesses decreased by 9 percent primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and volume decreases largely due to softening demand as a result of customer ##TABLE_END 33 ##TABLE_START   deferral of capital and operating expenditures. Orders decreased while backlog increased in 2009. Decreased orders are primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, softening demand (as noted above) and order timing and delays. Higher backlog is primarily due to longer duration projects. The impact of these factors was partially offset by the positive impact of acquisitions, most significantly the RMG Group. ##TABLE_END ACS segment profit decreased by 2 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 principally due to the negative impact of lower sales as a result of the factors discussed above and inflation, partially offset by lower material costs, reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work schedule reductions, benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation) and the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives. In the fourth quarter of 2009 these factors more than offset the impact of lower sales described above resulting in a 5 percent increase in segment profit. 2011 Areas of Focus ACSs primary areas of focus for 2011 include: ##TABLE_START   Products and solutions for energy efficiency and asset management;      Extending technology leadership: lowest total installed cost and integrated product solutions;      Defending and extending our installed base through customer productivity and globalization;      Sustaining strong brand recognition through our brand and channel management;      Continued centralization and standardization of global software development capabilities;      Continuing to identify, execute and integrate acquisitions in or adjacent to the markets which we serve;      Continuing to establish and grow emerging markets presence and capability;      Continuing to invest in new product development and introductions; and      Continued deployment of our common ERP system. ##TABLE_END Specialty Materials Overview Specialty Materials develops and manufactures high-purity, high-quality and high-performance chemicals and materials for applications in the refining, petrochemical, automotive, healthcare, agricultural, packaging, refrigeration, appliance, housing, semiconductor, wax and adhesives segments. Specialty Materials also provides process technology, products and services for the petroleum refining, gas processing, petrochemical, renewable energy and other industries. Specialty Materials product portfolio includes fluorocarbons, hydrofluoroolefins, caprolactam, resins, ammonium sulfate for fertilizer, specialty films, waxes, additives, advanced fibers, customized research chemicals and intermediates, electronic materials and chemicals, catalysts, and adsorbents. Economic and Other Factors Specialty Materials operating results are principally driven by: ##TABLE_START   Level and timing of capital spending and capacity and utilization rates in refining and petrochemical end markets;      Degree of pricing volatility in raw materials such as benzene (the key component in phenol), fluorspar, natural gas, ethylene and sulfur;      Impact of environmental and energy efficiency regulations;      Extent of change in order rates from global semiconductor customers;      Global demand for non-ozone depleting Hydro fluorocarbons (HFCs);      Condition of the U.S. residential housing and non residential industries and automotive demand; ##TABLE_END 34 ##TABLE_START   Global demand for commodities such as caprolactam and ammonium sulfate; and      Increasing demand for renewable energy and biofuels. ##TABLE_END Specialty Materials ##TABLE_START     Change   Change       Net sales  $ 4,726  $ 4,144   % $ 5,266   (21 )% Cost of products and services sold   3,554   3,127      4,121     Selling, general and administrative expenses              Other                    Segment profit  $  $   % $   (16 )%       ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Factors Contributing to Year-Over-Year Change  2010 vs. 2009  2009 vs. 2008      Sales  Segment Profit  Sales  Segment Profit      Organic growth/ Operational segment profit   %  %  (20 )%  (14 )% Foreign exchange   %  (1 )%  (1 )%  (2 )%         Total % Change   %  %  (21 )%  (16 )%         ##TABLE_END 2010 compared with 2009 Specialty Materials sales increased by 14 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 predominantly due to organic growth. ##TABLE_START   Advanced Materials sales increased by 23 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily driven by (i) a 29 percent increase in Resins and Chemicals sales primarily due to higher prices driven by strong Asia demand, formula pricing arrangements and agricultural demand, (ii) a 21 percent increase in Specialty Products sales most significantly due to higher sales volume to our semiconductor, specialty additives, advanced fiber industrial applications and specialty chemicals customers, (iii) a 19 percent increase in our Fluorine Products business due to higher sales volume from increased demand for our refrigerants, insulating materials and industrial processing aids.      UOP sales decreased by 1 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily driven by lower new unit catalyst sales and timing of projects activity in the refining and petrochemical industries, partially offset by increased gas processing equipment sales. ##TABLE_END Specialty Materials segment profit increased by 24 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 due to a 25 percent increase in operational segment profit. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily due to a 24 percent positive impact from higher sales volumes. The positive impact from price and productivity was offset by the negative impact from inflation (including the absence of prior period labor cost actions). Cost of goods sold totaled $3.6 billion in 2010, an increase of approximately $400 million which is primarily as a result of the factors discussed above. 2009 compared with 2008 Specialty Materials sales decreased by 21 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily driven by (i) a 32 percent decrease in Resins and Chemicals sales due to substantial price declines arising from pass through of lower raw materials costs, partially offset by increased volume (most notably in the fourth quarter), (ii) a 19 percent decrease in UOP sales due to customer deferrals of projects as a result of reduced demand for additional capacity in the refining and petrochemical industries as well as lower catalyst sales, (iii) a 22 percent decrease in Specialty Products sales most significantly due to continued demand softness across key customer end-markets, and (iv) an 11 percent decrease in Fluorine Products sales due to lower volume sales of refrigerants and insulating materials principally driven by customer inventory reduction initiatives and soft construction and original equipment manufacturing end markets, partially offset by price increases. Specialty Materials segment profit decreased by 16 percent in 2009 compared with 2008. This decrease is principally due to lower sales as a result of the factors discussed above, partially offset by lower material costs, reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work schedule reductions and lower incentive compensation), the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives and increased prices. In the fourth quarter of 2009 these factors more than offset the impact of lower sales described above resulting in a 56 percent increase in segment profit. 2011 Areas of Focus Specialty Materials primary areas of focus for 2011 include: ##TABLE_START   Continuing to develop new processes, products and technologies that address energy efficiency, the environment and security, as well as position the portfolio for higher value;      Commercializing new products and technologies in the petrochemical, gas processing and refining industries and renewable energy sector;      Driving sales and marketing excellence and expand local presence in fast growing emerging markets;      Execution of awarded government projects;      Managing exposure to raw material commodity fluctuations; and      Investing to increase plant reliability and operational effectiveness, productivity, quality and operational excellence. ##TABLE_END Transportation Systems Overview Transportation Systems provides automotive products that improve the performance, efficiency, and appearance of cars, trucks, and other vehicles through state-of-the-art technologies, world class brands and global solutions to customers needs. Transportation Systems products include turbochargers and charge-air and thermal systems; car care products including anti-freeze (Prestone(R)), filters (Fram(R)), spark plugs (Autolite(R)), and cleaners, waxes and additives (Holts(R)); and brake hard parts and other friction materials (Bendix(R) and Jurid(R)). Transportation Systems sells its products to original equipment (OE) automotive and truck manufacturers (e.g., BMW, Caterpillar, Daimler, Renault, Ford, and Volkswagen), wholesalers and distributors and through the retail aftermarket. Economic and Other Factors Transportation Systems operating results are principally driven by: ##TABLE_START   Financial strength and stability of automotive OE manufacturers;      Global demand for automobile and truck production;      Turbo penetration rates for new engine platforms;      Global consumer preferences for boosted diesel passenger cars;      Degree of volatility in raw material prices, including nickel and steel;      New automobile production rates and the impact of customer inventory levels on demand for our products;      Regulations mandating lower emissions and improved fuel economy;      Consumers ability to obtain financing for new vehicle purchases; and      Automotive aftermarket trends such as consumer confidence, miles driven, and consumer preference for branded vs. private label aftermarket and car care products. ##TABLE_END 36 Transportation system ##TABLE_START     Change   Change                        Net sales  $ 4,212  $ 3,389   % $ 4,622   (27 )% Cost of products and services sold   3,433   2,928      3,847     Selling, general and administrative expenses              Other                    Segment profit  $  $   % $   (62 )%       ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Factors Contributing to Year-Over-Year Change  2010 vs. 2009  2009 vs. 2008      Sales  Segment Profit  Sales  Segment Profit       Organic growth/ Operational segment profit   %  %  (24 )%  (58 )% Foreign exchange   (1 )%  (3 )%  (3 )%  (4 )%         Total % Change   %  %  (27 )%  (62 )%         ##TABLE_END 2010 compared with 2009 Transportation Systems sales increased by 24 percent in 2010 compared with the 2009 primarily due to a 25 percent increase in organic revenue driven by increased sales volume, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 1 percent. ##TABLE_START   Turbo Technologies sales increased 31 percent primarily due to increased turbocharger sales to both light vehicle and commercial vehicle engine manufacturers partially offset by the negative impacts of foreign exchange. We expect increased volume to continue in 2011 as we benefit from new platform launches and continued strong diesel penetration rates in Western Europe.      Consumer Products Group (CPG) sales increased 7 percent, primarily due to higher prices (primarily pass through of ethylene glycol cost increases) and higher volume of antifreeze products in the fourth quarter. ##TABLE_END Transportation Systems segment profit increased by $317 million in 2010 compared with 2009 predominantly due to the positive impact from increased sales volume. Cost of goods sold totaled $3.4 billion in 2010, an increase of approximately $500 million which is also primarily a result of increased sales volume. 2009 compared with 2008 Transportation Systems sales decreased by 27 percent in 2009 compared with the 2008, primarily due to lower volumes (driven by the ongoing challenging global automotive industry conditions) and the negative impact of foreign exchange in the first nine months of 2009. ##TABLE_START   Turbo Technologies sales, including Friction Materials, decreased by 32 percent primarily due to lower sales volumes to both our commercial and light vehicle engine manufacturing customers and the negative impact of foreign exchange. Diesel penetration rates in Western Europe declined in the first nine months of 2009 and there was a shift in consumer preference towards lower displacement engines. Full year 2009 sales decline was partially offset by a 19 percent sales increase during the fourth quarter primarily due to the positive impact of foreign exchange and higher sales volumes to our light vehicle engine manufacturing customers.      CPG sales decreased by 8 percent primarily due to lower prices (primarily pass through of ethylene glycol cost decreases), lower volumes, and the negative impact of foreign exchange. ##TABLE_END Transportation Systems segment profit decreased by $ 250 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due principally to lower sales volume as a result of the factors discussed above partially offset by lower material costs, reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work schedule reductions, benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation) and the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives. In the fourth quarter of 2009 these factors and increased Turbo Technologies volumes resulted in a $66 million increase in Transportation Systems segment profit. 2011 Areas of Focus Transportation Systems primary areas of focus in 2011 include: ##TABLE_START   Sustaining superior turbocharger technology through successful platform launches;      Maintaining the high quality of current products while executing new product introductions;      Increasing global penetration and share of diesel and gasoline turbocharger OEM demand;      Increasing plant productivity to address capacity challenges generated by volatility in product demand and OEM inventory levels;      Aligning cost structure with current economic outlook, and successful execution of repositioning actions; and      Aligning development efforts and costs with new turbo platform launch schedules. ##TABLE_END Repositioning and Other Charges See Note 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of repositioning and other charges incurred in 2010, 2009, and 2008. Our repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of approximately $200 million in 2011 compared with 2010 principally from planned workforce reductions. Cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute our repositioning actions were $151, $200, and $157 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Such expenditures for severance and other exit costs have been funded principally through operating cash flows. Cash expenditures for severance and other costs necessary to execute the remaining actions will approximate a total of $150 million in 2011 and will be funded through operating cash flows. The following tables provide details of the pretax impact of total net repositioning and other charges by segment. ##TABLE_START   Years Ended December 31,           Aerospace           Net repositioning charge  $  $  $                     Years Ended December 31,           Automation and Control Solutions           Net repositioning charge  $  $  $                     Years Ended December 31,           Specialty Materials           Net repositioning charge  $  $  $  Probable and reasonably estimable environmental liabilities                  $  $  $                     Years Ended December 31,           Transportation Systems           Net repositioning charge  $  $  $  Asbestos related litigation charges, net of insurance        Probable and reasonably estimable environmental liabilities          Other                  $  $  $                     Years Ended December 31,           Corporate           Net repositioning charge  $   $   $  Asbestos related litigation charges, net of insurance         Probable and reasonably estimable environmental liabilities        Other       (3 )         $  $  $        ##TABLE_END LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets, as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables. We continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. Cash Flow Summary Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended 2010, 2009 and 2008, are summarized as follows: ##TABLE_START         Cash provided by (used for):           Operating activities  $ 4,203  $ 3,946  $ 3,791  Investing activities   (2,269 )  (1,133 )  (2,023 ) Financing activities   (2,047 )  (2,152 )  (1,370 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash   (38 )    (162 )       Net (decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents  $ (151 ) $  $        ##TABLE_END 2010 compared with 2009 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $257 million during 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to i) increased accrued expenses of $690 million (due to increased customer advances and incentive compensation accruals), ii) a $550 million impact from increased deferred taxes (excluding the impact of cash taxes), iii) increased net income of $474 million, iv) lower cash tax payments of approximately $300 million and v) a $219 million decrease in payments for repositioning and other charges, partially offset by a i) $1,059 unfavorable impact from working capital driven by higher receivables and increased purchases of raw materials and component inventory to support higher demand, partially offset by a corresponding increase to accounts payable, ii) increased pension and other postretirement payments of $598 million and iii) the absence of $155 million sale of long-term receivables in 2009. Cash used for investing activities increased by $1,136 million during 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $835 million (most significantly Sperian Protection, discussed below), and a net $341 million increase in investments in short-term marketable securities. Cash used for financing activities decreased by $105 million during 2010 compared to the 2009 primarily due to a decrease in the net repayment of debt (including commercial paper) of $287 million and an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock, primarily related to stock option exercises of $158 million, partially offset by the repayment of $326 million of debt assumed in the acquisition of Sperian Protection (see below). 2009 compared with 2008 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $155 million during 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to i) a favorable impact from working capital of $577 million (primarily due to a decrease in inventory of $479 million driven by reduced purchases of raw material and component inventory, lower production of finished goods in line with decreased sales volumes and inventory reduction initiatives across each of our segments), ii) lower cash tax payments of $449 million, iii) $155 million from the sale of long term receivables, iv) increased net income of $742 million and v) a $718 million impact from increased deferred income taxes (excluding the impact of cash tax payments noted above), partially offset by i) decreased pension expense of $2,312 million, ii) receipts from the sale of insurance receivables of $82 million in 2008, iii) a $56 million decreased impact from other current assets (most significantly lower receipts from insurance receivables) and iv) higher repositioning payments of $43 million. Cash used for investing activities decreased by $890 million during 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a $1,713 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions (most significantly the acquisition of Norcross and Metrolgic in 2008) and a $275 million decrease in expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, partially offset by a $908 million decrease in proceeds from sales of businesses (most significantly the divestiture of Consumables Solutions in 2008). Cash used for financing activities increased by $782 million during 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a net repayment of debt (including commercial paper) in 2009 of $1,272 million compared to net proceeds (including commercial paper) of $733 million in 2008 partially offset by a decrease in repurchases of common stock of $1,459 million. Liquidity Each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to improve working capital turnover in 2011 to increase operating cash flows. Considering the current economic environment in which each of our businesses operate and our business plans and strategies, including our focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that our cash balances and operating cash flows will remain our principal source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets, as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables. A source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing potential acquisitions. There was $299 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2010. Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2010, Standard and Poors (SP), Fitch, and Moodys have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 respectively, and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1 respectively. SP, Fitch and Moodys have Honeywells rating outlook as stable. To date, the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity. We maintain a $2.8 billion committed bank revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, including support for the issuance of commercial paper, which expires in mid-May 2012. At December 31, 2010, there were no borrowings or letters of credit issued under the credit facility. The credit facility does not restrict Honeywells ability to pay dividends, nor does it contain financial covenants. We expect to refinance the credit facility in 2011. In the first quarter of 2010, the Company repaid $1,000 million of its 7.50% notes. The repayment was funded with cash provided by operating activities. In October 2010, we completed the acquisition of the issued and outstanding shares of Sperian Protection (Sperian), a French company that operates globally in the personal protection equipment design and manufacturing industry. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was approximately $1,475 million, including the assumption of approximately $326 million of outstanding debt. We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions. As a source of liquidity, we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, none of the receivables in the designated pools had been sold to third parties. When we sell receivables, they are over-collateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that over-collateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools. The terms of the trade accounts receivable program permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion, providing us with an additional source of revolving credit. As a result, program receivables remain on the Companys balance sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as either Short-term borrowings or Long-term debt. We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Global economic conditions or a tightening of credit markets could adversely affect our customers or suppliers ability to obtain financing, particularly in our long-cycle businesses and airline and automotive end markets. Customer or supplier bankruptcies, delays in their ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing could adversely affect our cash flow or results of operations. To date we have not experienced material impacts from customer or supplier bankruptcy or liquidity issues. We continue to monitor and take measures to limit our exposure. In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions, share repurchases and any strategic acquisitions. Specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2011 to be as follows: ##TABLE_START   Capital expenditureswe expect to spend approximately $800 million for capital expenditures in 2011 primarily for cost reduction, maintenance, replacement, growth, and production and capacity expansion.      Debt repaymentsthere are $523 million of scheduled long-term debt maturities in 2011.      Share repurchasesThe Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $3 billion of Honeywell common stock, which amount includes $1.3 billion that remained available under the Companys previously reported share repurchase program. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time during 2011 to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including future option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating, financing and other investing activities.      Dividendswe expect to pay approximately $1,050 million in dividends on our common stock in 2011, reflecting a 1 percent increase in the number of shares outstanding and a 10 percent increase in the 2011 dividend rate.      Asbestos claimswe expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $162 and $50 million, respectively, in 2011. See Asbestos Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for further discussion.      Pension contributionsIn 2011, we are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements. However, in January 2011 we made a voluntary cash contribution of $1 billion to our U.S. plans to improve the funded status of the plans. During 2010, we made voluntary contributions of $600 million in cash and $400 million of Honeywell common stock to our U.S. pension plans, as well as $242 million of marketable securities to our non-U.S. pension plans, to improve the funded status of our plans. See Note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of pension contributions. In addition, the Company is evaluating additional voluntary contributions in 2011 and currently expects to contribute a portion of the proceeds from the sale of its Consumer Products Group business (discussed below) to our U.S. Pension plans. The timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors, including the rate of return on plan assets and discount rates.      Repositioning actionswe expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the previously announced repositioning actions will approximate $150 million in 2011.      Environmental remediation costswe expect to spend approximately $325 million in 2011 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs. See Environmental Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for additional information. ##TABLE_END We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2008 we realized $909 million in cash proceeds from sales of non-strategic businesses. In January 2011, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Consumer Products Group business (CPG) to Rank Group Limited for approximately $950 million. The sale, which is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2011. We currently estimate that the transaction will result in a pre-tax gain of approximately $350 million, approximately $200 million net of tax. The sale of CPG, within the Transportation Systems segment, is consistent with the Companys strategic focus on its portfolio of differentiated global technologies. In July 2008, the Company completed the sale of its Consumables Solutions business to B/E Aerospace (B/E) for $1.05 billion, consisting of approximately $901 million in cash and six million shares of B/E common stock. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, this transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $623 million, $417 million net of tax. These proceeds, along with our other sources and uses of liquidity, as discussed above, were utilized to invest in our existing core businesses and fund acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines, access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. Based on our current financial position and expected economic performance. Contractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments Following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2010: ##TABLE_START   Payments by Period     Total(6)   2012- 2013  2014- 2015  Thereafter       Long-term debt, including capitalized leases (1)  $ 6,278  $  $ 1,022  $  $ 4,125  Interest payments on long-term debt, including capitalized leases   2,844         1,804  Minimum operating lease payments   1,353          Purchase obligations (2)   1,856          Estimated environmental liability payments (3)            Asbestos related liability payments (4)   1,719          Asbestos insurance recoveries (5)   (875 )  (50 )  (133 )  (176 )  (516 )                              $ 13,928  $ 2,515  $ 3,496  $ 1,677  $ 6,240            ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity.   (2) Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements.   (3) The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2010. See Environmental Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for additional information.   (4) These amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2010. NARCO estimated payments are based on the terms and conditions, including evidentiary requirements, specified in the definitive agreements or agreements in principle and pursuant to Trust Distribution Procedures. Projecting the timing of NARCO payments is dependent on, among other things, the effective date of the Trust which could cause the timing of payments to be earlier or later than that projected. Bendix payments are based on our estimate of pending and future claims. Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause asbestos liabilities to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. See Asbestos Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for additional information.   (5) These amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos related liabilities as of December 31, 2010. The timing of insurance recoveries are impacted by the terms of insurance settlement agreements, as well as the documentation, review and collection process required to collect on insurance claims. Where probable insurance recoveries are not subject to definitive settlement agreements with specified payment dates, but instead are covered by insurance policies, we have assumed collection will occur beyond 2015. Projecting the timing of insurance recoveries is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the amounts collected to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded or could cause the timing of collections to be earlier or later than that projected. We reevaluate our projections concerning insurance recoveries in light of any changes or developments that would impact recoveries or the timing thereof. See Asbestos Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for additional information. ##TABLE_END 43 ##TABLE_START (6) The table excludes $757 million of uncertain tax positions. See Note 6 to the financial statements.   The table also excludes our pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) obligations. In January 2011, we made a voluntary cash contribution of $1 billion to our U.S. plans to improve the funded status of our plans. In addition, the company is evaluating additional voluntary contributions in 2011. We also expect to make contributions to our non-U.S. plans of approximately $55 million in 2011. Beyond 2011, the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations. Payments due under our OPEB plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans. We expect our OPEB payments to approximate $188 million in 2011 net of the benefit of approximately $13 million from the Medicare prescription subsidy. See Note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of our pension and OPEB plans. ##TABLE_END Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Following is a summary of our off-balance sheet arrangements: Guarantees We have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at December 31, 2010: ##TABLE_START   Maximum Potential Future Payments   Operating lease residual values  $  Other third parties financing    Unconsolidated affiliates financing    Customer financing        $    ##TABLE_END We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination, if any, existing on the date of disposition. Such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly, with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters. It is our policy (see Note 1 to the financial statements) to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. Remedial response and voluntary cleanup payments were $266, $318 and $320 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008 , respectively, and are currently estimated to be approximately $325 million in 2011. We expect to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow. Remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were $225, $151 and $466 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008 , respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the recorded liabilities for environmental matters was $753 and $779 million, respectively. In addition, in 2010 and 2009 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $86 and $73 million, respectively, relating to compliance with environmental regulations. Although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. See Note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies, including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation. Financial Instruments As a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. A summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in Note 1 to the financial statements. We also hold investments in marketable equity securities, which exposes us to market volatility, as discussed in Note 16 to the financial statements. We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade. Our objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency cash flows. We attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties. Our principal currency exposures relate to the U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Mexican peso, Swiss franc, Czech koruna, Chinese renminbi, Indian rupee, Singapore dollar and Swedish krona. Our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our net debt and pension obligations. As described in Notes 14 and 16 to the financial statements, we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs. Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and expected future cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. The following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one-percentage-point increase in interest rates across all maturities, the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities, and the potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent decrease in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities at December 31, 2010 and 2009. ##TABLE_START   Face or Notional Amount  Carrying Value (1)  Fair Value (1)  Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value      December 31, 2010              Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments              Long-term debt (including current maturities)  $ 6,278  $ (6,278 ) $ (6,835 ) $ (399 ) Interest rate swap agreements         (18 ) Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments              Foreign currency exchange contracts (2)   5,733        Commodity Price Sensitive Instruments              Forward commodity contracts (3)           (4 ) December 31, 2009              Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments              Long-term debt (including current maturities)  $ 7,264  $ (7,264 ) $ (7,677 ) $ (421 ) Interest rate swap agreements     (2 )  (2 )  (23 ) Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments              Foreign currency exchange contracts (2)   2,959        Commodity Price Sensitive Instruments              Forward commodity contracts (3)         (10 ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   (1) Asset or (liability).    (2) Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions.    (3) Changes in the fair value of forward commodity contracts are offset by changes in the cash flows of underlying hedged commodity transactions. ##TABLE_END The above discussion of our procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from our sensitivity analyses are forward-looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. The methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and our Independent Registered Public Accountants. New accounting standards effective in 2010 which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements are described in the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section in Note 1 to the financial statements.  Contingent Liabilities We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. For a discussion of our contingencies related to environmental, asbestos and other matters, including managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities, see Notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements. Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries We are a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos (refractory and friction products). We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions, including evidentiary requirements, in definitive agreements or agreements in principle with current claimants. We also accrued for the probable value of future NARCO asbestos related claims through 2018 based on the disease criteria and payment values contained in the NARCO trust as described in Note 21 to the financial statements. In light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections regarding claims filing rates and disease manifestation, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims based on expected claim resolution values and historic dismissal rates. We also accrued for the estimated cost of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on our assessment of additional claims that may be brought against us and anticipated resolution values in the tort system. We value Bendix pending and future claims using the average resolution values for the previous five years. We will continue to update the expected resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future Bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year. For additional information see Note 21 to the financial statements. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers, our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers, various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers. At December 31, 2010, we have recorded insurance receivables of $718 million that can be specifically allocated to NARCO related asbestos liabilities. We also have $1.9 billion in coverage remaining for Bendix related asbestos liabilities although there are gaps in our coverage due to insurance company insolvencies, certain uninsured periods and insurance settlements. Our insurance is with both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. See Note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities. Defined Benefit Pension Plans  We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. In 2010, we elected to change our method of recognizing pension expense. Previously, for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans we used the market-related value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a three-year period. Further, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor) were recognized over a six-year period. Under our new accounting method which we adopted in 2010, we will recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment). This new accounting method results in faster recognition of net actuarial gains and losses than our previous amortization method. Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change as they may each year. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets. This accounting method also results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM adjustments. MTM adjustments were $471, $741 and $3,290 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The remaining components of pension expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, will be recorded on a quarterly basis (On-going Pension Expense). See Note 1 to the financial statements for further details of the change and the impact of our retrospective application of the new policy. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historic and expected plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations (see Note 22 to the financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. Further information on all our major actuarial assumptions is included in Note 22 to the financial statements. The key assumptions used in developing our 2010, 2009 and 2008 net periodic pension expense for our U.S. plans included the following: ##TABLE_START            Discount rate   5.75 %  6.95 %  6.50 % Assets:           Expected rate of return   %  %  % Actual rate of return   %  %  (29 %) Actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return   %  %  % ##TABLE_END The discount rate can be volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We will use a 5.25 percent discount rate in 2011, reflecting the decrease in the market interest rate environment since December 31, 2009. We will use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 8 percent for 2011 down from 9 percent in 2010 due to lower future expected market returns. In addition to the potential for MTM adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future on-going pension expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and on-going expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM adjustment: ##TABLE_START       Change in Assumption  Impact on 2011 On-Going Pension Expense  Impact on PBO     0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate  Decrease $8 million  Increase $390 million  0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate  Increase $6 million  Decrease $380 million  0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets  Increase $30 million    0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets  Decrease $30 million    ##TABLE_END On-going pension expense for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately $110 million in 2011, a decrease of $79 million from 2010, due primarily to a voluntary contribution of $1 billion in cash to our U.S. pension plans in January 2011 and strong 2010 asset returns. Also, if required, an MTM adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 in accordance with our new pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM adjustment in 2011, and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our U.S. pension plans. However, we made voluntary contributions of $1,000, $740 and $242 million to our U.S. pension plans in 2010, 2009 and 2008 , respectively, primarily to improve the funded status of our plans which had deteriorated during 2008 due to the significant asset losses resulting from the poor performance of the equity markets. In 2011, we are still not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements. However, in January 2011 we made a voluntary cash contribution of $1 billion to our U.S. plans to improve the funded status of our plans. In addition, the Company is evaluating additional voluntary contributions in 2011. The timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors, including the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate. We also expect to contribute approximately $55 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2011 to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Long-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets) To conduct our global business operations and execute our business strategy, we acquire tangible and intangible assets, including property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets. At December 31, 2010, the net carrying amount of these long-lived assets totaled $7.0 billion. The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not these assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review are as follows: ##TABLE_START   significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations;      annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line;      significant negative industry or economic trends; and      significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. ##TABLE_END Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 in the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates, our assumptions as to volume, selling prices and costs, and the discount rate selected. As described in more detail in Note 16 to the financial statements, we have recorded impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $30 and $28 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment in facilities scheduled to close or be downsized. Goodwill Impairment Testing Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing. Our Goodwill balance, $11.6 billion as of December 31, 2010 , is subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value is reduced to fair value. The fair value of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. This impairment test involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions. We completed our annual impairment test as of March 31, 2010 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. However, significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units. Income Taxes  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances, including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions. As of December 31, 2010, we recognized a net deferred tax asset of $2,015 million, less a valuation allowance of $636 million. Net deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of net deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods. The determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. The projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs. Additionally, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws. Our net deferred tax asset of $2,015 million consists of $1,254 million related to U.S. operations and $761 million related to non-U.S. operations. The U.S. net deferred tax asset of $1,254 million consists of net deductible temporary differences, tax credit carryforwards, federal and state tax net operating losses which we believe will more likely than not be realized through the generation of future taxable income in the U.S. and tax planning strategies. We maintain a valuation allowance of $3 million against such asset related to state net operating losses. The non-U.S. net deferred tax asset of $761 million consists principally of net operating and capital loss carryforwards, mainly in the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany. We maintain a valuation allowance of $634 million against these deferred tax assets reflecting our historical experience and lower expectations of taxable income over the applicable carryforward periods. As more fully described in Note 6 to the financial statements, our valuation allowance increased by $58 million in 2010 and increased by $133 million and decreased by $45 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income in the period that such determination is made. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, as defined by the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Sales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts In 2010, we recognized approximately 14 percent of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts in our Automation and Control Solutions, Aerospace and Specialty Materials segments. These long-term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.

N OTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) ##TABLE_END Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Accounting Principles The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is a description of the significant accounting policies of Honeywell International Inc.  Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. Our consolidation policy requires equity investments that we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investees activities to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.  Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit and highly liquid, temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less.  Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out or the average cost method and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for certain qualifying domestic inventories.  Investments Investments in affiliates over which we have a significant influence, but not a controlling interest, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Other investments are carried at market value, if readily determinable, or at cost. All equity investments are periodically reviewed to determine if declines in fair value below cost basis are other-than-temporary. Significant and sustained decreases in quoted market prices or a series of historic and projected operating losses by investees are strong indicators of other-than-temporary declines. If the decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment loss is recorded and the investment is written down to a new carrying value.  Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding assets useful life. See Note 11 and Note 17 for additional details.  Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2010 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. See Note 12 for additional details on goodwill balances.  Other Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years.  Long-Lived Assets We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with determinable lives) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate events or changes in circumstances based on a number of factors including operating results, business plans and forecasts, general and industry trends and, economic projections and anticipated cash flows. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in earnings. We also continually evaluate the estimated useful lives of all long-lived assets and periodically revise such estimates based on current events.  Sales Recognition Product and service sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities in our Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments, are recognized over ##TABLE_START HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) ##TABLE_END the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts in the Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments are recorded on a percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident. Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis. Amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses as a result of customers inability to make required payments. We estimate anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on days past due, as measured from the contractual due date, historical collection history and incorporate changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in historical trends for example, customers in bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization. Receivables are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are determined uncollectible. Such determination includes analysis and consideration of the particular conditions of the account, including time intervals since last collection, success of outside collection agencies activity, solvency of customer and any bankruptcy proceedings.  Environmental Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and that do not provide future benefits, are expensed as incurred. Liabilities are recorded when environmental remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities.  Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries Honeywell is a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos (refractory and friction products). We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrue for pending claims based on terms and conditions, including evidentiary requirements, in definitive agreements or agreements in principle with current claimants. We also accrue for the probable value of future NARCO asbestos related claims through 2018 based on the disease criteria and payment values contained in the NARCO trust as described in Note 21. In light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections regarding claims filing rates and disease manifestation, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrue for the estimated value of pending claims based on expected claim resolution values and historic dismissal rates. We also accrue for the estimated cost of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on our assessment of additional claims that may be brought against us and anticipated resolution values in the tort system. We value Bendix pending and future claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We will continue to update the expected resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future Bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year. For additional information see Note 21. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers, our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers, various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers.  Aerospace Sales Incentives We provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of our aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and braking system hardware and auxiliary power units, for installation on commercial aircraft. These incentives principally consist of free or deeply discounted products, but also include credits for future purchases of product and upfront cash payments. These costs are recognized in the period incurred as cost of products sold or as a reduction to sales, ##TABLE_START HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) ##TABLE_END as appropriate. For aircraft manufacturers, incentives are recorded when the products are delivered; for airlines, incentives are recorded when the associated aircraft are delivered by the aircraft manufacturer to the airline.  Research and Development Research and development costs for company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred. Such costs are principally included in Cost of Products Sold and were $1,466, $1,330 and $1,543 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Stock-Based Compensation Plans The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 20, include non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs). The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant in order to estimate the portion of the award that will ultimately vest. The estimate is based on our historical rates of forfeiture.  Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage to eligible retirees. In 2010 we elected to change our method of recognizing pension expense. Previously, for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans we used the market-related value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a three-year period and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor) were recognized over a six-year period. Under our new accounting method, we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment). The remaining components of pension expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, will be recorded on a quarterly basis (On-going Pension Expense). While the historical policy of recognizing pension expense was considered acceptable, we believe that the new policy is preferable as it eliminates the delay in recognition of actuarial gains and losses outside the corridor. This change has been reported through retrospective application of the new policy to all periods presented. The impacts of all adjustments made to the financial statements are summarized below: Consolidated Statement of Operations ##TABLE_START   Year Ended December 31, 2009     Previously Reported  Revised  Effect of Change     Cost of products sold   18,637   19,317    Cost of services sold   4,548   4,695    Selling, general and administrative expenses   4,341   4,443    Income before taxes   2,978   2,049   (929 ) Tax expense       (324 ) Net income   2,189   1,584   (605 ) Net income attributable to Honeywell   2,153   1,548   (605 ) Earnings per share of common stock-basic   2.86   2.06   (0.80 ) Earnings per share of common stock-assuming dilution   2.85   2.05   (0.80 ) ##TABLE_END 59 ##TABLE_START HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings.  Derivative Financial Instruments As a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. ##TABLE_START HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) ##TABLE_END Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract. All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item.  Transfers of Financial Instruments  Sales, transfers and securitization of financial instruments are accounted for under authoritative guidance for the transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities. We sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. The terms of the trade accounts receivable program permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion. As a result, these program receivables are not accounted for as a sale and remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as either Short-term borrowings or Long-term debt. At times we also transfer trade and other receivables that qualify as a sale and are thus are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the time they are sold. The value assigned to any subordinated interests and undivided interests retained in receivables sold is based on the relative fair values of the interests retained and sold. The carrying value of the retained interests approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the collection period for the receivables.  Income Taxes Deferred tax liabilities or assets reflect temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting. Such amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the amount of a valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. The projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs. Additionally, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, as defined by the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the tax filings of the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.  Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding.  Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary.  Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. ##TABLE_START HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) ##TABLE_END  Recent Accounting Pronouncements Changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the form of accounting standards updates (ASUs) to the FASBs Accounting Standards Codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets. The guidance requires additional disclosures for transfers of financial assets and changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets. The guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities. The guidance affects the overall consolidation analysis and requires enhanced disclosures on involvement with variable interest entities. The guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In October 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the accounting and disclosure for revenue recognition. These amendments, effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 (early adoption is permitted), modify the criteria for recognizing revenue in multiple element arrangements and the scope of what constitutes a non-software deliverable. The Company has elected to early adopt this guidance, on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after January 1, 2010. The implementation of this amended accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations in the period of adoption. Adoption impacts in future periods will vary based upon the nature and volume of new or materially modified transactions but are not expected to have a significant impact on sales. Note 2Acquisitions and Divestitures We acquired businesses for an aggregate cost of $1,303, $468 and $2,181 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For all of our acquisitions the acquired businesses were recorded at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Significant acquisitions made in these years are discussed below. In October 2010, we completed the acquisition of the issued and outstanding shares of Sperian Protection (Sperian), a French company that operates globally in the personal protection equipment design and manufacturing industry. Sperian had reported 2009 revenues of approximately $900 million. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was approximately $1,475 million (including the assumption of approximately $326 million of outstanding debt) and was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date. ##TABLE_START HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START      Accounts and other receivables  $  Inventories    Other current assets    Property, plant and equipment    Intangible assets    Other assets and deferred charges    Accounts payable   (63 ) Accrued liabilities   (104 ) Deferred income taxes   (214 ) Long-term debt   (326 ) Other long-term liabilities   (64 )   Net assets acquired    Goodwill      Purchase price  $ 1,149    ##TABLE_END We have assigned $619 million to intangible assets, predominantly customer relationships, trade names, and technology. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives which range from 3 to 20 years using straight line and accelerated amortization methods. Included in this amount, a value of approximately $203 million has been assigned to trade names intangibles determined to have indefinite lives. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is approximately $898 million and was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill arises primarily from the avoidance of the time and costs which would be required (and the associated risks that would be encountered) to develop a business with a product offering and customer base comparable to Sperian and the expected cost synergies that will be realized through the consolidation of the acquired business into our Automations and Controls Solutions segment. These cost synergies are expected to be realized principally in the areas of selling, general and administrative expenses, material sourcing and manufacturing. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2010 are included in the Automation and Control Solutions segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2010, the purchase accounting for Sperian is subject to final adjustment primarily for useful lives of intangible assets, amounts allocated to intangible assets and goodwill, for certain pre-acquisition contingencies, and for settlement of post-closing purchase price adjustments. In August 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of the RMG Group (RMG Regel + Messtechnik GmbH), a natural gas measuring and control products, services and integrated solutions company, for a purchase price of approximately $416 million, net of cash acquired. The purchase price for the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The Company has assigned $174 million to identifiable intangible assets, predominantly customer relationships, existing technology and trademarks. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives which range from 1 to 15 years using straight-line and accelerated amortization methods. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired (approximating $225 million), was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. This acquisition was accounted for by the acquisition method, and, accordingly, results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2009 are included in the Automation and Control Solutions segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. In May 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of Safety Products Holding, Inc, which through its subsidiary Norcross Safety Products L.L.C. (Norcross) is a leading manufacturer of personal protective equipment. The purchase price, net of cash acquired, was approximately $1,221 million and was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date. ##TABLE_START HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives which range from 1 to 20 years using straight line and accelerated amortization methods. The value assigned to the trade names of approximately $257 million is classified as an indefinite lived intangible. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired (approximately $604 million) was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. This acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method, and, accordingly, results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2008 are included in the Automation and Control Solutions segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. In July 2008, the Company completed the sale of its Consumables Solutions business to B/E Aerospace (B/E) for $1,050 million, consisting of approximately $901 million in cash and six million shares of B/E common stock. In connection with the completion of the sale, the Company and B/E entered into, among other things, exclusive supply and license agreements and a stockholder agreement. Because of the extent of the Companys cash flows associated with the supply and license agreements, the Consumables Solutions business is not classified as discontinued operations. The provisions of the license and supply agreements were determined to be at-market. As such, we have not allocated any portion of the proceeds to these agreements. The pre-tax gain of $623 million was classified as Other (Income)/Expense in our Statement of Operations. The gain on sale was approximately $417 million net of tax. The sale of the Consumables Solutions business, within the Aerospace segment, is consistent with the Companys strategic focus on core product areas utilizing advanced technologies. In July 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of Metrologic Instruments, Inc. (Metrologic), a leading manufacturer of data capture and collection hardware and software, for a purchase price of approximately $715 million, net of cash acquired. The purchase price for the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at acquisition date. The Company has assigned $248 million to identifiable intangible assets, predominantly customer relationships, technology and trademarks. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives which range from 1-15 years using straight line and accelerated amortization methods. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired (approximately $440 million) was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. This acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method, and, accordingly, results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2008, are included in the Automation and Control Solutions segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. In January 2011, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Consumer Products Group business (CPG) to Rank Group Limited for approximately $950 million. The sale, which is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2011. We currently estimate that the transaction will result in a pre-tax gain of approximately $350 million, approximately $200 million net of tax. The sale of CPG, within the Transportation Systems segment, is consistent with the Companys strategic focus on its portfolio of differentiated global technologies. In connection with all acquisitions in 2010, 2009 and 2008, the amounts recorded for transaction costs and the costs of integrating the acquired businesses into Honeywell were not material. ##TABLE_START HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) ##TABLE_END The pro forma results for 2010, 2009 and 2008, assuming these acquisitions had been made at the beginning of the year, would not be materially different from consolidated reported results.

The workforce reductions were primarily related to the planned shutdown of certain manufacturing facilities in our Automation and Control Solutions and Transportation Systems segments, cost savings actions taken in connection with our ongoing functional transformation and productivity initiatives, factory transitions in our Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions and Specialty Materials segments to more cost-effective locations, achieving acquisition-related synergies in our Automation and Control Solutions segment, and the exit and/or rationalization of certain product lines in our Specialty Materials segment. The repositioning charge also included asset impairments of $22 million principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment associated with the exit and/or rationalization of certain product lines and in facilities scheduled to close. Also, $30 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance at our Automation and Control Solutions, Transportation Systems and Aerospace segments, were returned to income in 2010 due to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with prior severance programs. ##TABLE_START HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) ##TABLE_END In 2009, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $224 million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 4,423 manufacturing and administrative positions mainly in our Automation and Control Solutions, Transportation Systems and Aerospace segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to the adverse market conditions experienced by many of our businesses, cost savings actions taken in connection with our ongoing functional transformation initiative, the planned downsizing or shutdown of certain manufacturing facilities, and organizational realignments of portions of our Aerospace and Transportation Systems segments. Also, $53 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance at our Automation and Control Solutions, Aerospace, and Transportation Systems segments, were returned to income in 2009 due to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with prior severance programs and changes in the scope of previously announced repositioning actions. In 2008, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $444 million including severance costs of $333 million related to workforce reductions of 7,480 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our segments. The workforce reductions primarily relate to the planned downsizing or shutdown of certain manufacturing facilities in our Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions and Transportation Systems segments, the rationalization of non-manufacturing infrastructure, outsourcing of non-core components, managing capacity utilization to address product demand volatility and our functional transformation initiative. The repositioning charge also included asset impairments of $78 million principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment in facilities scheduled to close or be downsized and certain administrative facilities, and information technology equipment in our Corporate segment. Also, $20 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance at our Automation and Control Solutions segment were returned to income in 2008 due mainly to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with prior severance programs.

We also recognized other charges of $62 million in connection with the evaluation of potential resolution of certain legal matters. In 2009, we recognized a charge of $145 million for environmental liabilities deemed probable and reasonably estimable during the year. We recognized asbestos related litigation charges, net of insurance, of $155 million. In 2008, we recognized a charge of $465 million for environmental liabilities deemed probable and reasonably estimable during the year, of which $309 million was recognized in the third quarter which included: ##TABLE_START   $100 million related to the resolution of technical design issues regarding the remediation plan for Onondaga Lake (Lake) (as previously reported, the ultimate cost of the remediation of the Lake depended upon the resolution of these issues);      $90 million for the estimated cost of proposed remedial actions to be taken at other sites located in Syracuse, New York in accordance with remediation plans submitted to state environmental regulators; and      $38 million primarily related to changes in cost estimates (due to, among other things, increases in the cost of steel, waste transportation and disposal costs) and settlement costs relating to the remediation of the New Jersey Chrome sites known as Study Areas 5, 6 and 7. ##TABLE_END We also recognized asbestos related litigation charges, net of insurance, of $125 million. ##TABLE_START HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

The Company obtained control and the ability to direct those activities most significant to the joint ventures economic performance in the third quarter, resulting in consolidation. Accordingly, we have i) recognized the assets and liabilities at fair value, ii) included the results of operations in the consolidated financial statements from the date of consolidation and iii) recognized the above noted gain representing the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of our previously held equity method investment. The Company has assigned $24 million to intangibles, predominantly the joint ventures customer contracts. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives using the straight line method. The excess of the book value over the estimated fair values of the net assets consolidated approximating $132 million, was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. The results from the consolidation date through December 31, 2010 are included in the Specialty Materials segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. Gain on sale of non-strategic businesses and assets for 2009 includes a $50 million pre-tax gain, $42 million net of tax, related to the deconsolidation of a subsidiary within our Automation and Control Solutions segment. The subsidiary achieved contractual milestones at December 31, 2009 and as a result, we are no longer the primary beneficiary, resulting in deconsolidation. We continue to hold a non-controlling interest which was recorded at its estimated fair value of $67 million upon deconsolidation. The fair value was estimated using a combination of a market and income approaches utilizing observable market data for comparable businesses and discounted cash flow modeling. Our non-controlling interest, classified within Investments and long-term receivables on our Balance Sheet will be accounted for under the equity method on a prospective basis. Other, net for 2009 includes an other than-temporary impairment charge of $62 million. See Note 16 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures for further details. Gain on sale of non-strategic businesses and assets for 2008 includes a $623 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of our Consumables Solutions business. See Note 2 for further details.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) ##TABLE_END The effective tax rate increased by 5.7 percentage points in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings related to lower U.S. pension expense, the impact of an enacted change in the tax treatment of the Medicare Part D program, the absence of manufacturing incentives, a decreased impact from the settlement of audits and an increase in the foreign effective tax rate. The foreign effective tax rate increased by approximately 7 percentage points which primarily consisted of i) a 6 percentage point impact from the absence of tax benefits related to foreign exchange and investment losses and ii) a 0.5 percentage point impact from increased valuation allowances on net operating losses. The effective tax rate increased by 60.4 percentage points in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a decrease in the mix of earnings related to lower U.S. pension expense and to a lesser extent, a decreased impact from the settlement of audits. Deferred tax assets (liabilities) Deferred income taxes represent the future tax effects of transactions which are reported in different periods for tax and financial reporting purposes. The tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which give rise to future income tax benefits and payables are as follows:  ##TABLE_START   December 31,         Property, plant and equipment basis differences  $ (1,113 ) $ (888 ) Postretirement benefits other than pensions and post employment benefits      Investment and other asset basis differences   (993 )  (758 ) Other accrued items   2,348   3,024  Net operating and capital losses      Tax credits      Undistributed earnings of subsidiaries   (40 )  (40 ) All other itemsnet     (61 )        2,015   3,017  Valuation allowance   (636 )  (578 )       $ 1,379  $ 2,439      ##TABLE_END There were $35 million of U.S. federal tax net operating losses available for carryforward at December 31, 2010 which were generated by certain subsidiaries prior to their acquisition and have expiration dates through 2029. The use of pre-acquisition operating losses is subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. We do not anticipate that these limitations will affect utilization of the carryforwards prior to their expiration. The Company has state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $3.2 billion at December 31, 2010 with varying expiration dates through 2030. We also have foreign net operating and capital losses of $2.8 billion which are available to reduce future income tax payments in several countries, subject to varying expiration rules. We have U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards of $311 million at December 31, 2010, including foreign tax credits, research and other general business credits with various expiration dates through 2030. We also have state tax credit carryforwards of $64 million at December 31, 2010, including carryforwards of $37 million with various expiration dates through 2025 and tax credits of $27 million which are not subject to expiration. The valuation allowance against deferred tax assets increased by $58 million and $133 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and decreased by $45 million in 2008. The 2010 increase in the valuation allowance was primarily due to increased foreign net operating losses related to France, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands offset by the reversal of a valuation allowance related to Germany. The 2010 increase in valuations allowance also includes adjustments related to purchase accounting for various acquisitions. The 2009 increase in the valuation allowance was primarily due to a increased foreign net operating losses related to Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. The 2008 decrease in the valuation allowance was primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance related to federal and state capital loss carryforwards partially offset by increased foreign net operating losses. ##TABLE_START HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) ##TABLE_END Federal income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of the majority of our international subsidiaries as it is our intention to reinvest these earnings into the respective subsidiaries. At December 31, 2010 Honeywell has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $6.0 billion of such earnings of our non-U.S. operations. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and foreign tax credits would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability. We had $757 million, $720 million and $671 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 respectively. If recognized, $757 million would be recorded as a component of income tax expense as of December 31, 2010. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company increased its unrecognized tax benefits by $37 million and $49 million, respectively, due to additional reserves for various international and U.S. tax audit matters, partially offset by adjustments related to our ongoing assessments of the likelihood and amount of potential outcomes of current and future examinations, the expiration of various statute of limitations, and settlements with tax authorities. The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START         Change in unrecognized tax benefits:           Balance at beginning of year  $  $  $  Gross increases related to current period tax positions        Gross increases related to prior periods tax positions        Gross decreases related to prior periods tax positions   (41 )  (77 )  (54 ) Decrease related to settlements with tax authorities   (23 )  (44 )  (42 ) Expiration of the statute of limitations for the assessment of taxes   (8 )  (8 )  (64 ) Foreign currency translation   (12 )    (22 )       Balance at end of year  $  $  $        ##TABLE_END In many cases our uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities.

In addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods. Based on the number of tax years currently under audit by the relevant U.S federal, state and foreign tax authorities, the Company anticipates that several of these audits may be finalized in the foreseeable future. However, based on the status of these examinations, the protocol of finalizing audits by the relevant taxing authorities, and the possibility that the Company might challenge certain audit findings (which could include formal legal proceedings), at this time it is ##TABLE_START HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) ##TABLE_END not possible to estimate the impact of any amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits for examinations in progress were $274 million, $261 million and $249 million, as of December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. These increases are primarily due to an increase in tax examinations and fewer settlements during the year. Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of Tax Expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and totaled $33 million, $13 million and $19 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties were $183 million, $150 million and $137 million, as of December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the quantity of inventory valued using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method in our Specialty Materials segment declined.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) We maintain a $2,800 million five year committed revolving credit facility with a group of banks, arranged by Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P.Morgan Securities Inc. which is in place through May 14, 2012. This credit facility contains a $700 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit. The credit facility is maintained for general corporate purposes, including support for the issuance of commercial paper. We had no borrowings outstanding or letters of credit issued under the credit facility at December 31, 2010. The credit agreement does not restrict our ability to pay dividends and contains no financial covenants. The failure to comply with customary conditions or the occurrence of customary events of default contained in the credit agreement would prevent any further borrowings and would generally require the repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement. Such events of default include: (a) non-payment of credit agreement debt, interest or fees; (b) non-compliance with the terms of the credit agreement covenants; (c) cross-default to other debt in certain circumstances; (d) bankruptcy; and (e) defaults upon obligations under Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Additionally, each of the banks has the right to terminate its commitment to lend additional funds or issue letters of credit under the agreement if any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 30 percent or more of our voting stock, or, during any 12-month period, individuals who were directors of Honeywell at the beginning of the period cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors. Loans under the credit facility are required to be repaid no later than May 14, 2012. We have agreed to pay a facility fee of 0.05 percent per annum on the aggregate commitment. Interest on borrowings under the credit facility would be determined, at Honeywells option, by (a) an auction bidding procedure; (b) the highest of the floating base rate publicly announced by Citibank, N.A., 0.5 percent above the average CD rate, or 0.5 percent above the Federal funds rate; or (c) the Eurocurrency rate plus 0.15 percent (applicable margin). The facility fee, the applicable margin over the Eurocurrency rate and the letter of credit issuance fee, are subject to change, based upon a grid determined by our long term debt ratings. The credit agreement is not subject to termination based upon a decrease in our debt ratings or a material adverse change. In February 2009, the Company issued $600 million 3.875% Senior Notes due 2014 and $900 million 5.00% Senior Notes due 2019 (collectively, the 2009 Senior Notes). The 2009 Senior Notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywells existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of Honeywells subordinated debt. The offering resulted in gross proceeds of $1,500 million, offset by $12 million in discount and issuance costs. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company repaid $493 million of its floating rate notes. In the third quarter of 2009, the Company repaid $500 million of its floating rate notes and $100 million of its zero coupon bonds and money multiplier notes. In the first quarter of 2010, the Company repaid $1,000 million of its 7.50% notes. The repayment was funded with cash provided by operating activities. As a source of liquidity, we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 none of the receivables in the designated pools had been sold to third parties. When we sell receivables, they are over-collateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that over-collateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools. The terms of the trade accounts receivable program permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion, providing us with an additional source of revolving credit. As a result, program receivables remain on the Companys balance sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as either Short-term borrowings or Long-term debt. Note 15Lease Commitments Future minimum lease payments under operating leases having initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows: HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) ##TABLE_START   At December 31, 2010    $              Thereafter        $ 1,353    ##TABLE_END We have entered into agreements to lease land, equipment and buildings. Principally all our operating leases have initial terms of up to 25 years, and some contain renewal options subject to customary conditions. At any time during the terms of some of our leases, we may at our option purchase the leased assets for amounts that approximate fair value. We do not expect that any of our commitments under the lease agreements will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Rent expense was $373, $371 and $383 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Note 16Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Credit and Market Risk Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers. Foreign Currency Risk Management We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. Our objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency denominated cash flows. We attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts with third parties. We hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in Other (Income) Expense. We partially hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which predominantly occur in the next twelve months and are denominated in non-functional currencies, with currency forward contracts. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the currency forward contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. Open foreign currency exchange forward contracts mature predominantly in the next twelve months. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had contracts with notional amounts of $5,733 million and $2,959 million respectively to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Mexican peso, Swiss franc, Czech koruna, Chinese renminbi, Indian rupee, Singapore dollar, and Swedish krona. Commodity Price Risk Management Our exposure to market risk for commodity prices can result in changes in our cost of production. We primarily mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk through the use of long-term, fixed-price contracts with our suppliers and formula price agreements with suppliers and customers. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) We also enter into forward commodity contracts with third parties designated as hedges of anticipated purchases of several commodities. Forward commodity contracts are marked-to-market, with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had contracts with notional amounts of $23 million and $52 million respectively related to forward commodity agreements, principally base metals and natural gas. Interest Rate Risk Management We use a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively changed $600 million of fixed rate debt at a rate of 3.875 percent to LIBOR based floating debt. Our interest rate swaps mature in 2014. Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The FASBs accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The FASBs guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy: ##TABLE_START  Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  Level 2  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or    Unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or    Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability  Level 3  Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability ##TABLE_END The Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company has determined that our available for sale investments are level 1 and our remaining financial assets and liabilities are level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2010 and 2009: ##TABLE_START   December 31,         Assets:        Foreign currency exchange contracts  $  $  Available for sale investments      Interest rate swap agreements      Forward commodity contracts              Liabilities:        Foreign currency exchange contracts  $  $  Interest rate swap agreements       Forward commodity contracts       ##TABLE_END The foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate swap agreements, and forward commodity contracts are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds investments in marketable equity securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale and are valued using market transactions in over-the-counter markets. As such, these investments are classified within level 2. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value.

These assets were tested for impairment and based on the fair value of these assets the Company recognized losses of $30 million and $28 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, primarily in connection with our repositioning actions (see Note 3 Repositioning and Other Charges). The Company has determined that the fair value measurements of these nonfinancial assets are level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company holds investments in marketable equity securities that are designated as available for sale securities. Due to an other-than-temporary decline in fair value of these investments, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $62 million in the second quarter of 2009 that is included in Other (Income) Expense. The derivatives utilized for risk management purposes as detailed above are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and impacted the Statement of Operations as follows: Fair value of derivatives classified as assets consist of the following: ##TABLE_START     December 31,   Designated as a Hedge  Balance Sheet Classification        Foreign currency exchange contracts  Accounts, notes, and other receivables  $  $  Interest rate swap agreements  Other assets      Commodity contracts  Accounts, notes, and other receivables                    December 31,   Not Designated as a Hedge  Balance Sheet Classification        Foreign currency exchange contracts  Accounts, notes, and other receivables  $  $            Fair value of derivatives classified as liabilities consist of the following:               December 31,   Designated as a Hedge  Balance Sheet Classification        Foreign currency exchange contracts  Accrued liabilities  $  $  Interest rate swap agreements  Accrued liabilities       Commodity contracts  Accrued liabilities                     December 31,   Not Designated as a Hedge  Balance Sheet Classification        Foreign currency exchange contracts  Accrued liabilities  $  $  ##TABLE_END 80 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or (losses) on the derivative recognized in Interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt being hedged. Gains or (losses) on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $24 and $(2) million in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 respectively. We also economically hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts. These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. We recognized $18 million and $85 million of expense, in Other (Income) Expense for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Common shareowners do not have preemptive or conversion rights. Shares of common stock issued and outstanding or held in the treasury are not liable to further calls or assessments. There are no restrictions on us relative to dividends or the repurchase or redemption of common stock. The Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $3.0 billion of Honeywell common stock, which amount includes $1.3 billion that remained available under the Companys previously reported share repurchase program. We are authorized to issue up to 40,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value, and can determine the number of shares of each series, and the rights, preferences and limitations of each series. At December 31, 2010, there was no preferred stock outstanding.

Under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (the Plan), a maximum of 43 million shares of Honeywell common stock may be awarded. Additionally, under the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (the Directors Plan) 500,000 shares of Honeywell common stock may be awarded.  Stock Options The exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under our stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of our stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employees requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Honeywell common stock. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The expected term represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Compensation cost on a pre-tax basis related to stock options recognized in operating results (included in selling, general and administrative expenses) in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $55, $39 and $51 million, respectively. The associated future income tax benefit recognized in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $16, $13 and $19 million, respectively. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

There were 21,512,252 shares available for future grants under the terms of our stock option plans at December 31, 2010. The total intrinsic value of options (which is the amount by which the stock price exceeded the exercise price of the options on the date of exercise) exercised during 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $54, $4 and $76 million, respectively. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $181, $20 and $134 million, respectively, with an associated tax benefit realized of $18, $1 and $28 million, respectively. In 2010, 2009 and 2008 we classified $13, $1 and $21 million, respectively, of this benefit as a financing cash inflow in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and the balance was classified as cash from operations. At December 31, 2010, there was $94 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock option awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.43 years. The total fair value of options vested during 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $41, $51 and $63 million, respectively.  Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock unit (RSU) awards entitle the holder to receive one share of common stock for each unit when the units vest. RSUs are issued to certain key employees at fair market value at the date of grant as compensation. RSUs typically become fully vested over periods ranging from three to seven years and are payable in Honeywell common stock upon vesting.

Compensation expense related to RSUs was $109, $79 and $77 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.  Non-Employee Directors Plan Under the Directors Plan each new director receives a one-time grant of 3,000 restricted stock units that will vest on the fifth anniversary of continuous Board service. The Directors Plan also provides for an annual grant to each director of options to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock at the fair market value on the date of grant. Options generally become exercisable over a four-year period and expire after ten years. Note 21Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded liabilities for environmental costs: ##TABLE_START   Years Ended December 31,           Beginning of year  $  $  $  Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable        Environmental liability payments              (266 )  (318 )  (320 ) Other               End of year  $  $  $        ##TABLE_END  HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that these environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.  New Jersey Chrome Sites The excavation and offsite disposal of approximately one million tons of chromium residue present at a predecessor Honeywell site located in Jersey City, New Jersey, known as Study Area 7 was completed in January 2010. We have also received approval of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey for the implementation of related groundwater and sediment remedial actions, and are seeking the appropriate permits from state and federal agencies. Provisions have been made in our financial statements for the estimated cost of these remedies. The above-referenced site is the most significant of the 21 sites located in Hudson County, New Jersey that are the subject of an Administrative Consent Order (ACO) entered into with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) in 1993 (the Honeywell ACO Sites). Remedial investigations and activities consistent with the ACO have also been conducted and are underway at the other Honeywell ACO Sites. We have recorded reserves for the Honeywell ACO Sites where appropriate under the accounting policy described above. On May 3, 2005, NJDEP filed a lawsuit in New Jersey Superior Court against Honeywell and two other companies seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages, and the reimbursement of unspecified total costs relating to sites in New Jersey allegedly contaminated with chrome ore processing residue. The claims against Honeywell relate to the activities of a predecessor company which ceased its New Jersey manufacturing operations in the mid-1950s. Honeywell and the two other companies have agreed to settle this litigation with NJDEP, subject to Court approval. Under the settlement, Honeywell would pay $5 million of NJDEPs past costs, as well as accept sole responsibility to remediate 24 of the 53 Publicly Funded Sites (i.e., those sites for which none of the three companies had previously accepted responsibility). Honeywell would also bear 50% of the costs at another 10 Publicly Funded Sites. We have recorded reserves for the Publicly Funded Sites where appropriate under the accounting policy described above. We have entered into court-approved settlements of litigation filed in federal court against Honeywell and other landowners seeking the cleanup of chrome residue at groups of properties known as Study Areas 5, 6 South and 6 North of the Honeywell ACO Sites. The required remedial actions are consistent with our recorded reserves.  Dundalk Marine Terminal, Baltimore, MD Chrome residue from legacy chrome plant operations in Baltimore was deposited as fill at the Dundalk Marine Terminal (DMT), which is owned and operated by the Maryland Port Administration (MPA). Honeywell and the MPA have been sharing costs to investigate and mitigate related environmental issues, and have entered into a cost sharing agreement under which Honeywell will bear 77 percent of the costs of developing and implementing permanent remedies for the DMT facility. In January 2011, the MPA and Honeywell submitted to the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) a Corrective Measures Alternatives Analysis (CMAA) of certain potential remedies for DMT to assist MDE in selection of a final remedy. Provision has been made in our financial statements for the CMAA consistent with the accounting policy described above. We have negotiated a Consent Decree with the MPA and MDE with respect to the investigation and remediation of the DMT facility. The Consent Decree is being challenged in federal court by BUILD, a Baltimore community group, together with a local church and two individuals (collectively BUILD). In October 2007, the Court dismissed with prejudice BUILDs state law claims and dismissed without prejudice BUILDs RCRA claims regarding neighborhoods near the DMT facility. In August 2008, the Court held a hearing on the Companys motion to dismiss BUILDs remaining claims on the grounds that MDE is diligently prosecuting the investigation and remediation of the DMT. We are awaiting the Courts decision. We do not believe that this HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) matter will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or operating cash flows. Given the scope and complexity of this project, it is possible that the cost of remediation, when determinable, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the periods recognized.  Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, NY We are implementing a combined dredging/capping remedy of Onondaga Lake pursuant to a consent decree approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York in January 2007. We have accrued for our estimated cost of remediating Onondaga Lake based on currently available information and analysis performed by our engineering consultants. Honeywell is also conducting remedial investigations and activities at other sites in Syracuse. We have recorded reserves for these investigations and activities where appropriate under the accounting policy described above. Honeywell has entered into a cooperative agreement with potential natural resource trustees to assess alleged natural resource damages relating to this site. It is not possible to predict the outcome or duration of this assessment, or the amounts of, or responsibility for, any damages. Asbestos Matters Like many other industrial companies, Honeywell is a defendant in personal injury actions related to asbestos. We did not mine or produce asbestos, nor did we make or sell insulation products or other construction materials that have been identified as the primary cause of asbestos related disease in the vast majority of claimants. Products containing asbestos previously manufactured by Honeywell or by previously owned subsidiaries primarily fall into two general categories: refractory products and friction products.  Refractory Products Honeywell owned North American Refractories Company (NARCO) from 1979 to 1986. NARCO produced refractory products (high temperature bricks and cement) that were sold largely to the steel industry in the East and Midwest. Less than 2 percent of NARCOS products contained asbestos. When we sold the NARCO business in 1986, we agreed to indemnify NARCO with respect to personal injury claims for products that had been discontinued prior to the sale (as defined in the sale agreement). NARCO retained all liability for all other claims. On January 4, 2002, NARCO filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the NARCO bankruptcy filing, all of the claims pending against NARCO are automatically stayed pending the reorganization of NARCO. In addition, the bankruptcy court enjoined both the filing and prosecution of NARCO-related asbestos claims against Honeywell. The stay has remained in effect continuously since January 4, 2002. In connection with NARCOs bankruptcy filing, we paid NARCOs parent company $40 million and agreed to provide NARCO with up to $20 million in financing. We also agreed to pay $20 million to NARCOs parent company upon the filing of a plan of reorganization for NARCO acceptable to Honeywell (which amount was paid in December 2005 following the filing of NARCOs Third Amended Plan of Reorganization), and to pay NARCOs parent company $40 million, and to forgive any outstanding NARCO indebtedness to Honeywell, upon the effective date of the plan of reorganization. We believe that, as part of the NARCO plan of reorganization, a trust will be established for the benefit of all asbestos claimants, current and future, pursuant to Trust Distribution Procedures negotiated with the NARCO Asbestos Claimants Committee and the Court-appointed legal representative for future asbestos claimants. If the trust is put in place and approved by the Court as fair and equitable, Honeywell as well as NARCO will be entitled to a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based on exposure to NARCO products to be made against the federally-supervised trust. Honeywell has reached agreement with the representative for future NARCO claimants and the Asbestos Claimants Committee to cap its annual contributions to the trust with respect to future claims at a level that would not have a material impact on Honeywells operating cash flows. In November 2007, the Bankruptcy Court entered an amended order confirming the NARCO Plan without modification and approving the 524(g) trust and channeling injunction in favor of NARCO and Honeywell. In December 2007, certain insurers filed an appeal of the Bankruptcy Court Order in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court Order in July 2008. In August 2008, insurers filed a notice of appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal is fully briefed, oral argument took place on May 21, 2009, and the matter was submitted for decision. In connection with the settlement of an insurance coverage litigation matter, the insurer appellants withdrew their appeal regarding the NARCO Plan. On August 3, 2010 the Third Circuit Court of Appeals entered an order formally dismissing the NARCO appeal. The NARCO Plan of Reorganization cannot become effective, however, until the resolution of an appeal of the Chapter 11 proceedings of NARCO affiliates. The Third Circuit reheard this appeal en banc on October 13, 2010. It is not possible to predict when the Court will rule on this appeal. We expect that the stay HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) enjoining litigation against NARCO and Honeywell will remain in effect until the effective date of the NARCO Plan of Reorganization. Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for settlement of pending and future NARCO-related asbestos claims of $1,125 million and $1,128 million as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. The estimated liability for pending claims is based on terms and conditions, including evidentiary requirements, in definitive agreements with approximately 260,000 current claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. Substantially all settlement payments with respect to current claims have been made. Approximately $100 million of payments due pursuant to these settlements is due only upon establishment of the NARCO trust. The estimated liability for future claims represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury claims expected to be asserted against NARCO through 2018 and the aforementioned obligations to NARCOs parent. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond 2018. The estimate is based upon the disease criteria and payment values contained in the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures negotiated with the NARCO Asbestos Claimants Committee and the NARCO future claimants representative. Honeywell projected the probable number and value, including trust claim handling costs, of asbestos related future liabilities based upon experience of asbestos claims filing rates in the tort system and in certain operating asbestos trusts, and the claims experience in those forums. The valuation methodology also includes an analysis of the population likely to have been exposed to asbestos containing products, epidemiological studies to estimate the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases, NARCO claims filing history, the pending inventory of NARCO asbestos related claims and payment rates expected to be established by the NARCO trust. This methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims has been commonly accepted by numerous courts and resulted in a range of estimated liability for future claims of $743 to $961 million. We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, our consolidated financial statements reflect an insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of pending and future NARCO-related asbestos claims of $718 and $831 million, respectively. This coverage reimburses Honeywell for portions of the costs incurred to settle NARCO related claims and court judgments as well as defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. At December 31, 2010, a significant portion of this coverage is with insurance companies with whom we have agreements to pay full policy limits based on corresponding Honeywell claims costs. We conduct analyses to determine the amount of insurance that we estimate is probable of recovery in relation to payment of current and estimated future claims. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. We made judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings with our insurers, our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers and various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs. In the second quarter of 2006, Travelers Casualty and Insurance Company (Travelers) filed a lawsuit against Honeywell and other insurance carriers in the Supreme Court of New York, County of New York, disputing obligations for NARCO-related asbestos claims under high excess insurance coverage issued by Travelers and other insurance carriers. In July 2010, the Company entered into a settlement agreement resolving all asbestos coverage issues with certain plaintiffs. Approximately $180 million of unsettled coverage under these policies is included in our NARCO-related insurance receivable at December 31, 2010. Honeywell believes it is entitled to the coverage at issue and expects to prevail in this matter. In the third quarter of 2007, Honeywell prevailed on a critical choice of law issue concerning the appropriate method of allocating NARCO-related asbestos liabilities to triggered policies. The plaintiffs appealed and the trial courts ruling was upheld by the intermediate appellate court in the second quarter of 2009. Plaintiffs further appeal to the New York Court of Appeals, the highest court in New York, was denied in October 2009. A related New Jersey action brought by Honeywell has been dismissed, but all coverage claims against plaintiffs have been preserved in the New York action. Based upon (i) our understanding of relevant facts and applicable law, (ii) the terms of insurance policies at issue, (iii) our experience on matters of this nature, and (iv) the advice of counsel, we believe that the amount due from Travelers and other insurance carriers is probable of recovery. While Honeywell expects to prevail in this matter, an adverse outcome could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period recognized but would not be material to our consolidated financial position or operating cash flows. Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the NARCO related asbestos liabilities or assets to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. There is no assurance that the plan of reorganization will become final, that insurance recoveries will be timely or whether there will be any NARCO HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) related asbestos claims beyond 2018. Given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future events, we review our estimates periodically, and update them based on our experience and other relevant factors. Similarly, we will reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability or other developments that may impact insurance recoveries.  Friction Products Honeywells Bendix friction materials (Bendix) business manufactured automotive brake parts that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form. Existing and potential claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of individuals who performed brake replacements. From 1981 through December 31, 2010, we have resolved approximately 155,000 Bendix related asbestos claims. We had 131 trials resulting in favorable verdicts and 18 trials resulting in adverse verdicts. Four of these adverse verdicts were reversed on appeal, five verdicts were vacated on post-trial motions, three claims were settled and the remaining have been or will be appealed. The claims portfolio was reduced in 2009 due to settlements, dismissals and the elimination of significantly aged (i.e., pending for more than six years), inactive (including claims for which the required medical and exposure showings have not been made) and duplicate claims. The following tables present information regarding Bendix related asbestos claims activity: ##TABLE_START    Years Ended December 31,   Claims Activity        Claims Unresolved at the beginning of year   19,940   51,951  Claims Filed (a)   4,302   2,697  Claims Resolved (b)   (1,762 )  (34,708 )     Claims Unresolved at the end of year   22,480   19,940      ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  (a) The number of claims filed in 2010 includes approximately 1,541 non-malignant claims (with an accrued liability of approximately $575 thousand in the aggregate), a majority of which had previously been dismissed in Mississippi and re-filed in Arkansas.    (b) The number of claims resolved in 2010 includes approximately 1,300 claims previously classified as inactive (95% non-malignant and accrued liability of approximately $2.0 million) which were activated during the current period. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    December 31,   Disease Distribution of Unresolved Claims        Mesothelioma and Other Cancer Claims   4,856   4,727  Other Claims   17,624   15,213      Total Claims   22,480   19,940      ##TABLE_END Honeywell has experienced average resolution values per claim excluding legal costs as follows: ##TABLE_START      Year Ended December 31,          2006            (in whole dollars)  Malignant claims  $ 54,000  $ 50,000  $ 65,000  $ 33,000  $ 33,000  Nonmalignant claims  $ 1,300  $  $ 1,500  $  $ 250  ##TABLE_END It is not possible to predict whether resolution values for Bendix related asbestos claims will increase, decrease or stabilize in the future. Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of pending and future HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Bendix related asbestos claims of $594 and $566 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. Our liability for the estimated cost of future Bendix related asbestos claims is based on historic claims filing experience, disease classifications, expected resolution values, and historic dismissal rates. In the fourth quarter of each year, we update our analysis of the estimated cost of future Bendix related asbestos claims. We have valued Bendix pending and future claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. Changes in the tort system, which began in 2006, refocused asbestos litigation on mesothelioma cases, making the five year period 2006 through 2010 representative for forecasting purposes. We will continue to update the expected resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future Bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year. The estimated liability for future claims represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury claims expected to be asserted against Bendix over the next five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. The estimate is based upon Bendix historical experience in the tort system for the five years ended December 31, 2010 with respect to claims filing and resolution values. The methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims has been commonly accepted by numerous courts. It is similar to that used to estimate the future NARCO related asbestos claims liability. Honeywell currently has approximately $1,900 million of insurance coverage remaining with respect to pending and potential future Bendix related asbestos claims, of which $157 and $172 million are reflected as receivables in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. This coverage is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the liability for the estimated value of the underlying asbestos claims. The amount of the insurance receivable recorded is based on our ongoing analysis of the insurance that we estimate is probable of recovery. This determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the solvency of our insurers, our interpretation of judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with our insurers. Insurance receivables are also recorded when structured insurance settlements provide for future fixed payment streams that are not contingent upon future claims or other events. Such amounts are recorded at the net present value of the fixed payment stream. On a cumulative historical basis, Honeywell has recorded insurance receivables equal to approximately 41 percent of the value of the underlying asbestos claims recorded. However, because there are gaps in our coverage due to insurance company insolvencies, certain uninsured periods, and insurance settlements, this rate is expected to decline for any future Bendix related asbestos liabilities that may be recorded. Future recoverability rates may also be impacted by numerous other factors, such as future insurance settlements, insolvencies and judicial determinations relevant to our coverage program, which are difficult to predict. Assuming continued defense and indemnity spending at current levels, we estimate that the cumulative recoverability rate could decline over the next five years to approximately 35 percent. Honeywell believes it has sufficient insurance coverage and reserves to cover all pending Bendix related asbestos claims and Bendix related asbestos claims estimated to be filed within the next five years. Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of either pending or future Bendix related asbestos claims, we do not believe that such claims would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position in light of our insurance coverage and our prior experience in resolving such claims. If the rate and types of claims filed, the average resolution value of such claims and the period of time over which claim settlements are paid (collectively, the Variable Claims Factors) do not substantially change, Honeywell would not expect future Bendix related asbestos claims to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in any fiscal year. No assurances can be given, however, that the Variable Claims Factors will not change.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Other Matters We are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Included in these other matters are the following:  Allen, et al. v. Honeywell Retirement Earnings Plan Pursuant to a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona in February 2008, 18 of 21 claims alleged by plaintiffs in this class action lawsuit were dismissed with prejudice in exchange for approximately $35 million and the maximum aggregate liability for the remaining three claims (alleging that Honeywell impermissibly reduced the pension benefits of certain employees of a predecessor entity when the plan was amended in 1983 and failed to calculate benefits in accordance with the terms of the plan) was capped at $500 million. Any amounts payable, including the settlement amount, have or will be paid from the Companys pension plan. In October 2009, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Honeywell Retirement Earnings Plan with respect to the claim regarding the calculation of benefits. We continue to expect to prevail on the remaining claims in light of applicable law and our substantial affirmative defenses, which have not yet been considered fully by the Court. Accordingly, we do not believe that a liability is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable with respect to these claims and we have not recorded a provision for the remaining claims in our financial statements.  Quick Lube On March 31, 2008, SE Quick Lube, a filter distributor, filed suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut alleging that twelve filter manufacturers, including Honeywell, engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices, rig bids and allocate U.S. customers for aftermarket automotive filters. This suit is a purported class action on behalf of direct purchasers of filters from the defendants. Parallel purported class actions, including on behalf of indirect purchasers of filters, have been filed by other plaintiffs in a variety of jurisdictions in the United States and Canada. The U.S cases have been consolidated into a single multi-district litigation in the Northern District of Illinois. We intend to vigorously defend the claims raised in these actions. The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice notified Honeywell on January 21, 2010 that it has officially closed its investigation into possible collusion in the replacement auto filters industry.  BorgWarner v. Honeywell In this patent infringement suit in the District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, plaintiff BorgWarner is claiming that Honeywells manufacture and sale of cast titanium compressor wheels for turbochargers infringes three BorgWarner patents and is seeking damages of up to approximately $120 million, which plaintiff asserts should be trebled for willful infringement. Because the process claimed in BorgWarners patents had already been described in detail in printed publications and had been offered for sale before BorgWarners alleged invention, in violation of statutory requirements for patentability, Honeywell asked the Court to enter summary judgment of invalidity of BorgWarners patents. The Court declined to enter summary judgment in September 2010, finding that the question should be decided by a jury. Trial is scheduled for May 2011. Honeywell will continue its vigorous defense of this claim and expects to prevail at trial. In the event the Company is found liable, we do not believe that the evidence supports damages of the magnitude claimed or any finding of willfulness. Honeywell has also asked the United States Patent and Trademark Office to reexamine all three of BorgWarners patents in light of the prior art publications. If the Patent Office ultimately invalidates the BorgWarner patents at issue prior to final adjudication of the patent infringement litigation, plaintiff would not be entitled to recover damages. Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations (including the specific matters referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters. Considering our past experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. Warranties and Guarantees We have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at December 31, 2010: HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Pension benefits for substantially all U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. U.S. defined benefit pension plans comprise 77 percent of our projected benefit obligation. Non-U.S. employees, who are not U.S. citizens, are covered by various retirement benefit arrangements, some of which are considered to be defined benefit pension plans for accounting purposes. Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans comprise 23 percent of our projected benefit obligation. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage to eligible retirees. Our retiree medical plans mainly cover U.S. employees who retire with pension eligibility for hospital, professional and other medical services. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell after January 1, 2000 are not eligible to participate in our retiree medical and life insurance plans. Most of the U.S. retiree medical plans require deductibles and copayments, and virtually all are integrated with Medicare. Retiree contributions are generally required based on coverage type, plan and Medicare eligibility. Honeywell has limited its subsidy of its retiree medical plans to a fixed-dollar amount for all future retirees and for more than half of its current retirees. This cap of retiree medical benefits under our plans limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. During the third quarter of 2010, Honeywell amended its U.S. retiree medical plan to no longer offer certain post-age-65 retirees Honeywell group coverage and facilitate their purchase of an individual plan in the Medicare marketplace. This plan amendment reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $137 million which will be recognized as part of net periodic postretirement benefit cost over the average future service period to full eligibility of the remaining active union employees still eligible for a retiree medical subsidy. On February 1, 2010, in connection with a new collective bargaining agreement reached with one of its union groups, Honeywell amended its U.S. retiree medical plan eliminating the subsidy for those union employees who retire after February 1, 2013. This plan amendment reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $39 million which will be recognized as part of net periodic postretirement benefit cost over the average future service period to full eligibility of the remaining active union employees still eligible for a retiree medical subsidy. This plan amendment also resulted in a curtailment gain of $37 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 which was included as part of net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The curtailment gain represents the recognition of previously unrecognized prior service credits attributable to the future years of service of the union group for which future accrual of benefits has been eliminated. In May 2009, Honeywell amended the U.S. retiree medical plan eliminating the subsidy for active non-union employees who retire after September 1, 2009. Employees already retired or who retired on or before September 1, 2009 were not affected by this change. This plan amendment reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $180 million representing the elimination of benefits attributable to years of service already rendered by active non-union employees who are not eligible to retire and those eligible non-union employees who were assumed not to retire prior to September 1, 2009. This reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation will be recognized as part of net periodic postretirement benefit cost over the average future service period to full eligibility of the remaining active union employees still eligible for a retiree medical subsidy. This plan amendment also resulted in a curtailment gain of $98 million in the second quarter of 2009 which was included as part of net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The curtailment gain represented the recognition of previously unrecognized prior service credits attributable to the future years of service of the employee group for which future accrual of benefits was eliminated.

To determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of double A rated fixed-income debt instruments. We use the average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations. Our expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets is a long-term rate based on historic plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations. We will use an expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 8% for 2011 down from 9% for 2010 due to lower future expected market returns. We review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. For non-U.S. benefit plans, none of which was individually material, assumptions reflect economic assumptions applicable to each country. Pension Benefits Included in the aggregate data in the tables above are the amounts applicable to our pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets. Amounts related to such plans were as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 31,     U.S. Plans  Non-U.S. Plans              Projected benefit obligation  $ 14,990  $ 13,620  $ 1,990  $ 3,539  Accumulated benefit obligation  $ 14,260  $ 12,758  $ 1,883  $ 3,344  Fair value of plan assets  $ 12,181  $ 10,306  $ 1,474  $ 2,721  ##TABLE_END The accumulated benefit obligation for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans was $14.3 and $12.8 billion and our Non-U.S. defined benefit plans were $4.1 and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our asset investment strategy for our U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve our long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. Our actual invested positions in various securities change over time based on short and longer-term investment opportunities. To achieve our objectives, we have established long-term target allocations as follows: 60-70 percent equity securities, 10-20 percent fixed income securities and cash, 5-15 percent real estate investments, and 10-20 percent other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located both inside and outside the United States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies. We review our assets on a regular basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations. Our non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing standard funding and investment guidance. Local regulations, local funding rules, and local financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. While our non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country, the long-term investment objectives are generally the same as those for the U.S. pension assets. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgages, asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in commingled funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private equity, debt and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate are valued based on annual independent appraised values. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts Our general funding policy for qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans, however, we made voluntary contributions of $1,000, $740 and $242 million, respectively, primarily to improve the funded status of our plans. During 2011, we are still not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans, however, in January 2011 we made a voluntary cash contribution of $1 billion to improve the funded status of our plans. In 2010, we contributed marketable securities valued at $242 million to one of our non-U.S. plans. In 2011, we also expect to contribute approximately $55 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards and to fund benefits to be paid directly from Company assets. Benefit payments, including amounts to be paid from Company assets, and reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows: ##TABLE_START   U.S. Plans  Non-U.S. Plans     $  $    1,015      1,019      1,036      1,081    2016-2020   5,172   1,039  ##TABLE_END Other Postretirement Benefits The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) provides subsidies for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug coverage that is at least actuarially equivalent to that offered by Medicare Part D. The March 2010 enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including modifications made in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 resulted in a one-time, non-cash charge of $13 million related to income taxes in the first quarter of 2010.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2010 the Company has changed its method of accounting for defined benefit pension costs. All periods have been retroactively restated for this accounting change. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey February 11, 2011 ##TABLE_START ", "9A": " I tem 9A.

Our sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers were 6, 6 and 7 percent of our total sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 11 percent of our total sales in each of 2011, 2010 and 2009. Our Aerospace results of operations can be impacted by various industry and economic conditions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. U.S. Government Sales Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by our Aerospace segment), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $4,276, $4,354 and $4,288 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a prime contractor and subcontractor, of $3,374, $3,500 and $3,455 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Base U.S. defense spending (excludes Overseas Contingent Operations) was essentially flat in 2011 compared to 2010. Although we expect a slight decline in our defense and space revenue in 2012 (see Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), we do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2012 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEM production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs) as well as our diversified commercial businesses. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to audits, investigations, and termination by the government. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. Backlog Our total backlog at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $16,160 and $14,616 million, respectively. We anticipate that approximately $12,018 million of the 2011 backlog will be filled in 2012. We believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option. Competition We are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas. Competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions. Competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us, and vary by country. Our businesses compete on a variety of factors, such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. A number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies, some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers. See Item 1A Risk Factors for further discussion. International Operations We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development globally. U.S. exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 12, 11 and 12 percent of our total sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Foreign manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 43, 42 and 40 percent of our total sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Approximately 18 percent of total 2011 sales of Aerospace-related products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products and systems and performance of services such as aircraft repair and overhaul. Exports were principally made to Europe, Asia, Canada, and Latin America. Foreign manufactured products and systems and performance of services comprised approximately 15 percent of total 2011 Aerospace sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Canada and Asia. Approximately 3 percent of total 2011 sales of Automation and Control Solutions products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Foreign manufactured products and performance of services accounted for 58 percent of total 2011 Automation and Control Solutions sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe and Asia, with less significant operations in Canada and Australia. Approximately 34 percent of total 2011 sales of Performance Materials and Technologies products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Exports were principally made to Asia and Latin America. Foreign manufactured products and performance of services comprised 25 percent of total 2011 Performance Materials and Technologies sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Asia. Approximately 3 percent of total 2011 sales of Transportation Systems products were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Foreign manufactured products accounted for 85 percent of total 2011 sales of Transportation Systems. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Asia and Latin America. Financial information including net sales and long-lived assets related to geographic areas is included in Note 24 of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Information regarding the economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international operations is included in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Raw Materials The principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available. Although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply, we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials and commodities in 2011. We are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials, except related to R240 (a key component in foam blowing agents), a raw material used in our Performance Materials and Technologies segment. The costs of certain key raw materials, including cumene, fluorspar, perchloroethylene, R240, natural gas, sulfur and ethylene in our Performance Materials and Technologies business, nickel, steel and other metals in our Transportation Systems business, and nickel, titanium and other metals in our Aerospace business, are expected to remain volatile. We will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2012. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion. Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. We own, or are licensed under, a large number of patents, patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years, which relate to many of our products or improvements to those products and which are of importance to our business. From time to time, new patents and trademarks are obtained, and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others. We also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and services produced by other companies. In our judgment, those rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any patent, trademark or related group of patents, or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product, to be of material importance in relation to our total business. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion. We have registered trademarks for a number of our products and services, including Honeywell, Aclar, Ademco, Bendix, BW, Callidus, Enovate, Esser, Fire-Lite, Garrett, Genetron, Gent, Howard Leight, Jurid, Matrikon, Maxon, MK, North, Notifier, Novar, RMG, Silent Knight, Spectra, System Sensor, Trend, Tridium and UOP. Research and Development Our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of new products, technologies and processes, and the development of new uses for existing products and software applications. The Companys principal research and development activities are in the U.S., India, Europe and China. Research and development (RD) expense totaled $1,799, $1,450 and $1,321 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009 , respectively. The increase in RD expense of 24 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 was mainly due to increased expenditures on the development of new technologies to support existing and new aircraft platforms in our Aerospace segment, the development of turbocharging systems for new diesel and gas applications in our Transportation Systems segment and new product development in our Automation and Control Solutions segment. The increase in RD expense of 10 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 was mainly due to additional product design and development costs in Automation and Control Solutions and increased expenditures on the development of products for new aircraft platforms. RD as a percentage of sales was 4.9, 4.5 and 4.4 percent in 2011, 2010 and 2009 , respectively. Customer-sponsored (principally the U.S. Government) RD activities amounted to an additional $867, $874 and $852 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009 , respectively. Environment We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. It is our policy to comply with these requirements, and we believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys Superfund priority list. Although, under some court interpretations of these laws, there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole. We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Companys business or markets that it serves, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. Further information, including the current status of significant environmental matters and the financial impact incurred for remediation of such environmental matters, if any, is included in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Employees We have approximately 132,000 employees at December 31, 2011, of which approximately 53,000 were located in the United States. ##TABLE_START ", "1A": " I tem 1A. Risk Factors ##TABLE_END Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements We have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including the overview of the Company and each of our segments and the discussion of their respective economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2012. These sections and other parts of this report (including this Item 1A) contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. Risk Factors Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the market and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations. The operating results of our segments are impacted by general global industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns, demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing and shipping costs. The operating results of our Aerospace segment, which generated 31 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2011, are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production, the deferral or cancellation of orders for new aircraft, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft platforms, the retirement of aircraft, global flying hours, and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates, as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts, supplier consolidation, factory transitions, capacity constraints, and the level and mix of U.S. Government appropriations for defense and space programs (as further discussed in other risk factors below). The challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including global flying hours, aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline consolidation, airline insolvencies, terrorism and safety concerns as well as changes in regulations. Future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our Aerospace aftermarket sales and margins. The operating results of our Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) segment, which generated 43 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2011, are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation, industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion, inventory levels in distribution channels, and global economic growth rates. Performance Materials and Technologies operating results, which generated 15 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2011, are impacted by global economic growth rates, capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, and raw material demand and supply volatility. Transportation Systems operating results, which generated 11 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2011, are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, and regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, delays in launch schedules for new automotive platforms, and consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products. Demand of global automotive and truck manufacturers will continue to be influenced by a wide variety of factors, including ability of consumers to obtain financing, ability to reduce operating costs and overall consumer and business confidence. Each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices (as further described below) and non-material inflation. Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers, and cause us to incur significant liabilities. The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in our Performance Materials and Technologies (cumene, fluorspar, perchloroethylene, R240, natural gas, sulfur and ethylene), Transportation Systems (nickel, steel and other metals) and Aerospace (nickel, titanium and other metals) segments. Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations. Our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials (including raw materials) by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components, and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions, quality standards, and applicable laws and regulations. In addition, many major components, product equipment items and raw materials are procured or subcontracted on a single-source basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies; in some circumstances these suppliers are the sole source of the component or equipment. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their non-performance. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by suppliers decisions to exit certain businesses, bankruptcy and by external events such as natural disasters, extreme weather events, pandemic health issues, terrorist actions, labor disputes, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes (e.g., product certification or stewardship requirements, sourcing restrictions, product authenticity, climate change or greenhouse gas emission standards, etc.). Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. Transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays, including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/or regulatory agencies. In addition, because our businesses cannot always immediately adapt their cost structure to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity for certain products may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements, which could adversely impact our operating costs, profitability and customer and supplier relationships. Our facilities, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to, among other things, fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, result in personal injury or property damage, damage relationships with our customers and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities or systems, as well as result in other liabilities and adverse impacts. The same risk can also arise from the failure of critical systems supplied by Honeywell to large industrial, refining and petrochemical customers. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins. Our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) develop and retain individuals with the requisite expertise. Our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources. These development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts. We own or are licensed under a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications, trademarks and copyrights. Our intellectual property rights may expire or be challenged, invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms. In some non-U.S. countries, laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application, which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights. Any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs, and/or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. Global cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. While we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations. Our international operations, including U.S. exports, comprise a growing proportion of our operating results. Our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets, including developing markets such as China, India, the Middle East and other high growth regions. In 2011, approximately 55 percent of our total sales (including products manufactured in the U.S. and sold outside the U.S. as well as products manufactured in international locations) were outside of the U.S. including approximately 30 percent in Europe and approximately 12 percent in Asia. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, government instability, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. We are also subject to U.S. laws prohibiting companies from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the type of business that may be conducted in these countries. The cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. Uncertain global economic conditions arising from circumstances such as sovereign debt issues and credit rating downgrades in certain European countries or speculation regarding changes to the composition or viability of the Euro zone could result in reduced customer confidence resulting in decreased demand for our products and services, disruption in payment patterns and higher default rates, a tightening of credit markets (see risk factor below regarding volatility of credit markets for further discussion), increased risk regarding supplier performance, increased counterparty risk with respect to the financial institutions with which we do business, and exchange rate fluctuations. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the financial institutions with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the US dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the US dollar and may adversely affect our results of operations. Currency fluctuations may affect product demand and prices we pay for materials, as a result, our operating margins may be negatively impacted. Fluctuations in exchange rates may give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of our non-U.S. businesses are translated into U.S. dollars. While we monitor our exchange rate exposures and seek to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities, such activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or successful in significantly mitigating such volatility. Volatility of credit markets or macro-economic factors could adversely affect our business. Changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate volatility, may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. A decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing. Delays in our customers ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing to our customers, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. The inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could result in the need to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant incremental cost and delay, as discussed above. Lastly, disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets could impact the financial institutions with which we do business. We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our long-lived assets or available for sale investments. At December 31, 2011, the net carrying value of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) and available for sale securities totaled approximately $19.1 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other long-lived assets. An other than temporary decline in the market value of our available for sale securities may also result in an impairment charge. Future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareowners equity and increase our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, which could negatively impact our credit rating and access to the public debt and equity markets. A change in the level of U.S. Government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact Aerospaces defense and space sales and results of operations. Sales of our defense and space-related products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets, particularly the U.S. defense budget. Sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. Department of Defense comprised approximately 29 and 9 percent of Aerospace and total sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2011. We cannot predict the extent to which total funding and/or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the 2012 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by Congress, or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations. We also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning and/or the nature of war-related activity on existing, follow-on or replacement programs. A shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate and/or reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations. As a supplier of military and other equipment to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unusual risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance. In addition to normal business risks, companies like Honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the U.S. Government are subject to unusual risks, including dependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds, changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments, significant changes in contract requirements, complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete, necessity for frequent design improvements, intense competition for U.S. Government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development, difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work, and other factors characteristic of the industry, such as contract award protests and delays in the timing of contract approvals. Changes are customary over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly development contracts, and generally result in adjustments to contract prices and schedules. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to various government audits. Like many other government contractors, we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts or changes to certain accounting systems or controls to comply with various government regulations. When appropriate and prudent, we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, plus termination costs and a reasonable profit. If a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for reprocurement costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and for other damages suffered by the government as permitted under the contract. We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. The U.S. Government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other egregious misconduct. Debarment generally does not exceed three years. Our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees, agents or business partners. We cannot ensure that our extensive compliance controls, policies and procedures will, in all instances, protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including laws governing payments to government officials, competition and data privacy. Any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, results of operations and reputation. Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations. Safety and performance regulations (including mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft), product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact Aerospace sales, research and development expenditures, operating costs and profitability. The demand for and cost of providing Automation and Control Solutions products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies results of operations can be affected by environmental (e.g. government regulation of fluorocarbons), safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations, while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our Transportation Systems segment. Legislation or regulations regarding areas such as labor and employment, employee benefit plans, tax, health, safety and environmental matters, import, export and trade, intellectual property, product certification, and product liability may impact the results of each of our operating segments and our consolidated results. Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned, and divestitures may not occur as planned. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, (ii) the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities, (iii) the failure to integrate acquired businesses into Honeywell on schedule and/or to achieve synergies in the planned amount or within the expected timeframe, (iv) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected timeframe, and (v) the degree of protection provided by indemnities from sellers of acquired companies and the obligations under indemnities provided to purchasers of our divested businesses. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, import and export matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings. Moreover, our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. It also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition. Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We have incurred remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We incur, and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our expenses include significant costs related to employee and retiree health benefits. With approximately 132,000 employees, including approximately 53,000 in the U.S., our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health benefits are significant. In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs, largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control, in particular, ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation. Continued increasing health-care costs, legislative or regulatory changes, and volatility in discount rates, as well as changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health benefit expenses, may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and pension contributions in future periods. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. Funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans may become more significant. However, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. For a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to estimate pension expense, including discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies included in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. In 2011, our tax expense represented 18.3 percent of our income before tax, and includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company that could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " I tem 1B.

Legal Proceedings ##TABLE_END We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial amounts) arising out of the conduct of our business. See a discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation matters in Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. Environmental Matters Involving Potential Monetary Sanctions in Excess of $100,000 Although the outcome of the matter discussed below cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that it will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows. The United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Department of Justice are investigating whether the Companys manufacturing facility in Hopewell, Virginia is in compliance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act and the facilitys air operating permit. Based on these investigations, the federal authorities have issued notices of violation with respect to the facilitys benzene waste operations, leak detection and repair program, emissions of nitrogen oxides and emissions of particulate matter. The Company has entered into negotiations with federal authorities to resolve the alleged violations.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities ##TABLE_END Market and dividend information for Honeywells common stock is included in Note 26 of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The number of record holders of our common stock at December 31, 2011 was 58,965. Honeywell purchased 1,450,000 shares of its common stock, par value $1 per share, in the quarter ending December 31, 2011. Honeywell purchased a total of 20,250,000 shares of its common stock in 2011. Under the Companys previously reported $3 billion share repurchase program, $1.9 billion remained available as of December 31, 2011 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time during 2012 to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including future option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating, financing and other investing activities. The following table summarizes Honeywells purchase of its common stock, par value $1 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2011: ##TABLE_START Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities    (a)  (b)  (c)   (d)  Period  Total Number of Shares Purchased  Average Price Paid per Share  Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs  Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet be Purchased Under Plans or Programs (Dollars in millions)        November 2011   1,250,000   $ 52.67   1,250,000   $ 1,925  December 2011   200,000   $ 50.09   200,000   $ 1,915  ##TABLE_END 22 Performance Graph The following graph compares the five-year cumulative total return on our Common Stock to the total returns on the Standard  Poors 500 Stock Index and a composite of Standard  Poors Industrial Conglomerates and Aerospace and Defense indices, on a 60%/40% weighted basis, respectively (the Composite Index). The weighting of the components of the Composite Index are based on our segments relative contribution to total segment profit. The selection of the Industrial Conglomerates component of the Composite Index reflects the diverse and distinct range of non-aerospace businesses conducted by Honeywell. The annual changes for the five-year period shown in the graph are based on the assumption that $100 had been invested in Honeywell stock and each index on December 31, 2006 and that all dividends were reinvested. ##TABLE_START   Dec 2006  Dec 2007  Dec 2008  Dec 2009  Dec 2010  Dec 2011        Honeywell    138.64   75.77   93.82   130.89   137.22   SP 500 Index     105.49   66.46   84.05   96.71   98.76   Composite Index    110.34   60.12   69.70   81.74   83.81   ##TABLE_END 23 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Gross margin percentage decreased by 1.8 percentage points in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to higher pension and other postretirement expense (approximate 2.8 percentage point impact primarily driven by an unfavorable 3.3 percentage point impact resulting from the increase in the pension mark-to-market adjustment allocated to cost of goods sold) and repositioning and other charges (approximate 0.2 percentage point impact), partially offset by higher sales volume driven by each of our business segments (approximate 1.2 percentage point impact). Cost of products and services sold increased by $1,461 million or 6 percent in 2010 compared with 2009, principally due to an estimated increase in direct material costs and indirect costs of approximately $1,250 million and $300 million, respectively, driven substantially by an 8 percent increase in sales as a result of the factors discussed above and in the Review of Business Segments section of this MDA and approximately $130 million increase in repositioning and other charges (see Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements), partially offset by a $300 million decrease in pension expense. Gross margin percentage increased by 1.3 percentage points in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to lower pension expense (approximate 1 percentage point impact) and higher sales volume driven by our Automation and Control Solutions segment, Performance Materials and Technologies segment and Transportation Systems segment (approximate 0.7 percentage point impact), partially offset by higher repositioning and other charges (approximate 0.5 percentage point impact).

Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) decreased as a percentage of sales by 0.1 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 driven by the impact of higher sales volume, discussed above, and lower pension expense, partially offset by an estimated $500 million increase in labor costs (reflecting the absence of prior period labor cost actions). ##TABLE_START Other (Income) Expense                          Equity (income)/loss of affiliated companies   $ (51 )   $ (28 )   $ (26 )  Gain on sale of non-strategic businesses and assets    (61 )         (87 )  Interest income    (58 )    (39 )    (33 )  Foreign exchange              Other, net        (42 )                   $ (84 )   $ (97 )   $ (54 )             ##TABLE_END Other income decreased by $13 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to a $29 million loss resulting from early redemption of debt in the first quarter of 2011, included within Other, net, and the absence of a $62 million pre-tax gain related to the consolidation of a joint venture within our Performance Materials and Technologies segment in the third quarter of 2010, included within Other, net, (see Note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements for further details), partially offset by a $61 million increase in gain on sale of non-strategic businesses and assets due primarily to a $50 million pre-tax gain related to the divestiture of the automotive on-board sensors products business within our Automation and Control Solutions segment and the reduction of approximately $12 million of acquisition related costs compared to 2010 included within Other, net. Other income increased by $43 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the consolidation of a joint venture resulting in a $62 million pre-tax gain within our Performance Materials and Technologies segment in the third quarter of 2010, included in Other, net (see Note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements for further details), the absence of an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $62 million in the second quarter of 2009, included within Other, net, partially offset by the absence of a $50 million deconsolidation gain related to a subsidiary within our Automation and Control Solutions segment in 2009, included within Gain on sale of non-strategic businesses and assets, and $22 million of acquisition related costs in 2010, included within Other, net. ##TABLE_START Interest and Other Financial Charges                         Interest and other financial charges   $    $    $   % change compared with prior period    (3 )%    (16 )%       ##TABLE_END  Interest and other financial charges decreased by 3% percent in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to lower borrowing costs, partially offset by higher debt balances. Interest and other financial charges decreased by 16% percent in 2010 compared with 2009 due to lower debt balances and lower borrowing costs.  Tax Expense ##TABLE_START         Tax expense   $    $    $   Effective tax rate    18.3 %    28.1 %    22.2 %  ##TABLE_END The effective tax rate decreased by 9.8 percentage points in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign related to higher U.S. pension expense (primarily driven by an approixmate 7.6 percentage point impact which resulted from the increase in pension mark-to-market expense), an increased benefit from manufacturing incentives, an increased benefit from the favorable settlement of tax audits and an increased benefit from a lower foreign effective tax rate. The foreign effective tax rate was 21.1 percent, a decrease of approximately 4.9 percentage points which primarily consisted of (i) a 5.1 percent impact from decreased valuation allowances on net operating losses primarily due to an increase in German earnings available to be offset by net operating loss carry forwards, (ii) a 2.4 percent impact from tax benefits related to foreign exchange and investment losses, iii) a 1.2 percent impact from an increased benefit in tax credits and lower statutory tax rates, and (iv) a 4.1 percent impact related to an increase in tax reserves. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign rates. The effective tax rate increased by 5.9 percentage points in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings related to lower U.S. pension expense, the impact of an enacted change in the tax treatment of the Medicare Part D program, the absence of manufacturing incentives, a decreased impact from the settlement of audits and an increase in the foreign effective tax rate. The foreign effective tax rate increased by approximately 7 percentage points which primarily consisted of i) a 6 percentage point impact from the absence of tax benefits related to foreign exchange and investment losses and ii) a (0.1) percentage points impact from increased valuation allowances on net operating losses. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign rates. In 2012, the effective tax rate could change based upon the Companys operating results, mix of earnings and the outcome of tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns currently under audit by various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities, several of which may be finalized in the foreseeable future. The Company believes that it has adequate reserves for these matters, the outcome of which could materially impact the results of operations and operating cash flows in the period they are resolved. ##TABLE_START Net Income Attributable to Honeywell                      Amounts attributable to Honeywell              Income from continuing operations  $ 1,858   $ 1,944   $ 1,492   Income from discontinued operations                    Net income attributable to Honeywell  $ 2,067   $ 2,022   $ 1,548                          Earnings per share of common stock  assuming dilution              Income from continuing operations  $ 2.35   $ 2.49   $ 1.98   Income from discontinued operations   0.26    0.10    0.07            Net income attributable to Honeywell  $ 2.61   $ 2.59   $ 2.05            ##TABLE_END Earnings per share of common stock  assuming dilution increased by $0.02 per share in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to an increase in segment profit in each of our business segments, lower tax expense, the gain on disposal of discontinued operations, and lower other postretirement expense, partially offset by higher pension expense (primarily due to an increase in the pension mark-to-market adjustment) and higher repositioning and other charges. Earnings per share of common stock  assuming dilution increased by $0.54 per share in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to increased segment profit in our Automation and Control Solutions, Performance Materials and Technologies and Transportation Systems segments and lower pension expense, partially offset by higher tax expense and higher repositioning and other charges.

The United States Government is a major customer for our defense and space products.  Economic and Other Factors Aerospace operating results are principally driven by: ##TABLE_START   New aircraft production rates and delivery schedules set by commercial air transport, regional jet, business and general aviation OE manufacturers, as well as airline profitability, platform mix and retirement of aircraft from service;      Global demand for commercial air travel as reflected in global flying hours and utilization rates for corporate and general aviation aircraft, as well as the demand for spare parts and maintenance and repair services for aircraft currently in use;      Level and mix of U.S. Government appropriations for defense and space programs and military activity;      Changes in customer platform development schedules, requirements and demands for new technologies; and      Availability and price volatility of raw materials such as titanium and other metals. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Aerospace                        Change   Change       Net sales  $ 11,475   $ 10,683   %  $ 10,763   (1 )%                      Cost of products and services sold   8,665    8,099       8,099      Selling, general and administrative expenses                 Other                          Segment profit  $ 2,023   $ 1,835   %  $ 1,893   (3 )%           ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   2011 vs. 2010  2010 vs. 2009     Factors Contributing to Year-Over-Year Change   Sales  Segment Profit  Sales  Segment Profit       Organic growth/ Operational segment profit  %  %  %  %  Acquisitions and divestitures, net  %  %  %  %  Other  %  %  (1 )%  (3 )%          Total % Change  %  %  (1 )%  (3 )%          ##TABLE_END Aerospace sales by major customer end-markets were as follows: ##TABLE_START    % of Aerospace Sales  % Change in Sales     Customer End-Markets     2011 Versus 2010  2010 Versus 2009        Commercial:                 Air transport and regional                 Original equipment  %  %  %  %  (2 )%  Aftermarket  %  %  %  %  %  Business and general aviation                 Original equipment  %  %  %  %  (27 )%  Aftermarket  %  %  %  %  %  Defense and Space  %  %  %  (2 )%  %            Total  %  %  %  %  (1 )%            ##TABLE_END  2011 compared with 2010 Aerospace sales increased by 7 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to an increase in organic growth of 7 percent primarily due to increased commercial sales volume. ##TABLE_START  Details regarding the changes in sales by customer end-markets are as follows:      Air transport and regional original equipment (OE) sales increased by 6 percent in 2011 primarily driven by higher sales to our OE customers, consistent with higher production rates, platform mix and a higher win rate on selectables (components selected by purchasers of new aircraft).      Air transport and regional aftermarket sales increased by 16 percent for 2011 primarily due to (i) increased maintenance activity and spare parts sales driven by an approximately 6 percent increase in global flying hours, (ii) increased sales of avionics upgrades, and (iii) changes in customer buying patterns relating to spare parts and maintenance activity.      Business and general aviation OE sales increased by 41 percent in 2011 due to a rebound from near trough levels in 2010 and strong demand in the business jet end market, favorable platform mix, growth from acquisitions and lower OEM Payments (as defined below) during 2011.      Business and general aviation aftermarket sales increased by 24 percent in 2011 primarily due to increased sales of spare parts and revenue associated with maintenance service agreements.      Defense and space sales decreased by 2 percent in 2011 primarily due to anticipated program ramp downs, partially offset by higher domestic and international aftermarket sales, increased unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) shipments and the EMS acquisition (refer to Note 2). ##TABLE_END Aerospace segment profit increased by 10 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to an increase in operational segment profit of 9 percent and an increase of 1 percent due to lower OEM Payments made during 2011. The increase in operational segment profit is comprised of the positive impact from higher commercial aftermarket demand, price and productivity, net of inflation, partially offset by research, development and engineering investments. Cost of goods sold totaled $8.7 billion in 2011, an increase of approximately $566 million from 2010 which is primarily a result of the factors discussed above. 2010 compared with 2009 Aerospace sales decreased by 1 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to a 1 percent reduction of revenue related to amounts recognized for payments to business and general aviation original equipment manufacturers to partially offset their pre-production costs associated with new aircraft platforms (OEM Payments). Details regarding the decrease in sales by customer end-markets are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Air transport and regional original equipment (OE) sales decreased by 2 percent in 2010 primarily due to lower sales to our air transport OE customers.      Air transport and regional aftermarket sales increased by 1 percent in 2010 primarily due to increased sales of spare parts driven by the impact of increased flying hours of approximately 6 percent in 2010.      Business and general aviation OE sales decreased by 27 percent in 2010 due to decreases in new business jet deliveries reflecting rescheduling and cancellations of deliveries by OE customers in the first six months and the impact of the OEM Payments discussed above.      Business and general aviation aftermarket sales increased by 8 percent in 2010 primarily due to increased sales of spare parts due to higher engine utilization, partially offset by lower revenue associated with licensing and maintenance service agreements.      Defense and space sales increased by 1 percent in 2010 primarily due to higher sales of logistics services partially offset by program wind-downs and completions and lower sales related to commercial helicopters. ##TABLE_END Aerospace segment profit decreased by 3 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a negative 3 percent impact from the OEM payments, discussed above. Operational segment profit was flat in 2010 with the approximate positive 4 percent impact from price and productivity, net of inflation (including the absence of prior period labor cost actions offset by the benefits from prior repositioning actions) offset by an approximate negative 4 percent impact from lower sales volume. Cost of goods sold totaled $8.1 billion in 2010, unchanged from 2009.  2012 Areas of Focus Aerospaces primary areas of focus for 2012 include: ##TABLE_START   Driving customer satisfaction through operational excellence (product quality, cycle time reduction, and supplier management);      Aligning research and development and customer support costs with customer requirements and demand for new platforms;      Expanding sales and operations in international locations;      Global pursuit of new defense and space programs;      Focusing on cost structure initiatives to maintain profitability in face of potential defense and space budget reductions and program specific appropriations;      Continuing to design equipment that enhances the safety, performance and durability of aerospace and defense equipment, while reducing weight and operating costs; and      Continued deployment and optimization of our common enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. ##TABLE_END Automation and Control Solutions (ACS)  Overview ACS provides innovative products and solutions that make homes, buildings, industrial sites and infrastructure more efficient, safe and comfortable.

Economic and Other Factors ACSs operating results are principally driven by: ##TABLE_START   Global commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades);      Demand for residential security and environmental control retrofits and upgrades;      Demand for energy efficient products and solutions;      Industrial production;      Government and public sector spending;      Economic conditions and growth rates in developed (U.S. and Europe) and emerging markets;      The strength of global capital and operating spending on process (including petrochemical and refining) and building automation;      Inventory levels in distribution channels; and      Changes to energy, fire, security, health care, safety and environmental concerns and regulations. ##TABLE_END 35 ##TABLE_START Automation and Control Solutions                        Change   Change       Net sales  $ 15,535   $ 13,749   %  $ 12,611   %                      Cost of products and services sold   10,448    9,312       8,561      Selling, general and administrative expenses   2,819    2,480       2,256      Other                          Segment profit  $ 2,083   $ 1,770   %  $ 1,588   %           ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   2011 vs. 2010  2010 vs. 2009     Factors Contributing to Year-Over-Year Change  Sales  Segment Profit  Sales  Segment Profit       Organic growth/ Operational segment profit  %  %  %  %  Foreign exchange  %  %  %  %  Acquisitions and divestitures, net  %  %  %  %          Total % Change  %  %  %  %          ##TABLE_END  2011 compared with 2010 Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) sales increased by 13 percent in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to a 6 percent growth from acquisitions, net of divestitures, 5 percent increase in organic revenue driven by increased sales volume and higher prices and 2 percent favorable impact of foreign exchange through the first nine months partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange in the fourth quarter. We expect sales growth to continue to moderate in the first quarter of 2012 due to European economic conditions and the anticipated negative impact of foreign exchange. ##TABLE_START   Sales in our Energy, Safety  Security businesses increased by 17 percent (6 percent organically) in 2011 principally due to (i) the positive impact of acquisitions (most significantly Sperian and EMS), net of divestitures (ii) higher sales volume due to general industrial recovery and new product introductions and (iii) the favorable impact of foreign exchange.      Sales in our Process Solutions increased 12 percent (6 percent organically) in 2011 principally due to (i) increased volume reflecting conversion to sales from backlog (ii) the favorable impact of foreign exchange and (iii) the impact of acquisitions. Orders increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily driven by continued favorable macro trends in oil and gas infrastructure projects, growth in emerging regions and the positive impact of foreign exchange.      Sales in our Building Solutions  Distribution increased by 6 percent (4 percent organically) in 2011 driven principally due to (i) volume growth in our Building Solutions business reflecting conversion to sales from order backlog and increased sales volume in our Distribution business (ii) the favorable impact of foreign exchange and (iii) the impact of acquisitions, net of divestitures. ##TABLE_END ACS segment profit increased by 18 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 due to a 9 percent increase in operational segment profit, 6 percent increase from acquisitions, net of divestitures and 3 percent positive impact of foreign exchange. The increase in operational segment profit is comprised of an approximate 5 percent positive impact from price and productivity, net of inflation and investment for growth and a 4 percent positive impact from higher sales volumes. Cost of goods sold totaled $10.4 billion in 2011, an increase of approximately $1.1 billion which is primarily due to acquisitions, net of divestitures, higher sales volume, foreign exchange and inflation partially offset by positive impact from productivity.  2010 compared with 2009 ACS sales increased by 9 percent in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to a 6 percent increase in organic revenue driven by increased sales volume and 3 percent growth from acquisitions. ##TABLE_START   Sales in our Energy, Safety  Security businesses increased by 14 percent in 2010 primarily reflecting higher sales volumes in our businesses tied to industrial production (environmental and combustion controls, sensing and control, gas detection, personal protective equipment and scanning and mobility products), new product introductions and acquisitions, primarily Sperian.      Sales in Process Solutions increased 7 percent in 2010 primarily due to the positive impact of increased volume, acquisitions (primarily the RMG Group), higher prices and industrial field solutions driven by order growth and conversion to sales from order backlog.      Sales in Building Solutions  Distribution increased by 3 percent in 2010 driven primarily by energy efficiency projects and conversion to sales from order backlog. ##TABLE_END ACS segment profit increased by 11 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 due to a 9 percent increase in operational segment profit and 2 percent increase from acquisitions. The increase in operational segment profit is comprised of an approximate 18 percent positive impact from higher sales volume, partially offset by an approximate 9 percent negative impact from inflation, net of price and productivity (including the absence of prior period labor cost actions, partially offset by the benefits of prior repositioning). Cost of goods sold totaled $9.3 billion in 2010, an increase of approximately $750 million which is primarily as a result of the factors discussed above.  2012 Areas of Focus ACSs primary areas of focus for 2012 include: ##TABLE_START   Products and solutions for energy efficiency and asset management;      Extending technology leadership: lowest total installed cost and integrated product solutions;      Defending and extending our installed base through customer productivity and globalization;      Sustaining strong brand recognition through our brand and channel management;      Continued centralization and standardization of global software development capabilities;      Continuing to identify, execute and integrate acquisitions in or adjacent to the markets which we serve;      Continuing to establish and grow emerging markets presence and capability;      Continuing to invest in new product development and introductions;      Continued deployment and optimization of our common ERP system; and      Increased focus on commercial and RD effectiveness. ##TABLE_END Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT)  Overview During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Specialty Materials segment was renamed to Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT). PMT better reflects the businesses expanded set of technology and product offerings that reach far beyond the traditional scope associated with specialty materials. Performance Materials and Technologies develops and manufactures high-purity, high-quality and high-performance chemicals and materials for applications in the refining, petrochemical, automotive, healthcare, agricultural, packaging, refrigeration, appliance, housing, semiconductor, wax and adhesives segments. Performance Materials and Technologies also provides process technology, products and services for the petroleum refining, gas processing, petrochemical, renewable energy and other industries. Performance Materials and Technologies product portfolio includes fluorocarbons, hydrofluoroolefins, caprolactam, resins, ammonium sulfate for fertilizer, phenol, specialty films, waxes, additives, advanced fibers, customized research chemicals and intermediates, electronic materials and chemicals, catalysts, and adsorbents. ##TABLE_START  Economic and Other Factors     Performance Materials and Technologies operating results are principally driven by:      Level and timing of capital spending and capacity and utilization rates in refining and petrochemical end markets;      Pricing volatility and industry supply conditions for raw materials such as cumene, fluorspar, perchloroethylene, R240, natural gas, sulfur and ethylene;      Impact of environmental and energy efficiency regulations;      Extent of change in order rates from global semiconductor customers;      Global demand for non-ozone depleting Hydro fluorocarbons (HFCs);      Condition of the U.S. residential housing and non residential industries and automotive demand;      Global demand for caprolactam and ammonium sulfate; and      Demand for new products including renewable energy and biofuels. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Performance Materials and Technologies                                      Change   Change       Net sales  $ 5,659  $ 4,726  %  $ 4,144  %   Cost of products and services sold   4,151   3,554      3,127     Selling, general and administrative expenses              Other                    Segment profit  $ 1,042  $  %  $  %        ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   2011 vs. 2010  2010 vs. 2009     Factors Contributing to Year-Over-Year Change  Sales  Segment Profit  Sales  Segment Profit       Organic growth/ Operational segment profit    %    %    %    %  Foreign exchange    %    %    %    (1 )%  Acquisitions and divestitures, net    %    %    %    %              Total % Change    %    %    %    %              ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   2011 compared with 2010   PMT sales increased by 20 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 due to a 16 percent increase in organic growth, 3 percent growth from acquisitions, and a 1 percent favorable impact of foreign exchange.    Advanced Materials sales increased by 18 percent (12 percent organically) in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily driven by (i) a 33 percent (18 percent organically) increase in Resins and Chemicals sales primarily due to higher prices driven by strong Asia demand, agricultural demand, formula pricing arrangements and increased sales resulting from the acquisition of a phenol plant, partially offset by decreased volumes primarily due to disruptions in phenol supply and weather related events, (ii) a 10 percent increase in our Fluorine Products business due to higher pricing reflecting robust global demand and tight industry supply conditions primarily in the first half of the year, which moderated in the second half of the year due to seasonally weaker demand and increased available capacity in the marketplace, (iii) a 12 percent increase in Specialty Products sales primarily due to higher sales volume in our armor, additives, and healthcare packaging products, and commercial excellence initiatives. We expect Advanced Materials sales growth to continue to moderate during the first half of 2012 due to slowing global demand and lower prices resulting from increased availability of refrigerants supply. ##TABLE_END 38 ##TABLE_START  UOP sales increased by 24 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily driven by increased service, and licensing revenues and higher unit sales of refining and specialty catalysts, primarily reflecting continued strength in the refining and petrochemical industries.    PMT segment profit increased by 39 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 due to a 38 percent increase in operational segment profit and a 1 percent favorable impact of foreign exchange. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily due to the favorable price to raw materials spread in Resins and Chemicals and Fluorine Products and higher service, product and licensing revenues in UOP, partially offset by continued investment in growth and plant optimization initiatives. Cost of goods sold totaled $4.2 billion in 2011, an increase of approximately $597 million which is primarily due to volume, material inflation, the phenol plant acquisition and continued investment in growth initiatives.   2010 compared with 2009    PMT sales increased by 14 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 predominantly due to organic growth.    Advanced Materials sales increased by 23 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily driven by (i) a 29 percent increase in Resins and Chemicals sales primarily due to higher prices driven by strong Asia demand, formula pricing arrangements and agricultural demand, (ii) a 21 percent increase in Specialty Products sales most significantly due to higher sales volume to our semiconductor, specialty additives, advanced fiber industrial applications and specialty chemicals customers, (iii) a 19 percent increase in our Fluorine Products business due to higher sales volume from increased demand for our refrigerants, insulating materials and industrial processing aids.     UOP sales decreased by 1 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily driven by lower new unit catalyst sales and timing of projects activity in the refining and petrochemical industries, partially offset by increased gas processing equipment sales.    PMT segment profit increased by 24 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 due to a 25 percent increase in operational segment profit. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily due to a 24 percent positive impact from higher sales volumes. The positive impact from price and productivity was offset by the negative impact from inflation (including the absence of prior period labor cost actions). Cost of goods sold totaled $3.6 billion in 2010, an increase of approximately $400 million which is primarily as a result of the factors discussed above.     2012 Areas of Focus     Performance Materials and Technologies primary areas of focus for 2012 include:      Continuing to develop new processes, products and technologies that address energy efficiency, the environment and security, as well as position the portfolio for higher value;      Commercializing new products and technologies in the petrochemical, gas processing and refining industries and renewable energy sector;      Investing to increase plant capacity and reliability and improving productivity and quality through operational excellence;      Driving sales and marketing excellence and expanding local presence in fast growing emerging markets; and      Managing exposure to raw material price and supply fluctuations through evaluation of alternative sources of supply and contractual arrangements. ##TABLE_END 39 ##TABLE_START Transportation Systems     Overview    Transportation Systems provides automotive products that improve the performance and efficiency of cars, trucks, and other vehicles through state-of-the-art technologies, world class brands and global solutions to customers needs. Transportation Systems products include turbochargers and thermal systems; and friction materials (Bendix(R) and Jurid(R)) and brake hard parts. Transportation Systems sells its products to original equipment (OE) automotive and truck manufacturers (e.g., BMW, Caterpillar, Daimler, Renault, Ford, and Volkswagen), wholesalers and distributors and through the retail aftermarket.     Economic and Other Factors     Transportation Systems operating results are principally driven by:      Financial strength and stability of automotive OE manufacturers;      Global demand, particularly in Western Europe, for automobile and truck production;      Turbo penetration rates for new engine platforms;      Global consumer preferences, particularly in Western Europe, for boosted diesel passenger cars;      Degree of volatility in raw material prices, including nickel and steel;      New automobile production rates and the impact of inventory levels of automotive OE manufacturers on demand for our products;      Regulations mandating lower emissions and improved fuel economy;      Consumers ability to obtain financing for new vehicle purchases; and      Impact of factors such as consumer confidence on automotive aftermarket demand. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Transportation systems                            Change   Change       Net sales  $ 3,859  $ 3,192  %  $ 2,432  %   Cost of products and services sold   3,174   2,641      2,190     Selling, general and administrative expenses              Other                     Segment profit  $  $  %  $  %        ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   2011 vs. 2010  2010 vs. 2009    Factors Contributing to Year-Over-Year Change  Sales  Segment Profit  Sales  Segment Profit                     Organic growth/ Operational segment profit  %  %  %  %  Foreign exchange  %  %  (2 )%  (11 )%          Total % Change  %  %  %  %          ##TABLE_END 2011 compared with 2010 Transportation Systems sales increased by 21 percent in 2011 compared with the 2010 primarily due to a 16 percent increase in organic revenue driven by increased sales volume and a favorable impact of foreign exchange of 5 percent. The sales increase in 2011 as compared with 2010 was primarily driven by (i) increased turbocharger sales to both light vehicle and commercial vehicle engine manufacturers primarily due to new platform launches and strong diesel penetration rates in Western Europe and (ii) the favorable impact of foreign exchange. We expect turbocharger year over year sales growth rate to moderate in the first quarter of 2012 primarily due to reduced European light vehicle production and the anticipated negative impact of foreign exchange. Transportation Systems segment profit increased by 37 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 due to a 32 percent increase in operational segment profit and a 5 percent favorable impact of foreign exchange. The increase in operational segment profit is comprised of an approximate 25 percent positive impact from productivity, net of inflation and price, and 7 percent positive impact from higher sales volumes. Cost of goods sold totaled $3.2 billion in 2011, an increase of $533 million which is primarily a result of higher sales volume, foreign exchange and inflation, partially offset by positive impact from productivity.  2010 compared with 2009 Transportation Systems sales increased by 31 percent in 2010 compared with the 2009, primarily due to a 33 percent increase in organic revenue driven by increased sales volume, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 2 percent. The sales increase in 2010 as compared with 2009 was primarily due to increased turbocharger sales to both light vehicle and commercial vehicle engine manufacturers partially offset by the negative impacts of foreign exchange. Transportation Systems segment profit increased by $292 million in 2010 compared with 2009 predominantly due to the positive impact from increased sales volume. Cost of goods sold totaled $2.6 billion in 2010, an increase of approximately $450 million which is also primarily a result of increased sales volume. ##TABLE_START  2012 Areas of Focus    Transportation Systems primary areas of focus in 2012 include:     Sustaining superior turbocharger technology through successful platform launches;      Maintaining the high quality of current products while executing new product introductions;      Increasing global penetration and share of diesel and gasoline turbocharger OEM demand;      Addressing capacity challenges and improving cost structure through increasing plant productivity and expansion of global manufacturing footprint;      Aligning cost structure with current economic outlook, and successful execution of repositioning actions; and      Aligning development efforts and costs with new turbo platform launch schedules. ##TABLE_END Repositioning and Other Charges See Note 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of repositioning and other charges incurred in 2011, 2010, and 2009. Our repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of approximately $150 million in 2012 compared with 2011 principally from planned workforce reductions. Cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute our repositioning actions were $159, $147, and $193 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Such expenditures for severance and other exit costs have been funded principally through operating cash flows. Cash expenditures for severance and other costs necessary to execute the remaining actions are expected to be approximately $150 million in 2012 and will be funded through operating cash flows. The following tables provide details of the pretax impact of total net repositioning and other charges by segment. ##TABLE_START   Years Ended December 31,         Aerospace          Net repositioning charge  $    $    $                                 Years Ended December 31,         Automation and Control Solutions          Net repositioning charge  $    $    $                                 Years Ended December 31,         Performance Materials and Technologies          Net repositioning charge  $    $    $                                 Years Ended December 31,         Transportation Systems          Net repositioning charge  $    $    $   Asbestos related litigation charges, net of insurance                           $    $    $                                 Years Ended December 31,         Corporate          Net repositioning charge  $    $     $    Asbestos related litigation charges, net of insurance             Probable and reasonably estimable environmental liabilities             Other                            $    $    $               ##TABLE_END LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets, as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables. We continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. Cash Flow Summary Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended 2011, 2010 and 2009, are summarized as follows: ##TABLE_START        Cash provided by (used for):          Operating activities  $  2,833   $  4,203   $  3,946  Investing activities    (611 )    (2,269 )    (1,133 ) Financing activities    (1,114 )    (2,047 )    (2,152 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash    (60 )    (38 )                 Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents  $  1,048   $  (151 )  $               ##TABLE_END 2011 compared with 2010 Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1,370 million during 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to i) increased voluntary cash contributions of $1,050 million to our U.S. pension plans, ii) an unfavorable impact from decreased deferred taxes (excluding the impact of cash taxes) of approximately $710 million, and iii) higher cash tax payments of approximately $500 million, partially offset by an $863 million increase of net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment. Cash used for investing activities decreased by $1,658 million during 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to an increase in proceeds from sale of businesses of $1,149 million (most significantly the divestiture of the Consumer Products Group business and the automotive on-board sensor products business within our Automation and Control Solutions segment), a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $330 million, and a net $315 million decrease in investments of short-term marketable securities. Cash used for financing activities decreased by $933 million during 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in the net proceeds from debt of $1,734 million and a decrease of $293 million in the payment of debt assumed with acquisitions, partially offset by an increase of $1,085 million of repurchases of common stock. 2010 compared with 2009 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $257 million during 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to i) increased accrued expenses of $690 million (due to increased customer advances and incentive compensation accruals), ii) a $550 million impact from increased deferred taxes (excluding the impact of cash taxes), iii) increased net income of $474 million, iv) lower cash tax payments of approximately $300 million and v) a $219 million decrease in payments for repositioning and other charges, partially offset by a i) $1,059 unfavorable impact from working capital driven by higher receivables and increased purchases of raw materials and component inventory to support higher demand, partially offset by a corresponding increase to accounts payable, ii) increased pension and other postretirement payments of $598 million and iii) the absence of $155 million sale of long-term receivables in 2009. Cash used for investing activities increased by $1,136 million during 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $835 million (most significantly Sperian Protection), and a net $341 million increase in investments in short-term marketable securities Cash used for financing activities decreased by $105 million during 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to a decrease in the net repayment of debt (including commercial paper) of $287 million and an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock, primarily related to stock option exercises of $158 million, partially offset by the repayment of $326 million of debt assumed in the acquisition of Sperian Protection. Liquidity Each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. Considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies, including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, the Company believes that cash balances and operating cash flows are the principal source of liquidity. In addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets, as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables. At December 31, 2011, a substantial portion of the Companys cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. If the amounts held outside of the U.S. were to be repatriated, under current law, they would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability. A source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing potential acquisitions. There was $599 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011. Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2011, Standard and Poors (SP), Fitch, and Moodys have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 respectively, and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1 respectively. SP, Fitch and Moodys have Honeywells rating outlook as stable. To date, the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity. We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions. As a source of liquidity, we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, none of the receivables in the designated pools had been sold to third parties. When we sell receivables, they are over-collateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that over-collateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools. The terms of the trade accounts receivable program permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion, providing us with an additional source of revolving credit. As a result, program receivables remain on the Companys balance sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as either Short-term borrowings or Long-term debt. In February 2011, the Company issued $800 million 4.25% Senior Notes due 2021 and $600 million 5.375% Senior Notes due 2041 (collectively, the Notes). The Notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywells existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of Honeywells subordinated debt. The offering resulted in gross proceeds of $1,400 million, offset by $19 million in discount and closing costs related to the offering. In the first quarter of 2011, the Company repurchased the entire outstanding principal amount of its $400 million 5.625% Notes due 2012 via a cash tender offer and a subsequent optional redemption. The costs relating to the early redemption of the Notes, including the make-whole premium, was $29 million. In March 2011, the Company entered into a $2,800 million Five Year Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks. Commitments under the Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $3,500 million. The Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes, including support for the issuance of commercial paper, and replaces the previous $2,800 million five year credit agreement dated May 14, 2007 (Prior Agreement). At December 31, 2011, there were no borrowings or letters of credit issued under the credit facility. The credit facility does not restrict Honeywells ability to pay dividends, nor does it contain financial covenants. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company repaid $500 million of its 6.125% notes at maturity. The repayment was funded with cash provided by operating activities. We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Global economic conditions or a tightening of credit markets could adversely affect our customers or suppliers ability to obtain financing, particularly in our long-cycle businesses and airline and automotive end markets. Customer or supplier bankruptcies, delays in their ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing could adversely affect our cash flow or results of operations. To date we have not experienced material impacts from customer or supplier bankruptcy or liquidity issues. We continue to monitor and take measures to limit our exposure. In February 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $3 billion of Honeywell common stock. During 2011, the Company repurchased $1,085 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including future option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans (see Part II, Item 5 for share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2011). In July 2011, the Company sold its Consumer Products Group business (CPG) to Rank Group Limited. The sale was completed for approximately $955 million in cash proceeds, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $301 million and a pproximately $178 million net of tax. The gain was recorded in net income from discontinued operations after taxes in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. The net income attributable to the non-controlling interest for the discontinued operations is insignificant. The sale of CPG, which had been part of the Transportation Systems segment, is consistent with the Companys strategic focus on its portfolio of differentiated global technologies. See Acquisitions and Divestitures in Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion. In August 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of EMS, a leading provider of connectivity solutions for mobile networking, rugged mobile computers and satellite communications. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was approximately $513 million. See Acquisitions and Divestitures in Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion. In December 2011, the Company acquired Kings Safetywear Limited (KSW), a leading international provider of branded safety footwear. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was approximately $331 million (including the assumption of debt of $33 million). See Acquisitions and Divestitures in Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion. During 2011, the Company made voluntary cash contributions to its U.S. pension plans of $1,650 million to improve the funded status of our plans. In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions, share repurchases and any strategic acquisitions. Specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2012 to be as follows: ##TABLE_START   Capital expenditureswe expect to spend approximately $1.1 billion for capital expenditures in 2012 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement.      Share repurchases Under the Companys previously reported $3 billion share repurchase program, $1.9 billion remained available as of December 31, 2011 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time during 2012 to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including future option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating, financing and other investing activities.      Dividendswe expect to pay approximately $1.2 billion in dividends on our common stock in 2012, reflecting the 12 percent increase in the dividend rate effective with the fourth quarter 2011 dividend.      Asbestos claimswe expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $240 and $75 million, respectively, in 2012. See Asbestos Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for further discussion of possible funding obligations in 2012 related to the Narco Trust.      Pension contributionsIn 2012, we plan to make cash contributions of $800 million to $1 billion ($250 million was made in January 2012) to our plans to improve the funded status of the plans. These contributions principally consist of voluntary contributions to our U.S. plans. The timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans.      Repositioning actionswe expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the previously announced repositioning actions will approximate $150 million in 2012. ##TABLE_END 45 ##TABLE_START   Environmental remediation costswe expect to spend approximately $300 million in 2012 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs. See Environmental Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for additional information. ##TABLE_END We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2011 we realized $1,156 million in cash proceeds from sales of non-strategic businesses. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines, access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. Contractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments Following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2011: ##TABLE_START     Payments by Period      Total(6)   2013- 2014  2015- 2016  Thereafter      Long-term debt, including capitalized                leases (1)  $  6,896   $    $  1,241   $    $  5,184  Interest payments on long-term debt, including capitalized leases    2,836                 1,801  Minimum operating lease payments    1,213                  Purchase obligations (2)    1,566     1,086              Estimated environmental liability                          payments (3)                     Asbestos related liability payments (4)    1,736                  Asbestos insurance recoveries (5)                                           $  15,750   $  2,278   $  3,682   $  1,854   $  7,936                      ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity.   (2) Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements.   (3) The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2011. See Environmental Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for additional information.   (4) These amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2011. Except for amounts due upon the effective date of the NARCO Plan of Reorganization ($76 million), we have assumed funding for the NARCO Trust will occur in 2013 and beyond. Projecting the timing of NARCO payments is dependent on, among other things, the effective date of the Trust which could cause the timing of payments to be earlier or later than that projected. Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause asbestos liabilities to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. See Asbestos Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for additional information.   (5) These amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos related liabilities as of December 31, 2011. The timing of insurance recoveries are impacted by the terms of insurance settlement agreements, as well as the documentation, review and collection process required to collect on ##TABLE_END 46 ##TABLE_START  insurance claims. Where probable insurance recoveries are not subject to definitive settlement agreements with specified payment dates, but instead are covered by insurance policies, we have assumed collection will occur beyond 2016. Projecting the timing of insurance recoveries is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the amounts collected to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded or could cause the timing of collections to be earlier or later than that projected. We reevaluate our projections concerning insurance recoveries in light of any changes or developments that would impact recoveries or the timing thereof. See Asbestos Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for additional information.   (6) The table excludes $815 million of uncertain tax positions. See Note 6 to the financial statements. ##TABLE_END The table also excludes our pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) obligations. In 2012, we plan to make cash contributions of $800 million to $1 billion ($250 million was made in January 2012) to our plans to improve the funded status of the plans. These contributions principally consist of voluntary contributions to our U.S. plans. The timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans. Beyond 2012, the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations. Payments due under our OPEB plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans. We expect our OPEB payments to approximate $167 million in 2012 net of the benefit of approximately $13 million from the Medicare prescription subsidy. See Note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of our pension and OPEB plans. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Following is a summary of our off-balance sheet arrangements:  Guarantees We have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at December 31, 2011: ##TABLE_START   Maximum Potential Future Payments  Operating lease residual values  $   Other third parties financing     Unconsolidated affiliates financing     Customer financing           $       ##TABLE_END We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination, if any, existing on the date of disposition. Such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually o r jointly, with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters. It is our policy (see Note 1 to the financial statements) to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. Remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were $240, $225 and $151 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the recorded liabilities for environmental matters was $723 and $753 million, respectively. In addition, in 2011 and 2010 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $102 and $86 million, respectively, relating to compliance with environmental regulations. Remedial response and voluntary cleanup payments were $270, $266 and $318 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are currently estimated to be approximately $300 million in 2012. We expect to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow. Although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. See Note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies, including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation. Financial Instruments As a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. A summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in Note 1 to the financial statements. We also hold investments in marketable equity securities, which exposes us to market volatility, as discussed in Note 16 to the financial statements. We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade. Our objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency cash flows. We attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties. Our principal currency exposures relate to the U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Mexican peso, Swiss franc, Czech koruna, Chinese renminbi, Indian rupee, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Korean won and Thai baht. Our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our net debt and pension obligations. As described in Notes 14 and 16 to the financial statements, we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs. Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and expected future cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. The following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one-percentage-point increase in interest rates across all maturities, the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities, and the potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent decrease in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities at December 31, 2011 and 2010. ##TABLE_START   Face or Notional Amount  Carrying Value (1)  Fair Value (1)  Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value           December 31, 2011                  Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments                  Long-term debt (including current maturities)  $ 6,896   $ (6,896 )  $ (7,896 )  $ (578 )  Interest rate swap agreements   1,400          (74 )  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments                  Foreign currency exchange contracts (2)   7,108    (26 )   (26 )     Commodity Price Sensitive Instruments                  Forward commodity contracts (3)      (9 )   (9 )   (10 )                    December 31, 2010                  Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments                  Long-term debt (including current maturities)  $ 6,278   $ (6,278 )  $ (6,835 )  $ (399 )  Interest rate swap agreements            (18 )  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments                  Foreign currency exchange contracts (2)   5,733            Commodity Price Sensitive Instruments                  Forward commodity contracts (3)              (4 )  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Asset or (liability).   (2) Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions.   (3) Changes in the fair value of forward commodity contracts are offset by changes in the cash flows of underlying hedged commodity transactions. ##TABLE_END The above discussion of our procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from our sensitivity analyses are forward-looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. The methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and our Independent Registered Public Accountants. New accounting standards effective in 2011 which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements are described in the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section in Note 1 to the financial statements.  Contingent Liabilities We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. For a discussion of our contingencies related to environmental, asbestos and other matters, including managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities, see Notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements.  Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries We are a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos (refractory and friction products). We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO trust through 2018 as described in Note 21 to the financial statements. In light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims since January 2002, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. We will continue to update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future Bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year. For additional information see Note 21 to the financial statements. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers, our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers, various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers. Our insurance is with both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. See Note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities.  Defined Benefit Pension Plans  We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. We recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment). Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change as they may each year. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets. This accounting method also results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM adjustments. MTM adjustments were $1,802, $471 and $741 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The remaining components of pension expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded on a quarterly basis (On-going Pension Expense). For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations on future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 22 to the financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. Further information on all our major actuarial assumptions is included in Note 22 to the financial statements. The key assumptions used in developing our 2011, 2010 and 2009 net periodic pension expense for our U.S. plans included the following: ##TABLE_START            Discount rate   5.25 %   5.75 %   6.95 %  Assets:              Expected rate of return   %   %   %  Actual rate of return   %   %   %  Actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return   %   %   %  ##TABLE_END The discount rate can be volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We will use a 4.89 percent discount rate in 2012, reflecting the decrease in the market interest rate environment since December 31, 2010. We plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 8 percent for 2012 as this is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations on future market conditions and the asset mix of the plans investments. In addition to the potential for MTM adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future on-going pension expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and on-going expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM adjustment: ##TABLE_START Change in Assumption  Impact on 2012 On-Going Pension Expense  Impact on PBO     0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate  Decrease $10 million   Increase $410 million   0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate  Increase $8 million   Decrease $400 million   0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets  Increase $32 million      0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets  Decrease $32 million      ##TABLE_END On-going pension expense for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately $60 million in 2012, a decrease of $45 million from 2011, due primarily to the impact of planned cash contributions in 2012. Also, if required, an MTM adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM adjustment in 2012, and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our U.S. pension plans. However, we made voluntary contributions of $1,650, $1,000 and $740 million to our U.S. pension plans in 2011, 2010 and 2009 , respectively, primarily to improve the funded status of our plans which has been adversely impacted by relatively low discount rates and asset losses in 2011 and 2008 resulting from the poor performance of the equity markets. In 2012, we plan to make cash contributions of $800 million to $1 billion ($250 million was made in January 2012) to our plans to improve the funded status of the plans. These contributions principally consist of voluntary contributions to our U.S. plans. The timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans.  Long-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets) To conduct our global business operations and execute our business strategy, we acquire tangible and intangible assets, including property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets. At December 31, 2011, the net carrying amount of these long-lived assets totaled approximately $6.5 billion. The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not these assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review are as follows: ##TABLE_START   significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations;      annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line;      significant negative industry or economic trends; and      significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. ##TABLE_END Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 in the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates, our assumptions as to volume, selling prices and costs, and the discount rate selected. As described in more detail in Note 16 to the financial statements, we have recorded impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $127 million and $30 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment in facilities scheduled to close or be downsized. Goodwill Impairment Testing Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing. Our Goodwill balance, $11.9 billion as of December 31, 2011, is subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value is reduced to fair value. The fair value of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. This impairment test involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions. We completed our annual impairment test as of March 31, 2011 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. However, significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances, including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions. As of December 31, 2011, we recognized a net deferred tax asset of $2,421 million, less a valuation allowance of $591 million. Net deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of net deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods. The determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. The projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs. Additionally, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws. Our net deferred tax asset of $2,421 million consists of $1,516 million related to U.S. operations and $905 million related to non-U.S. operations. The U.S. net deferred tax asset of $1,516 million consists of net deductible temporary differences, tax credit carryforwards, federal and state tax net operating losses which we believe will more likely than not be realized through the generation of future taxable income in the U.S. and tax planning strategies. We maintain a valuation allowance of $5 million against such asset related to state net operating losses. The non-U.S. net deferred tax asset of $905 million consists principally of net operating and capital loss carryforwards, mainly in France, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany. We maintain a valuation allowance of $588 million against these deferred tax assets reflecting our historical experience and lower expectations of taxable income over the applicable carryforward periods. As more fully described in Note 6 to the financial statements, our valuation allowance decreased by $45 million in 2011 and increased by $58 million and $133 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income in the period that such determination is made. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance and this guidance determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Sales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts In 2011, we recognized approximately 16 percent of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts in our Automation and Control Solutions, Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies segments. These long-term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.

N ote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting Principles The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is a description of Honeywells significant accounting policies..  Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. Our consolidation policy requires equity investments that we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investees activities to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. The Consumer Products Group (CPG) automotive aftermarket business had historically been part of the Transportation Systems reportable segment. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, CPG is presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures for further details.  Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit and highly liquid, temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less.  Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out or the average cost method and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for certain qualifying domestic inventories.  Investments Investments in affiliates over which we have a significant influence, but not a controlling interest, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Other investments are carried at market value, if readily determinable, or at cost. All equity investments are periodically reviewed to determine if declines in fair value below cost basis are other-than-temporary. Significant and sustained decreases in quoted market prices or a series of historic and projected operating losses by investees are strong indicators of other-than-temporary declines. If the decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment loss is recorded and the investment is written down to a new carrying value.  Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding assets useful life. See Note 11 and Note 17 for additional details.  Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2011 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. See Note 12 for additional details on goodwill balances.  Other Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years.  Long-Lived Assets We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with determinable lives) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate events or changes in circumstances based on a number of factors including operating results, business plans and forecasts, general and industry trends and, economic projections and anticipated cash flows. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in earnings. We also continually evaluate the estimated useful lives of all long-lived assets and periodically revise such estimates based on current events.  Sales Recognition Product and service sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities in our Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments, are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts in the Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments are recorded on a percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident. Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis. Amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses as a result of customers inability to make required payments. We estimate anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on days past due, as measured from the contractual due date, historical collection history and incorporate changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in historical trends for example, customers in bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization. Receivables are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are determined uncollectible. Such determination includes analysis and consideration of the particular conditions of the account, including time intervals since last collection, success of outside collection agencies activity, solvency of customer and any bankruptcy proceedings.  Environmental Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and that do not provide future benefits, are expensed as incurred. Liabilities are recorded when environmental remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities.  Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries Honeywell is a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos (refractory and friction products). We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust through 2018 as described in Note 21. In light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims since January 2002, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. We will continue to update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future Bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year. For additional information see Note 21. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers, our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers, various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers. Aerospace Sales Incentives We provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of our aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and braking system hardware and auxiliary power units, for installation on commercial aircraft. These incentives principally consist of free or deeply discounted products, but also include credits for future purchases of product and upfront cash payments. These costs are recognized in the period incurred as cost of products sold or as a reduction to sales, as appropriate. For aircraft manufacturers, incentives are recorded when the products are delivered; for airlines, incentives are recorded when the associated aircraft are delivered by the aircraft manufacturer to the airline. Research and Development Research and development costs for company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred. Such costs are principally included in Cost of Products Sold and were $1,799, $1,450 and $1,321 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Plans The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 20, include non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs). The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant in order to estimate the portion of the award that will ultimately vest. The estimate is based on our historical rates of forfeiture. Pension Benefits We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. We recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment). The remaining components of pension expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded on a quarterly basis (On-going Pension Expense). Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings. Derivative Financial Instruments As a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract. All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. Transfers of Financial Instruments Sales, transfers and securitization of financial instruments are accounted for under authoritative guidance for the transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities. We sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. The terms of the trade accounts receivable program permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion. As a result, these program receivables are not accounted for as a sale and remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as either Short-term borrowings or Long-term debt. At times we also transfer trade and other receivables that qualify as a sale and are thus are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the time they are sold. The value assigned to any subordinated interests and undivided interests retained in receivables sold is based on the relative fair values of the interests retained and sold. The carrying value of the retained interests approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the collection period for the receivables. Income Taxes Deferred tax liabilities or assets reflect temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting. Such amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the amount of a valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. The projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs. Additionally, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance and this guidance determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the tax filings of the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the form of accounting standards updates (ASUs) to the FASBs Accounting Standards Codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In May 2011, the FASB issued amendments to disclosure requirements for common fair value measurement. These amendments, effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011 (early adoption is prohibited), result in common definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Consequently, the amendments change some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements. The implementation of this amended accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In June 2011, the FASB issued amendments to disclosure requirements for presentation of comprehensive income. This guidance, effective retrospectively for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011 (early adoption is permitted), requires presentation of total comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the presentation on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for annual and interim financial statements. The implementation of the two aforementioned amendments is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In September 2011, the FASB issued amendments to the goodwill impairment guidance which provides an option for companies to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment if certain conditions are met. The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 (early adoption is permitted). The implementation of amended accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Note 2. Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisitions  We acquired businesses for an aggregate cost of $973, $1,303, and $468 million in 2011 2010 and 2009, respectively. For all of our acquisitions the acquired businesses were recorded at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Significant acquisitions made in these years are discussed below. In December 2011, the Company acquired Kings Safetywear Limited (KSW), a leading international provider of branded safety footwear. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was approximately $331 million (including the assumption of debt of $33 million) and was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. On a preliminary basis, the Company has assigned approximately $178 million to identifiable intangible assets, predominantly trademarks, technology, and customer relationships. The definite lived intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives, using straight-line and accelerated amortization methods. The value assigned to trademarks of approximately $91 million is classified as indefinite lived intangibles. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired (approximately $163 million), was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill arises primarily from the avoidance of the time and costs which would be required (and the associated risks that would be encountered) to enhance our product offerings to key target markets and serve as entry into new and profitable segments, and the expected cost synergies that will be realized through the consolidation of the acquired business into our Automation and Control Solutions segment. Their cost synergies are expected to be realized principally in the areas of selling, general and administrative expenses, material sourcing and manufacturing. This goodwill is nondeductible for tax purposes. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2011 are included in the Automation and Control Solutions segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2011, the purchase accounting for KSW is subject to final adjustment primarily for the valuation of inventory, property, plant and equipment, useful lives of intangible assets, amounts allocated to intangible assets and goodwill, tax balances, and for certain pre-acquisition contingencies. In August 2011, the Company acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of EMS Technologies, Inc. (EMS), a leading provider of connectivity solutions for mobile networking, rugged mobile computers and satellite communications. EMS had reported 2010 revenues of approximately $355 million. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was approximately $513 million and was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. On a preliminary basis, the Company has assigned approximately $119 million to identifiable intangible assets, of which approximately $89 million and approximately $30 million were recorded within the Aerospace and Automation and Control segments, respectively. The intangible assets are predominantly customer relationships, existing technology and trademarks. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives, using straight-line and accelerated amortization methods. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired (approximating $326 million), was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill arises primarily from the avoidance of the time and costs which would be required (and the associated risks that would be encountered) to enhance our product offerings to key target markets and serve as entry into new and profitable segments, and the expected cost synergies that will be realized through the consolidation of the acquired business into our Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments. These cost synergies are expected to be realized principally in the areas of selling, general and administrative expenses, material sourcing and manufacturing. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2011 are included in the Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2011, the purchase accounting for EMS is subject to final adjustment primarily for the valuation of inventory and property, plant and equipment, useful lives of intangible assets, amounts allocated to intangible assets and goodwill, and for certain pre-acquisition contingencies. In October 2010, we completed the acquisition of the issued and outstanding shares of Sperian Protection (Sperian), a French company that operates globally in the personal protection equipment design and manufacturing industry. Sperian had reported 2009 revenues of approximately $900 million. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was approximately $1,475 million (including the assumption of approximately $326 million of outstanding debt) and was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The following amounts represent the final determination of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. ##TABLE_START Accounts and other receivables  $   Inventories     Other current assets     Property, plant and equipment     Intangible assets     Other assets and deferred charges     Accounts payable   (63 )  Accrued liabilities   (114 )  Deferred income taxes   (156 )  Long-term debt   (326 )  Other long-term liabilities   (64 )     Net assets acquired     Goodwill        Purchase price  $ 1,149      ##TABLE_END We have assigned $539 million to intangible assets, predominantly customer relationships, trade names, and technology. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives which range from 3 to 20 years using straight line and accelerated amortization methods. Included in this amount, a value of approximately $246 million has been assigned to trade names intangibles determined to have indefinite lives. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is approximately $930 million and was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill arises primarily from the avoidance of the time and costs which would be required (and the associated risks that would be encountered) to develop a business with a product offering and customer base comparable to Sperian and the expected cost synergies that will be realized through the consolidation of the acquired business into our Automations and Controls Solutions segment. These cost synergies are expected to be realized principally in the areas of selling, general and administrative expenses, material sourcing and manufacturing. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2010 are included in the Automation and Control Solutions segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. In August 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of the RMG Group (RMG Regel + Messtechnik GmbH), a natural gas measuring and control products, services and integrated solutions company, for a purchase price of approximately $416 million, net of cash acquired. The purchase price for the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The Company has assigned $174 million to identifiable intangible assets, predominantly customer relationships, existing technology and trademarks. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives which range from 1 to 15 years using straight-line and accelerated amortization methods. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired (approximating $225 million), was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2009 are included in the Automation and Control Solutions segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with all acquisitions in 2011, 2010 and 2009, the amounts recorded for transaction costs and the costs of integrating the acquired businesses into Honeywell were not material. The pro forma results for 2011, 2010 and 2009, assuming these acquisitions had been made at the beginning of the comparable prior year, would not be materially different from consolidated reported results. Divestitures In July 2011, the Company sold its Consumer Products Group business (CPG) to Rank Group Limited. The sale was completed for approximately $955 million in cash proceeds, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $301 million and a pproximately $178 million net of tax. The gain was recorded in net income from discontinued operations after taxes in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. The net income attributable to the non-controlling interest for the discontinued operations is insignificant. The sale of CPG, which had been part of the Transportation Systems segment, is consistent with the Companys strategic focus on its portfolio of differentiated global technologies. The key components of income from discontinued operations related to CPG were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended December 31,           Net sales  $   $ 1,020   $   Costs, expenses and other           Selling, general and administrative expense           Other (income) expense   (2 )                  (Loss) income before taxes                    Gain on disposal of discontinued operations                      Net income from discontinued operations before taxes                    Tax expense                    Net income from discontinued operations after taxes  $   $   $           ##TABLE_END The components of assets and liabilities classified as discontinued operations and included in other current assets and other current liabilities related to the CPG business consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2010   Accounts, notes and other receivables  $  Inventories    Property, plant and equipment - net    Goodwill and other intangibles - net    Other      Total assets  $    Accounts payable  $  Accrued and other liabilities      Total liabilities  $    ##TABLE_END Note 3.

The workforce reductions were primarily related to the planned shutdown of a manufacturing facility in our Transportation Systems segment, cost savings actions taken in connection with our ongoing functional transformation and productivity initiatives, factory transitions in connection with acquisition-related synergies in our Automation and Control Solutions and Aerospace segments, the exit from and/or rationalization of certain product lines and markets in our Performance Materials and Technologies and Automation and Control Solutions segments, the consolidation of repair facilities in our Aerospace segment, and factory consolidations and/or rationalizations and organizational realignments of businesses in our Automation and Control Solutions segment. The repositioning charges included asset impairments of $86 million principally related to the write-off of certain intangible assets in our Automation and Control Solutions segment due to a change in branding strategy and manufacturing plant and equipment associated with the planned shutdown of a manufacturing facility and the exit of a product line and a factory transition as discussed above. The repositioning charges also included exit costs of $48 million principally for costs to terminate contracts related to the exit of a market and product line and a factory transition as discussed above. Exit costs also included closure obligations associated with the planned shutdown of a manufacturing facility and exit of a product line also as discussed above. Also, $26 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance at our Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments, were returned to income in 2011 due principally to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with prior severance programs. In 2010, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $179 million including severance costs of $144 million related to workforce reductions of 2,781 manufacturing and administrative positions primarily in our Automation and Control Solutions, Aerospace and Transportation Systems segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to the planned shutdown of certain manufacturing facilities in our Automation and Control Solutions and Transportation Systems segments, cost savings actions taken in connection with our ongoing functional transformation and productivity initiatives, factory transitions in our Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions and Performance Materials and Technologies segments to more cost-effective locations, achieving acquisition-related synergies in our Automation and Control Solutions segment, and the exit and/or rationalization of certain product lines in our Performance Materials and Technologies segment. The repositioning charge also included asset impairments of $21 million principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment associated with the exit and/or rationalization of certain product lines and in facilities scheduled to close. Also, $30 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance at our Automation and Control Solutions, Transportation Systems and Aerospace segments, were returned to income in 2010 due to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with prior severance programs. In 2009, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $213 million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 4,145 manufacturing and administrative positions mainly in our Automation and Control Solutions, Transportation Systems and Aerospace segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to the adverse market conditions experienced by many of our businesses, cost savings actions taken in connection with our ongoing functional transformation initiative, the planned downsizing or shutdown of certain manufacturing facilities, and organizational realignments of portions of our Aerospace and Transportation Systems segments. Also, $53 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance at our Automation and Control Solutions, Aerospace, and Transportation Systems segments, were returned to income in 2009 due to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with prior severance programs and changes in the scope of previously announced repositioning actions.

Certain repositioning projects in our Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions and Transportation Systems segments included exit or disposal activities, the costs related to which will be recognized in future periods when the actual liability is incurred. The nature of these exit or disposal costs includes asset set-up and moving, product recertification and requalification, and employee retention, training and travel. The following tables summarize by segment, expected, incurred and remaining exit and disposal costs related to 2011 and 2010 repositioning actions which we were not able to recognize at the time the actions were initiated. ##TABLE_START 2011 Repositioning Actions  Aerospace  Automation and Control Solutions  Transportation Systems  Total          Expected exit and disposal costs  $   $   $   $  Costs incurred year ended December 31, 2011   (1 )           (1 )            Remaining exit and disposal costs at December 31, 2011  $   $   $   $             ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 2010 Repositioning Actions  Aerospace  Automation and Control Solutions  Transportation Systems  Total         Expected exit and disposal costs  $   $   $   $  Costs incurred year ended December 31, 2011   (2 )   (3 )   (1 )   (6 ) Costs incurred year ended December 31, 2010                            Remaining exit and disposal costs at December 31, 2011  $   $   $   $             ##TABLE_END In 2011, we recognized a charge of $240 million for environmental liabilities deemed probable and reasonably estimable during the year. We recognized asbestos related litigation charges, net of insurance, of $149 million. Environmental and Asbestos matters are discussed in detail in Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies. In 2010, we recognized a charge of $212 million for environmental liabilities deemed probable and reasonably estimable during the year. We recognized asbestos related litigation charges, net of insurance, of $175 million. We also recognized other charges of $62 million in connection with the evaluation of potential resolution of certain legal matters. In 2009, we recognized a charge of $145 million for environmental liabilities deemed probable and reasonably estimable during the year. We recognized asbestos related litigation charges, net of insurance, of $155 million. Note 4.

Other, net in 2011 includes a loss of $29 million resulting from early redemption of debt in the first quarter of 2011. See Note 14 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements for further details. Other, net for 2010 includes a $62 million pre-tax gain, $39 million net of tax, related to the consolidation of a joint venture within our Performance Materials and Technologies segment. The Company obtained control and the ability to direct those activities most significant to the joint ventures economic performance in the third quarter, resulting in consolidation. Accordingly, we have i) recognized the assets and liabilities at fair value, ii) included the results of operations in the consolidated financial statements from the date of consolidation and iii) recognized the above noted gain representing the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of our previously held equity method investment. The Company has assigned $24 million to intangibles, predominantly the joint ventures customer contracts. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives using the straight line method. The excess of the book value over the estimated fair values of the net assets consolidated approximating $132 million, was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. The results from the consolidation date through December 31, 2010 are included in the Performance Materials and Technologies segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. Gain on sale of non-strategic businesses and assets for 2009 includes a $50 million pre-tax gain, $42 million net of tax, related to the deconsolidation of a subsidiary within our Automation and Control Solutions segment. The subsidiary achieved contractual milestones at December 31, 2009 and as a result, we are no longer the primary beneficiary, resulting in deconsolidation. We continue to hold a non-controlling interest which was recorded at its estimated fair value of $67 million upon deconsolidation. The fair value was estimated using a combination of a market and income approaches utilizing observable market data for comparable businesses and discounted cash flow modeling.

The foreign effective tax rate was 21.1 percent, a decrease of approximately 4.9 percentage points which primarily consisted of (i) a 5.1 percent impact from decreased valuation allowances on net operating losses primarily due to an increase in German earnings available to be offset by net operating loss carry forwards; (ii) a 2.4 percent impact from tax benefits related to foreign exchange and investment losses; iii) a 1.2 percent impact from an increased benefit in tax credits and lower statutory tax rates and (iv) a 4.1 percent impact related to an increase in tax reserves. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign rates. The effective tax rate increased by 5.9 percentage points in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings related to lower U.S. pension expense, the impact of an enacted change in the tax treatment of the Medicare Part D program, the absence of manufacturing incentives, a decreased impact from the settlement of audits and an increase in the foreign effective tax rate. The foreign effective tax rate increased by approximately 7 percentage points which primarily consisted of i) a 6 percentage point impact from the absence of tax benefits related to foreign exchange and investment losses and ii) a (0.1) percentage point impact from increased valuation allowances on net operating losses. Deferred tax assets (liabilities) Deferred income taxes represent the future tax effects of transactions which are reported in different periods for tax and financial reporting purposes. The tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which give rise to future income tax benefits and payables are as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 31,           Property, plant and equipment basis differences  $ (1,097 )  $ (1,107 ) Postretirement benefits other than pensions and post employment benefits       Investment and other asset basis differences   (970 )   (993 ) Other accrued items   2,852    2,348  Net operating and capital losses       Tax credits       Undistributed earnings of subsidiaries   (57 )   (40 ) All other itemsnet   (67 )             2,421    2,019  Valuation allowance   (591 )   (636 )         $ 1,830   $ 1,383        ##TABLE_END There were $3 million of U.S. federal tax net operating losses available for carryforward at December 31, 2011 which have expiration dates through 2029. The Company has state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $3.5 billion at December 31, 2011 with varying expiration dates through 2032. We also have foreign net operating and capital losses of $2.7 billion which are available to reduce future income tax payments in several countries, subject to varying expiration rules. We have U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards of $35 million at December 31, 2011, including alternative minimum tax credits which are not subject to expiration. We also have state tax credit carryforwards of $61 million at December 31, 2011, including carryforwards of $38 million with various expiration dates through 2026 and tax credits of $23 million which are not subject to expiration. The valuation allowance against deferred tax assets decreased by $45 million in 2011 and increased by $58 million and $133 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2011 decrease in the valuation allowance was primarily due to decreased foreign net operating losses related to the Netherlands and Germany, partially offset by the increase in the valuation allowance of France, Luxembourg and Canada. The 2010 increase in the valuation allowance was primarily due to increased foreign net operating losses related to France, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands offset by the reversal of a valuation allowance related to Germany. The 2010 increase in valuation allowance also includes adjustments related to purchase accounting for various acquisitions. The 2009 increase in the valuation allowance was primarily due to increased foreign net operating losses related to Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Federal income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of the majority of our international subsidiaries as it is our intention to reinvest these earnings into the respective subsidiaries. At December 31, 2011 Honeywell has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $8.1 billion of such earnings of our non-U.S. operations. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability. We had $815 million, $757 million and $720 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 respectively. If recognized, $815 million would be recorded as a component of income tax expense as of December 31, 2011. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company increased its unrecognized tax benefits by $58 million and $37 million, respectively, due to additional reserves for various international and U.S. tax audit matters, partially offset by adjustments related to our ongoing assessments of the likelihood and amount of potential outcomes of current and future examinations, the expiration of various statute of limitations, and settlements with tax authorities. The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START           Change in unrecognized tax benefits:             Balance at beginning of year  $   $   $  Gross increases related to current period tax positions          Gross increases related to prior periods tax positions          Gross decreases related to prior periods tax positions   (56 )   (41 )   (77 ) Decrease related to settlements with tax authorities   (237 )   (23 )   (44 ) Expiration of the statute of limitations for the assessment of taxes   (12 )   (8 )   (8 ) Foreign currency translation   (10 )   (12 )             Balance at end of year  $   $   $           ##TABLE_END Generally, our uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. The following table summarizes these open tax years by major jurisdiction as of December 31, 2011: ##TABLE_START   Open Tax Year  Jurisdiction  Examination in progress  Examination not yet initiated    United States (1)  20012009  20052011 United Kingdom  N/A  2010-2011 Canada (1)  2006-2010  Germany (1)  2004-2009  2010-2011 France  2009-2010  20002008, 2011 Netherlands  2007-2009  2010-2011 Australia  N/A  2009-2011 China  2009-2010  2006-2008, 2011 India  20002009  2010-2011 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) includes federal as well as state, provincial or similar local jurisdictions, as applicable. ##TABLE_END Based on the outcome of these examinations, or as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns will materially change from those recorded as liabilities for uncertain tax positions in our financial statements. In addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods. Based on the number of tax years currently under audit by the relevant U.S federal, state and foreign tax authorities, the Company anticipates that several of these audits may be finalized in the foreseeable future. However, based on the status of these examinations, the protocol of finalizing audits by the relevant taxing authorities, and the possibility that the Company might challenge certain audit findings (which could include formal legal proceedings), at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact of any amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits for examinations in progress were $482 million, $274 million and $261 million, as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. These increases are primarily due to an increase in tax examinations. Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of Tax Expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and totaled $63 million, $33 million and $13 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties were $247 million, $183 million and $150 million, as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Note 7.

In 2011, 2010, and 2009 the weighted number of stock options excluded from the computations were 9.5, 14.8, and 34.0 million, respectively. These stock options were outstanding at the end of each of the respective periods. Note 8.

The Notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywells existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of Honeywells subordinated debt. The offering resulted in gross proceeds of $1,400 million, offset by $19 million in discount and closing costs related to the offering. In the first quarter of 2011, the Company repurchased the entire outstanding principal amount of its $400 million 5.625 percent Notes due 2012 via a cash tender offer and a subsequent optional redemption. The cost relating to the early redemption of the Notes, including the make-whole premium, was $29 million. In March 2011, the Company entered into a $2,800 million Five Year Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks. Commitments under the Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $3,500 million. The Credit Agreement contains a $700 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes, including support for the issuance of commercial paper, and replaces the previous $2,800 million five year credit agreement dated May 14, 2007 (Prior Agreement). There have been no borrowings under the Credit Agreement or the Prior Agreement. The Credit Agreement does not restrict our ability to pay dividends and contains no financial covenants. The failure to comply with customary conditions or the occurrence of customary events of default contained in the credit agreement would prevent any further borrowings and would generally require the repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement. Such events of default include: (a) non-payment of credit agreement debt, interest or fees; (b) non-compliance with the terms of the credit agreement covenants; (c) cross-default to other debt in certain circumstances; (d) bankruptcy; and (e) defaults upon obligations under Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Additionally, each of the banks has the right to terminate its commitment to lend additional funds or issue letters of credit under the agreement if any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 30 percent or more of our voting stock, or, during any 12-month period, individuals who were directors of Honeywell at the beginning of the period cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors. Loans under the Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no later than March 31, 2016. We have agreed to pay a facility fee of 0.125 percent per annum on the aggregate commitment. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Agreement would be determined, at Honeywells option, by (a) a competitive bidding procedure; (b) the highest of the floating base rate publicly announced by Citibank, N.A. 0.5 percent above the Federal funds rate or Libor plus 1 percent; or (c) the Eurocurrency rate plus Honeywells credit default swap spread, subject to a floor and a cap (applicable margin). The facility fee, the applicable margin over the Eurocurrency rate and the letter of credit issuance fee, are subject to change, based upon a grid determined by our long term debt ratings. The Credit Agreement is not subject to termination based upon a decrease in our debt ratings or a material adverse change. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company repaid $500 million of its 6.125% notes. The repayment was funded with cash provided by operating activities. In the first quarter of 2010, the Company repaid $1,000 million of its 7.50% notes. The repayment was funded with cash provided by operating activities. As a source of liquidity, we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, none of the receivables in the designated pools had been sold to third parties. When we sell receivables, they are over-collateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that over-collateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools. The terms of the trade accounts receivable program permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion, providing us with an additional source of revolving credit. As a result, program receivables remain on the Companys balance sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as either Short-term borrowings or Long-term debt. Note 15. Lease Commitments Future minimum lease payments under operating leases having initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows: ##TABLE_START   At December 31, 2011    2012  $              Thereafter         $ 1,213     ##TABLE_END We have entered into agreements to lease land, equipment and buildings. Principally all our operating leases have initial terms of up to 25 years, and some contain renewal options subject to customary conditions. At any time during the terms of some of our leases, we may at our option purchase the leased assets for amounts that approximate fair value. We do not expect that any of our commitments under the lease agreements will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Rent expense was $386, $369 and $366 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Note 16. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures  Credit and Market Risk Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers.  Foreign Currency Risk Management We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. Our objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency denominated cash flows. We attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts with third parties. We hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in Other (Income) Expense. We partially hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which predominantly occur in the next twelve months and are denominated in non-functional currencies, with currency forward contracts. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the currency forward contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. Open foreign currency exchange forward contracts mature predominantly in the next twelve months. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had contracts with notional amounts of $7,108 million and $5,733 million, respectively, to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Mexican peso, Swiss franc, Czech koruna, Chinese renminbi, Indian rupee, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Korean won and Thai baht.  Commodity Price Risk Management Our exposure to market risk for commodity prices can result in changes in our cost of production. We primarily mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk through the use of long-term, fixed-price contracts with our suppliers and formula price agreements with suppliers and customers. We also enter into forward commodity contracts with third parties designated as hedges of anticipated purchases of several commodities. Forward commodity contracts are marked-to-market, with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had contracts with notional amounts of $59 million and $23 million, respectively, related to forward commodity agreements, principally base metals and natural gas.  Interest Rate Risk Management We use a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively changed $1,400 and $600 million, respectively, of fixed rate debt at a rate of 4.09 and 3.88 percent, respectively, to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Our interest rate swaps mature through 2021.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The FASBs accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The FASBs guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy: ##TABLE_START  Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities       Level 2 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or    Unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or    Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability       Level 3 Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  ##TABLE_END The Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company has determined that our available for sale investments in marketable equity securities are level 1 and our remaining financial assets and liabilities are level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2011 and 2010: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2011  December 31, 2010    Assets:        Foreign currency exchange contracts  $  $  Available for sale investments      Interest rate swap agreements      Forward commodity contracts              Liabilities:        Foreign currency exchange contracts  $  $  Forward commodity contracts      ##TABLE_END The foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate swap agreements, and forward commodity contracts are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale and are valued using market transactions in over-the-counter markets. As such, these investments are classified within level 2. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were not carried at fair value: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2011   December 31, 2010        Carrying Value  Fair Value   Carrying Value  Fair Value       Assets               Long-term receivables  $  $   $  $  Liabilities               Long-term debt and related current maturities  $ 6,896  $ 7,896   $ 6,278  $ 6,835  ##TABLE_END In the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had assets with a net book value of $262 million and $32 million, respectively, specifically property, plant and equipment, software and intangible assets, which were accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets were tested for impairment and based on the fair value of these assets the Company recognized losses of $127 million and $30 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, primarily in connection with our repositioning actions (see Note 3 Repositioning and Other Charges). The Company has determined that the fair value measurements of these nonfinancial assets are level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company holds investments in marketable equity securities that are designated as available for sale securities. Due to an other-than-temporary decline in fair value of these investments, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $62 million in the second quarter of 2009 that is included in Other (Income) Expense. The derivatives utilized for risk management purposes as detailed above are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and impacted the Statement of Operations as follows: Fair value of derivatives classified as assets consist of the following: ##TABLE_START Designated as a Hedge  Balance Sheet Classification  December 31, 2011  December 31, 2010        Foreign currency exchange contracts  Accounts, notes, and other receivables  $   $   Interest rate swap agreements  Other assets        Commodity contracts  Accounts, notes, and other receivables                    Not Designated as a Hedge  Balance Sheet Classification  December 31, 2011  December 31, 2010        Foreign currency exchange contracts  Accounts, notes, and other receivables  $   $              Fair value of derivatives classified as liabilities consist of the following:             Designated as a Hedge  Balance Sheet Classification  December 31, 2011  December 31, 2010        Foreign currency exchange contracts  Accrued liabilities  $   $   Commodity contracts  Accrued liabilities                    Not Designated as a Hedge  Balance Sheet Classification  December 31, 2011  December 31, 2010        Foreign currency exchange contracts  Accrued liabilities  $   $   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Gains (losses) recognized in OCI (effective portions) consist of the following:           Year Ended December 31,  Designated Cash Flow Hedge         Foreign currency exchange contracts  $ (42 ) $  Commodity contracts   (12 )  (7 ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI to income consist of the following:               Year Ended December 31, Designated Cash Flow Hedge  Income Statement Location          Foreign currency exchange contracts  Product sales  $  $ (19 )   Cost of products sold   (34 )     Sales  general administrative   (8 )  (3 )           Commodity contracts  Cost of products sold  $ (2 ) $ (8 ) ##TABLE_END Ineffective portions of commodity derivative instruments designated in cash flow hedge relationships were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 and are located in cost of products sold. Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or (losses) on the derivative recognized in Interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt being hedged. Gains or (losses) on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $112 and $24 million in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 respectively. These gains were fully offset by losses on the underlying debt being hedged. We also economically hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts. These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. We recognized $30 million of income and $18 million of expense, in Other (Income) Expense for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Note 17.

Capital Stock We are authorized to issue up to 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $1. Common shareowners are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by the Board, are entitled to one vote per share, and are entitled, in the event of liquidation, to share ratably in all the assets of Honeywell which are available for distribution to the common shareowners. Common shareowners do not have preemptive or conversion rights. Shares of common stock issued and outstanding or held in the treasury are not liable to further calls or assessments. There are no restrictions on us relative to dividends or the repurchase or redemption of common stock. The Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $3.0 billion of Honeywell common stock, which amount includes $1.9 billion that remained available under the Companys previously reported share repurchase program. We purchased a total of approximately 20.3 million shares of our common stock in 2011 for $1,085 million. We are authorized to issue up to 40,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value, and can determine the number of shares of each series, and the rights, preferences and limitations of each series. At December 31, 2011, there was no preferred stock outstanding. Note 19. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Total accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is included in the Consolidated Statement of Shareowners Equity. Comprehensive Income (Loss) attributable to non-controlling interest consisted predominantly of net income.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans We have stock-based compensation plans available to grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted units and restricted stock to key employees. The 2011 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (the Plan) was approved by the shareowners at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners effective on April 26, 2011. Following approval of the Plan on April 26, 2011 we have not and will not grant any new awards to key employees under any previously existing stock-based compensation plans. There were 39,582,132 shares available for future grants under the terms of the Plan at December 31, 2011. Additionally, under the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (the Directors Plan) there were 229,000 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grant as of December 31, 2011. Stock Options  The exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under our stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of our stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employees requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Honeywell common stock. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The expected term represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Compensation cost on a pre-tax basis related to stock options recognized in operating results (included in selling, general and administrative expenses) in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $59, $55 and $39 million, respectively. The associated future income tax benefit recognized in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $19, $16 and $13 million, respectively. The following table sets forth fair value per share information, including related weighted-average assumptions, used to determine compensation cost: ##TABLE_START   Years Ended December 31,                 Weighted average fair value per share of options granted during the year (1)  $ 12.56   $ 8.96   $ 6.73  Assumptions:             Expected annual dividend yield   2.68 %   3.00 %   4.26 % Expected volatility   27.60 %   29.39 %   35.78 % Risk-free rate of return   2.47 %   2.64 %   2.53 % Expected option term (years)   5.8    5.4    5.8  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Estimated on date of grant using Black-Scholes option-pricing model. ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes information about stock option activity for the three years ended December 31, 2011: ##TABLE_START   Number of Options   Weighted Average Exercise Price      Outstanding at December 31, 2008   40,933,522   $ 43.97  Granted   9,159,650    28.40  Exercised   (645,201 )   31.66  Lapsed or canceled   (8,537,598 )   53.90     Outstanding at December 31, 2009   40,910,373    38.58  Granted   7,607,950    40.29  Exercised   (5,211,526 )   34.77  Lapsed or canceled   (2,515,266 )   44.14     Outstanding at December 31, 2010   40,791,531    39.05  Granted   7,625,950    57.08  Exercised   (7,984,840 )   36.39  Lapsed or canceled   (1,516,271 )   42.38     Outstanding at December 31, 2011   38,916,370   $ 43.01     Vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2011 (1)   35,845,642   $ 42.49     Exercisable at December 31, 2011   21,672,281   $ 40.71     ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Represents the sum of vested options of 21.7 million and expected to vest options of 14.1 million.

There were 24,722,493 and 27,427,023 options exercisable at weighted average exercise prices of $39.43 and $38.85 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options (which is the amount by which the stock price exceeded the exercise price of the options on the date of exercise) exercised during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $164, $54 and $4 million, respectively. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $290, $181 and $20 million, respectively, with an associated tax benefit realized of $54, $18 and $1 million, respectively. In 2011, 2010 and 2009 we classified $42, $13 and $1 million, respectively, of this benefit as a financing cash inflow in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and the balance was classified as cash from operations. At December 31, 2011 there was $119 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock option awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.52 years. The total fair value of options vested during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $52, $41 and $51 million, respectively. Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock unit (RSU) awards entitle the holder to receive one share of common stock for each unit when the units vest. RSUs are issued to certain key employees at fair market value at the date of grant as compensation. RSUs typically become fully vested over periods ranging from three to seven years and are payable in Honeywell common stock upon vesting. The following table summarizes information about RSU activity for the three years ended December 31, 2011: ##TABLE_START   Number of Restricted Stock Units  Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share    Non-vested at December 31, 2008  6,825,717   $  46.63   Granted  3,691,129     30.16   Vested  (1,313,975 )    40.44   Forfeited  (940,094 )    44.51     Non-vested at December 31, 2009  8,262,777     40.49   Granted  3,842,367     42.33   Vested  (1,593,979 )    48.71   Forfeited  (537,212 )    40.45     Non-vested at December 31, 2010  9,973,953     39.89   Granted  1,887,733     55.11   Vested  (1,509,528 )    49.48   Forfeited  (605,725 )    40.11     Non-vested at December 31, 2011  9,746,433   $  41.35     ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2011, there was approximately $179 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs granted under our stock plans which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years. Compensation expense related to RSUs was $109, $109 and $79 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Non-Employee Directors Plan Under the Directors Plan each new non-employee director receives a one-time grant of 3,000 restricted stock units that will vest on the fifth anniversary of continuous Board service. In 2011, each non-employee director received an annual grant to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock at the fair market value on the date of grant. In 2012, the annual equity grant will change from a fixed number of shares to a target value of $75,000 and will consist of 50 percent options and 50 percent RSUs. Options will become exercisable over a four-year period and expire after ten years. RSUs will generally vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant. Note 21. Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded liabilities for environmental costs: ##TABLE_START   Years Ended December 31,         Beginning of year  $    $    $   Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable             Environmental liability payments    (270 )    (266 )    (318 ) Other                           End of year  $    $    $               ##TABLE_END Environmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2011  December 31, 2010    Accrued liabilities  $    $    Other liabilities                    $    $            ##TABLE_END Although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that these environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. New Jersey Chrome Sites The excavation and offsite disposal of approximately one million tons of chromium residue present at a predecessor Honeywell site located in Jersey City, New Jersey, known as Study Area 7, was completed in January 2010. We are also implementing related groundwater remedial actions, and are seeking the appropriate permits from state and federal agencies for related river sediment work approved by the federal court. Provisions have been made in our financial statements for the estimated cost of these remedies. The above-referenced site is the most significant of the 21 sites located in Hudson County, New Jersey that are the subject of an Administrative Consent Order (ACO) entered into with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) in 1993 (the Honeywell ACO Sites). Remedial investigations and activities consistent with the ACO and other applicable settlement orders have been conducted and are underway at the other Honeywell ACO Sites. In addition, a settlement order was entered by the New Jersey State Superior Court in the third quarter of 2011 resolving litigation brought by the NJDEP against Honeywell and two other companies regarding the investigation and remediation of the remaining sites in the area that allegedly have chromium contamination (known as the Publicly Funded Sites). Under the settlement, Honeywell has accepted responsibility to remediate 24 of the 53 Publicly Funded Sites and will also bear 50 percent of the costs at another 10 Publicly Funded Sites. Honeywell is developing a schedule for the investigation and remediation of these Publicly Funded Sites. We have recorded reserves for the Honeywell ACO Sites and the applicable Publicly Funded Sites where appropriate under the accounting policy described above. Dundalk Marine Terminal, Baltimore, MD Chrome residue from legacy chrome plant operations in Baltimore was deposited as fill at the Dundalk Marine Terminal (DMT), which is owned and operated by the Maryland Port Administration (MPA). Honeywell and the MPA have been sharing costs to investigate and mitigate related environmental issues, and have entered into a cost sharing agreement under which Honeywell will bear 77 percent of the costs of developing and implementing permanent remedies for the DMT facility. In January 2011, the MPA and Honeywell submitted to the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) a Corrective Measures Alternatives Analysis (CMAA) of certain potential remedies for DMT to assist MDE in selection of a final remedy, which has not yet occurred. Provision has been made in our financial statements for the CMAA consistent with the accounting policy described above. We have negotiated a Consent Decree with the MPA and MDE with respect to the investigation and remediation of the DMT facility. The Consent Decree is being challenged in federal court by BUILD, a Baltimore community group, together with a local church and two individuals (collectively BUILD). In October 2007, the Court dismissed with prejudice BUILDs state law claims and dismissed without prejudice BUILDs RCRA claims regarding neighborhoods near the DMT facility. In August 2008, the Court held a hearing on the Companys motion to dismiss BUILDs remaining claims on the grounds that MDE is diligently prosecuting the investigation and remediation of the DMT. We are awaiting the Courts decision. We do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or operating cash flows. Given the scope and complexity of this project, it is possible that the cost of remediation, when determinable, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the periods recognized. Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, NY We are implementing a combined dredging/capping remedy of Onondaga Lake pursuant to a consent decree approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York in January 2007. We have accrued for our estimated cost of remediating Onondaga Lake based on currently available information and analysis performed by our engineering consultants. Honeywell is also conducting remedial investigations and activities at other sites in Syracuse. We have recorded reserves for these investigations and activities where appropriate under the accounting policy described above. Honeywell has entered into a cooperative agreement with potential natural resource trustees to assess alleged natural resource damages relating to this site. It is not possible to predict the outcome or duration of this assessment, or the amounts of, or responsibility for, any damages. Asbestos Matters Like many other industrial companies, Honeywell is a defendant in personal injury actions related to asbestos. We did not mine or produce asbestos, nor did we make or sell insulation products or other construction materials that have been identified as the primary cause of asbestos related disease in the vast majority of claimants. Honeywells predecessors owned North American Refractories Company (NARCO) from 1979 to 1986. NARCO produced refractory products (bricks and cement used in high temperature applications). We sold the NARCO business in 1986 and agreed to indemnify NARCO with respect to personal injury claims for products that had been discontinued prior to the sale (as defined in the sale agreement). NARCO retained all liability for all other claims. NARCO and/or Honeywell are defendants in asbestos personal injury cases asserting claims based upon alleged exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products. Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing refractory products in an occupational setting. These claims, and the filing of subsequent claims, have been stayed continuously since January 4, 2002, the date on which NARCO sought bankruptcy protection (see discussion below). Honeywells Bendix friction materials (Bendix) business manufactured automotive brake parts that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form. Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of individuals who performed brake replacements. The following tables summarize information concerning NARCO and Bendix asbestos related balances: ##TABLE_START         Asbestos Related Liabilities   Year Ended December 31, 2011  Year Ended December 31, 2010  Year Ended December 31, 2009       Bendix  NARCO  Total  Bendix  NARCO  Total  Bendix  NARCO  Total           Beginning of year  $    $  1,125   $  1,719   $    $  1,128   $  1,694   $    $  1,131   $  1,709   Accrual for update to estimated liability                                      Change in estimated cost of future claims                                         Update of expected resolution values for pending claims                              (2 )         (2 )  Asbestos related liability payments    (166 )    (5 )    (171 )    (157 )    (6 )    (163 )    (148 )    (8 )    (156 )                                      End of year  $    $  1,123   $  1,736   $    $  1,125   $  1,719   $    $  1,128   $  1,694                                       ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Insurance Recoveries for Asbestos Related Liabilities                                Year Ended December 31, 2011  Year Ended December 31, 2010  Year Ended December 31, 2009       Bendix  NARCO  Total  Bendix  NARCO  Total  Bendix  NARCO  Total           Beginning of year  $    $    $    $    $    $  1,003   $    $    $  1,033   Probable insurance recoveries related to estimated liability                                         Insurance receipts for asbestos related liabilities    (34 )    (100 )    (134 )    (41 )    (100 )    (141 )    (8 )    (8 )    (16 )  Insurance receivables settlements and write offs                      (13 )    (13 )         (38 )    (38 )                                      End of year  $    $    $    $    $    $    $    $    $  1,003                                       ##TABLE_END NARCO and Bendix asbestos related balances are included in the following balance sheet accounts: ##TABLE_START   December 31,       Other current assets  $   $  Insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities               $   $                 Accrued liabilities  $   $  Asbestos related liabilities   1,499    1,557          $ 1,736   $ 1,719        ##TABLE_END NARCO Products  On January 4, 2002, NARCO filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In connection with the filing of NARCOs petition in 2002, the Bankruptcy Court issued an injunction staying the prosecution of NARCO-related asbestos claims against the Company, which stay has continuously remained in place. In November 2007, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania confirmed NARCOs Third Amended Plan of Reorganization (NARCO Plan of Reorganization). All challenges to the NARCO Plan of Reorganization were fully resolved in the third quarter of 2010. The NARCO Plan of Reorganization cannot become effective, however, until unrelated issues pertaining to certain NARCO affiliates which are pending in Bankruptcy Court are resolved. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of the Bankruptcy Court proceedings in the affiliates case or whether discussions between the parties will resolve the matter. We expect that the stay enjoining litigation against NARCO and Honeywell will remain in effect until the effective date of the NARCO Plan of Reorganization. In connection with NARCOs bankruptcy filing, we agreed to certain obligations which will be triggered upon the effective date of the NARCO Plan of Reorganization. Honeywell will provide NARCO with $20 million in financing and simultaneously forgive such indebtedness. We will also pay $40 million to NARCOs former parent company and $16 million to certain asbestos claimants whose claims were resolved during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings. These amounts have been classified as Accrued Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011. When the NARCO Plan of Reorganization becomes effective, in connection with its implementation, a federally authorized 524(g) trust (NARCO Trust) will be established for the evaluation and resolution of all existing and future NARCO asbestos claims. When the NARCO Trust is established, both Honeywell and NARCO will be entitled to a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based on exposure to NARCO products to be made against the Trust. The NARCO Trust will review submitted claims and determine award amounts in accordance with established Trust Distribution Procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court which set forth all criteria claimants must meet to qualify for compensation including, among other things, exposure and medical criteria that determine the award amount. Once the NARCO Trust is established and operational, Honeywell will be obligated to fund NARCO asbestos claims submitted to the trust which qualify for payment under the Trust Distribution Procedures, subject to annual caps up to $150 million in any year, provided, however, that the first $100 million of claims processed through the NARCO Trust (the Initial Claims Amount) will not count against the first year annual cap and any unused portion of the Initial Claims Amount will roll over to subsequent years until fully utilized. Once the NARCO Trust is established and operational, Honeywell will also be responsible for the following funding obligations which are not subject to the annual cap described above: a) previously approved payments due to claimants pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings which provide that a portion of these settlements is to be paid by the NARCO Trust, which amounts are estimated at $130 million and are expected to be paid during the first year of trust operations and, b) payments due to claimants pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and Trust Distribution Procedures criteria, which amounts are estimated at $150 million and are expected to be paid during the first two years of trust operations. Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for the amounts discussed above, unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection and for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust through 2018. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims since January 2002, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. In the absence of actual trust experience on which to base the estimate, Honeywell projected the probable value, including trust claim handling costs, of asbestos related future liabilities based on Company specific and general asbestos claims filing rates, expected rates of disease and anticipated claim values. Specifically, the valuation methodology included an analysis of the population likely to have been exposed to asbestos containing products, epidemiological studies to estimate the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases, NARCO asbestos claims filing history, general asbestos claims filing rates in the tort system and in certain operating asbestos trusts, and the claims experience in those forums, the pending inventory of NARCO asbestos claims, disease criteria and payment values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures and an estimated approval rate of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust. This methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims has been commonly accepted by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts and resulted in a range of estimated liability for future claims of $743 to $961 million. We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. Our insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of pending and future NARCO asbestos claims reflects coverage which reimburses Honeywell for portions of the costs incurred to settle NARCO related claims and court judgments as well as defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. At December 31, 2011, a significant portion of this coverage is with insurance companies with whom we have agreements to pay full policy limits. We conduct analyses to determine the amount of insurance that we estimate is probable of recovery in relation to payment of current and estimated future claims. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. We made judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings with our insurers, our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers and various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs. In 2006, Travelers Casualty and Insurance Company (Travelers) filed a declaratory judgment action in the Supreme Court of New York, County of New York against Honeywell and other insurance carriers that provide coverage for NARCO asbestos claims, seeking a declaration regarding coverage obligations for NARCO asbestos claims under high excess insurance coverage issued by Travelers and the other insurance carriers. The other insurance carriers asserted cross claims against Honeywell seeking declarations regarding their coverage obligations for NARCO asbestos claims under high excess insurance coverage issued by them. Since then, the Company has entered into settlement agreements resolving all NARCO-related asbestos coverage issues with certain of these insurance carriers, including Travelers. Approximately $57 million of remaining unsettled coverage is included in our NARCO-related insurance receivable at December 31, 2011. Honeywell believes it is entitled to the coverage at issue and expects to prevail in this matter. In 2007, Honeywell prevailed on a critical choice of law issue concerning the appropriate method of allocating NARCO-related asbestos liabilities to triggered policies. The plaintiffs appealed and the trial courts ruling was upheld by the intermediate appellate court in 2009. Plaintiffs further appeal to the New York Court of Appeals, the highest court in New York, was denied in October 2009. A related New Jersey action brought by Honeywell has been dismissed, but all coverage claims against plaintiffs have been preserved in the New York action. Based upon (i) our understanding of relevant facts and applicable law, (ii) the terms of insurance policies at issue, (iii) our experience on matters of this nature, and (iv) the advice of counsel, we believe that the amount due from the remaining insurance carriers is probable of recovery. While Honeywell expects to prevail in this matter, an adverse outcome could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period recognized but would not be material to our consolidated financial position or operating cash flows. Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the NARCO related asbestos liabilities or assets to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. There is no assurance that the plan of reorganization will become final, that insurance recoveries will be timely or whether there will be any NARCO related asbestos claims beyond 2018. Given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future events, we review our estimates periodically, and update them based on our experience and other relevant factors. Similarly, we will reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability or other developments that may impact insurance recoveries. Friction Products The following tables present information regarding Bendix related asbestos claims activity: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended December 31,   Claims Activity       Claims Unresolved at the beginning of year    22,480     19,940   Claims Filed (a)    3,592     4,302   Claims Resolved (b)    (3,501 )    (1,762 )        Claims Unresolved at the end of year    22,571     22,480         ##TABLE_END (a) The number of claims filed in 2010 includes approximately 1,541 non-malignant claims (with an accrued liability of approximately $575 thousand in the aggregate), a majority of which had previously been dismissed in Mississippi and re-filed in Arkansas. (b) The number of claims resolved in 2011 includes approximately 351 claims previously classified as inactive (82% non-malignant and accrued liability of approximately $1.7 million) which were activated during 2011. The number of claims resolved in 2010 includes approximately 1,300 claims previously classified as inactive (95% non-malignant and accrued liability of approximately $2.0 million) which were activated during 2010. ##TABLE_START   December 31,   Disease Distribution of Unresolved Claims                   Mesothelioma and Other Cancer Claims    4,943     4,856   Nonmalignant Claims    17,628     17,624         Total Claims    22,571     22,480         ##TABLE_END Honeywell has experienced average resolution values per claim excluding legal costs as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended December 31,                 (in whole dollars)  Malignant claims  $ 48,000   $ 54,000   $ 50,000   $ 65,000   $ 33,000   Nonmalignant claims  $ 1,000   $ 1,300   $   $ 1,500   $   ##TABLE_END It is not possible to predict whether resolution values for Bendix related asbestos claims will increase, decrease or stabilize in the future. Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of pending (claims actually filed as of the financial statement date) and future Bendix related asbestos claims. We have valued Bendix pending and future claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix pending and future claims during the fourth quarter each year. The liability for future claims represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury claims expected to be asserted against Bendix over the next five years. Such estimated cost of future Bendix related asbestos claims is based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. The methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims is similar to that used to estimate the future NARCO related asbestos claims liability. Our insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of pending and future Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the solvency of our insurers, our interpretation of judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with our insurers. Insurance receivables are also recorded when structured insurance settlements provide for future fixed payment streams that are not contingent upon future claims or other events. Such amounts are recorded at the net present value of the fixed payment stream. On a cumulative historical basis, Honeywell has recorded insurance receivables equal to approximately 40 percent of the value of the underlying asbestos claims recorded. However, because there are gaps in our coverage due to insurance company insolvencies, certain uninsured periods, and insurance settlements, this rate is expected to decline for any future Bendix related asbestos liabilities that may be recorded. Future recoverability rates may also be impacted by numerous other factors, such as future insurance settlements, insolvencies and judicial determinations relevant to our coverage program, which are difficult to predict. Assuming continued defense and indemnity spending at current levels, we estimate that the cumulative recoverability rate could decline over the next five years to approximately 33 percent. Honeywell believes it has sufficient insurance coverage and reserves to cover all pending Bendix related asbestos claims and Bendix related asbestos claims estimated to be filed within the next five years. Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of either pending or future Bendix related asbestos claims, we do not believe that such claims would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position in light of our insurance coverage and our prior experience in resolving such claims. If the rate and types of claims filed, the average resolution value of such claims and the period of time over which claim settlements are paid (collectively, the Variable Claims Factors) do not substantially change, Honeywell would not expect future Bendix related asbestos claims to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in any fiscal year. No assurances can be given, however, that the Variable Claims Factors will not change. Other Matters We are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Included in these other matters are the following: Allen, et al. v. Honeywell Retirement Earnings Plan Pursuant to a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona in February 2008, 18 of 21 claims alleged by plaintiffs in this class action lawsuit were dismissed with prejudice in exchange for approximately $35 million (paid from the Companys pension plan) and the maximum aggregate liability for the remaining three claims (alleging that Honeywell impermissibly reduced the pension benefits of certain employees of a predecessor entity when the plan was amended in 1983 and failed to calculate benefits in accordance with the terms of the plan) was capped at $500 million. In October 2009, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Honeywell Retirement Earnings Plan with respect to the claim regarding the calculation of benefits. In May 2011, the parties engaged in mediation and reached an agreement in principle to settle the three remaining claims for $23.8 million (also to be paid from the Companys pension plan). Settlement documents have been submitted to the court for classwide approval. A preliminary settlement order has been approved by the court and a fairness hearing on the settlement is scheduled for April 2012. Upon court approval of the settlement, all claims in this matter will be fully resolved. Quick Lube On March 31, 2008, SE Quick Lube, a filter distributor, filed suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut alleging that twelve filter manufacturers, including Honeywell, engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices, rig bids and allocate U.S. customers for aftermarket automotive filters. This suit is a purported class action on behalf of direct purchasers of filters from the defendants. Parallel purported class actions, including on behalf of indirect purchasers of filters, have been filed by other plaintiffs in a variety of jurisdictions in the United States and Canada. The U.S cases have been consolidated into a single multi-district litigation in the Northern District of Illinois. In June 2011, plaintiffs principal witness pled guilty to a felony count of having made false statements to federal investigators. In February 2012, Honeywell reached an agreement in principle to resolve the multi-district litigation class action as to all plaintiffs, subject to finalization of the agreement and approval by the court. As previously reported, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice notified Honeywell in January 2010 that it had officially closed its investigation into possible collusion in the replacement auto filters industry. Honeywell v. United Auto Workers (UAW) et. al In July 2011, Honeywell filed an action in federal court (District of New Jersey) against the UAW and all former employees who retired under a series of Master Collective Bargaining Agreements (MCBAs) between Honeywell and the UAW. The Company is seeking a declaratory judgment that certain express limitations on its obligation to contribute toward the healthcare coverage of such retirees (the CAPS) set forth in the MCBAs may be implemented, effective January 1, 2012. In September 2011, the UAW and certain retiree defendants filed a motion to dismiss the New Jersey action and filed suit in the Eastern District of Michigan alleging that the MCBAs do not provide for CAPS on the Companys liability for healthcare coverage. The UAW and retiree plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for class certification and a motion for partial summary judgment in the Michigan action, seeking a ruling that retirees who retired prior to the initial inclusion of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA are not covered by the CAPS as a matter of law. In December 2011, the New Jersey action was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds. Honeywell has filed a motion for expedited review of the New Jersey courts dismissal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and the parties are awaiting the courts instructions with respect to how the Michigan action is to proceed. Honeywell is confident that the CAPS will be upheld and that its liability for healthcare coverage premiums with respect to the putative class will be limited as negotiated and expressly set forth in the applicable MCBAs. In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywells other postretirement benefits for pre-2003 retirees would increase by approximately $150 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS. Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations (including the specific matters referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters. Considering our past experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. Warranties and Guarantees We have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at December 31, 2011: ##TABLE_START   Maximum Potential Future Payments   Operating lease residual values  $    Other third parties financing      Unconsolidated affiliates financing      Customer financing            $        ##TABLE_END We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination, if any, existing on the date of disposition. Such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In the normal course of business we issue product warranties and product performance guarantees. We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale. Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties and guarantees are made as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable. The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded obligations for product warranties and product performance guarantees: ##TABLE_START   Years Ended December 31,           Beginning of year  $    $    $    Accruals for warranties/guarantees issued during the year              Adjustment of pre-existing warranties/guarantees    (2 )    (13 )    (7 )  Settlement of warranty/guarantee claims    (208 )    (193 )    (191 )              End of year  $    $    $                ##TABLE_END Product warranties and product performance guarantees are included in the following balance sheet accounts: ##TABLE_START       Accrued liabilities  $    $    Other liabilities                    $    $            ##TABLE_END 96 Note 22. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. Pension benefits for substantially all U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. U.S. defined benefit pension plans comprise 77 percent of our projected benefit obligation. Non-U.S. employees, who are not U.S. citizens, are covered by various retirement benefit arrangements, some of which are considered to be defined benefit pension plans for accounting purposes. Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans comprise 23 percent of our projected benefit obligation. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage to eligible retirees. Our retiree medical plans mainly cover U.S. employees who retire with pension eligibility for hospital, professional and other medical services. Most of the U.S. retiree medical plans require deductibles and copayments, and virtually all are integrated with Medicare. Retiree contributions are generally required based on coverage type, plan and Medicare eligibility. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell after January 1, 2000 are not eligible to participate in our retiree medical and life insurance plans. Only approximately 5 percent of Honeywells U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company; and this subsidy is limited to a fixed-dollar amount. In addition more than half of its current retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. In 2011, in connection with new collective bargaining agreements reached with several of its union groups, Honeywell amended its U.S. retiree medical plans eliminating the subsidy for those union employees resulting in curtailment gains totaling $167 million. The curtailment gains represent the recognition in net periodic postretirement benefit cost of prior service credits attributable to the future years of service of the union groups for which future accrual of benefits has been eliminated. In 2010, Honeywell amended its U.S. retiree medical plan to no longer offer certain post-age-65 retirees Honeywell group coverage and facilitate their purchase of an individual plan in the Medicare marketplace. This plan amendment reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $137 million which will be recognized as part of net periodic postretirement benefit cost over the average future service period to full eligibility of the remaining active union employees still eligible for a retiree medical subsidy. Also in 2010, in connection with a new collective bargaining agreement reached with one of its union groups, Honeywell amended its U.S. retiree medical plan eliminating the subsidy for those union employees who retire after February 1, 2013. This plan amendment reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $39 million which will be recognized as part of net periodic postretirement benefit cost over the average future service period to full eligibility of the remaining active union employees still eligible for a retiree medical subsidy. This plan amendment also resulted in a curtailment gain of $37 million in 2010 which represented the recognition in net periodic postretirement benefit cost of prior service credits attributable to the future years of service of the union group for which future accrual of benefits was eliminated. In 2009, Honeywell amended the U.S. retiree medical plan eliminating the subsidy for active non-union employees who retire after September 1, 2009. Employees already retired or who retired on or before September 1, 2009 were not affected by this change. This plan amendment reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $180 million representing the elimination of benefits attributable to years of service already rendered by active non-union employees who are not eligible to retire and those eligible non-union employees who were assumed not to retire prior to September 1, 2009. This reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation will be recognized as part of net periodic postretirement benefit cost over the average future service period to full eligibility of the remaining active union employees still eligible for a retiree medical subsidy. This plan amendment also resulted in a curtailment gain of $98 million in 2009 which represented the recognition in net periodic post retirement benefit cost of prior service credits attributable to the future years of service of the employee group for which future accrual of benefits was eliminated.

Major actuarial assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost for our significant benefit plans are presented in the following table. ##TABLE_START   Pension Benefits     U.S. Plans  Non-U.S. Plans                  Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31:                    Discount rate  4.89 %  5.25 %  5.75 %  4.84 %  5.40 %  5.71 %  Expected annual rate of compensation increase  4.50 %  4.50 %  4.50 %  3.67 %  3.79 %  3.87 %  Actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended December 31:                    Discount rate  5.25 %  5.75 %  6.95 %  5.40 %  5.71 %  6.21 %  Expected rate of return on plan assets  8.00 %  9.00 %  9.00 %  7.06 %  7.51 %  7.52 %  Expected annual rate of compensation increase  4.50 %  4.50 %  4.50 %  3.79 %  3.87 %  3.33 %  ##TABLE_END 101 ##TABLE_START   Other Postretirement Benefits           Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31:           Discount rate  4.00 %  4.70 %  5.25 %  Actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended December 31:           Discount rate  4.70 %  5.25 %  6.00 %  ##TABLE_END The discount rate for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefits plans reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be settled at the measurement date of December 31. To determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments. We use the average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations. Our expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 8 percent is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations on future market conditions and the asset mix of the plans investments. We review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. For non-U.S. benefit plans, none of which was individually material, assumptions reflect economic assumptions applicable to each country. Pension Benefits Included in the aggregate data in the tables above are the amounts applicable to our pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets. Amounts related to such plans were as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 31,     U.S. Plans  Non-U.S. Plans              Projected benefit obligation  $ 15,600   $ 14,990   $ 4,141   $ 1,990   Accumulated benefit obligation  $ 14,845   $ 14,260   $ 3,912   $ 1,883   Fair value of plan assets  $ 12,836   $ 12,181   $ 3,367   $ 1,474   ##TABLE_END Accumulated benefit obligation for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $14.8 and $14.3 billion and our Non-U.S. defined benefit plans were $4.4 and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our asset investment strategy for our U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve our long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. Our actual invested positions in various securities change over time based on short and longer-term investment opportunities. To achieve our objectives, we have established long-term target allocations as follows: 60-70 percent equity securities, 10-20 percent fixed income securities and cash, 5-15 percent real estate investments, and 10-20 percent other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located both inside and outside the United States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies. We review our assets on a regular basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations. Our non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing standard funding and investment guidance. Local regulations, local funding rules, and local financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. While our non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country, the long-term investment objectives are generally the same as those for the U.S. pension assets. The fair values of both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans assets at December 31, 2011 and 2010 by asset category are as follows: ##TABLE_START   U.S. Plans     December 31, 2011     Total  Level 1

 $   $   $            ##TABLE_END Our U.S. pension assets at December 31, 2011 and 2010 include $976 and $834 million, respectively, in notional derivative exposure primarily related to outstanding equity futures contracts. The Company enters into futures contracts to gain exposure to certain markets. Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgages, asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in commingled funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals. Our general funding policy for qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans, however, we made voluntary contributions of $1,650, $1,000 and $740 million, respectively, primarily to improve the funded status of our plans. These contributions do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets. In 2012, we expect to make cash contributions of $800 million to $1 billion ($250 million was made in January 2012) to our global defined benefit pension plans principally to improve the funded status of our plans and also to satisfy regulatory funding standards in our non-U.S. plans. Benefit payments, including amounts to be paid from Company assets, and reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows: ##TABLE_START   U.S. Plans  Non-U.S. Plans     $ 1,025  $    1,025      1,051      1,101      1,084    2017-2021   5,473   1,097  ##TABLE_END Other Postretirement Benefits The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) provides subsidies for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug coverage that is at least actuarially equivalent to that offered by Medicare Part D. The March 2010 enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including modifications made in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 resulted in a one-time, non-cash charge of $13 million related to income taxes in the first quarter of 2010. The charge results from a change in the tax treatment of the Medicare Part D program. ##TABLE_START   December 31,         Assumed health care cost trend rate:        Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year   7.50 %  8.00 % Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to   5.00 %  5.00 % Year that the rate reaches the rate it is assumed to remain at      ##TABLE_END The assumed health care cost trend rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported.

R eport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm T O THE B OARD OF D IRECTORS AND S HAREHOLDERS OF H ONEYWELL I NTERNATIONAL I NC .; In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Honeywell International Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and the financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey February 17, 2012 ##TABLE_START ", "9A": " I tem 9A.

Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Honeywell management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Honeywells internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Honeywells internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: ##TABLE_START  (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Honeywells assets;    (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Honeywells management and directors; and    (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Honeywells assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ##TABLE_END Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of Honeywells internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework . Based on this assessment, management determined that Honeywell maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. The effectiveness of Honeywells internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8.

The ultimate value of any growth plan award may be paid in cash or shares of Common Stock and, thus, growth plan units are not included in the table above. The ultimate value of growth plan units depends upon the achievement of pre-established performance goals during the two-year performance cycle. 50% of the payment related to these growth plan units will be paid in March 2012 and the remaining 50% will be paid in March 2013, subject to active employment on the payment dates.    Because the number of future shares that may be distributed to employees participating in the Honeywell Global Stock Plan is unknown, no shares attributable to that plan are included in column (a) of the table above.   (2) Column (b) relates to stock options and does not include any exercise price for RSUs, performance shares, or growth plan units granted to employees or non-employee directors under equity compensation plans approved by shareowners. RSUs do not have an exercise price because their value is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals or continued employment or service and they are settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. Growth plan units are denominated in cash units and the ultimate value of the award is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals.   (3) The number of shares that may be issued under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2011 is 39,582,132 which includes the following additional shares under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (or any Prior ##TABLE_END 115 ##TABLE_START  Plan as defined in the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan) that may again be available for issuance: shares that are settled for cash, expire, are canceled, are tendered in satisfaction of an option exercise price or tax withholding obligations, are reacquired with cash tendered in satisfaction of an option exercise price or with monies attributable to any tax deduction enjoyed by Honeywell to the exercise of an option, and are under any outstanding awards assumed under any equity compensation plan of an entity acquired by Honeywell. No securities are available for future issuance under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, the 1993 Stock Plan, or the 1994 Non-Employee Director Plan.    The number of shares that may be issued under the Honeywell Global Stock Plan as of December 31, 2011 is 2,384,352. This plan is an umbrella plan for four plans maintained solely for eligible employees of participating non-U.S. countries. More than 50% of the shares distributed under the Honeywell Global Stock Plan have been distributed to participants in one sub-plan, the Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of January 1, 2011, the Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan was suspended, although company matching shares awarded to participants in 2008 vested in November 2011.    Another sub-plan of the Honeywell Global Stock Plan, the UK Sharebuilder Plan, allows an eligible UK employee to contribute a specified percentage of taxable earnings that is then invested in shares. The company matches those shares and dividends paid are used to purchase additional shares. The company increased the match share percentage from 50% to 62.50% effective March 1, 2011. Matched shares are subject to a three-year vesting schedule. Shares taken out of the plan before five years lose their tax-favored status. For the year ending December 31, 2011, 105,015 shares were credited to participants accounts under the UK Sharebuilder Plan.    The remaining two sub-plans of the Honeywell Global Stock Plan, the Honeywell International Technologies Employees Share Ownership Plan (Ireland) and the Honeywell Measurex (Ireland) Limited Group Employee Profit Sharing Scheme, allow eligible Irish employees to contribute specified percentages of base pay, bonus or performance pay that are then invested in shares. Shares must be held in trust for at least two years and lose their tax-favored status if they are taken out of the plan before three years. For the year ending December 31, 2011, 23,881 shares were credited to participants accounts under these two plans.    The remaining 229,000 shares included in column (c) are shares remaining for future grants under the 2006 Non-Employee Director Plan.   (4) Equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners that are included in the table are the Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees of Honeywell International Inc. and its Subsidiaries, and the AlliedSignal Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Employees of AlliedSignal Inc. and its Subsidiaries.    The Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees of Honeywell International Inc. and its Subsidiaries is an unfunded, non-tax qualified plan that provides benefits equal to the employee deferrals and company matching allocations that would have been provided under Honeywells U.S. tax-qualified savings plan if the Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and contributions did not apply. The company matching contribution is credited to participants accounts in the form of notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of Common Stock when payments are made to participants under the plan. The number of shares to be issued under this plan based on the value of the notional shares as of December 31, 2011 is 592,957.    The AlliedSignal Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Employees of AlliedSignal Inc. and its Subsidiaries was a cash incentive compensation plan maintained by AlliedSignal Inc. This plan has expired. Employees were permitted to defer receipt of a cash bonus payable under the plan and invest the deferred bonus in notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of Common Stock when payments are made to participants under the plan. No further deferrals can be made under this plan. The number of shares of Common Stock that remain to be issued under this expired plan as of December 31, 2011 is 33,911.    The Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. provides for mandatory and elective deferral of certain payments to non-employee directors. Mandatory deferrals are invested in notional shares of Common Stock. Directors may also invest any elective deferrals in notional shares of Common Stock. Because the notional shares are distributed in the form of cash when payments are made to directors under the plan, they are not included in the table above. ##TABLE_END 116 ##TABLE_START (5) Column (b) does not include any exercise price for notional shares allocated to employees under Honeywells equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners because all of these shares are notionally allocated as a matching contribution under the non-tax qualified savings plans or as a notional investment of deferred bonuses or fees under the cash incentive compensation and directors plans as described in note 4 and are only settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis.   (6) No securities are available for future issuance under the AlliedSignal Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Employees of AlliedSignal Inc. and its Subsidiaries and the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. The cash incentive compensation plan has expired. All notional investments in shares of Common Stock are converted to cash when payments are made under the directors plan. The amount of securities available for future issuance under the Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees of Honeywell International Inc. and its Subsidiaries is not determinable because the number of securities that may be issued under this plan depends upon the amount deferred to the plan by participants in future years.    The table does not contain information for employee benefit plans of Honeywell that are intended to meet the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and a small number of foreign employee benefit plans that are similar to such Section 401(a) plans. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ", "13": " I tem 13.

Our sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers were 7, 6, and 6 percent of our total sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 12, 11, and 11 percent of our total sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010. Our Aerospace results of operations can be impacted by various industry and economic conditions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. U.S. Government Sales Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by our Aerospace segment), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $4,109, $4,276 and $4,354 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a prime contractor and subcontractor, of $3,273, $3,374 and $3,500 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Base U.S. defense spending (excludes Overseas Contingent Operations) was essentially flat in 2012 compared to 2011 (see Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). Due to anticipated lower U.S. Government spending levels mandated by the Budget Control Act (sequestration), we expect a slight decline in our defense and space revenue in 2013. We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2013 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEM production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs), increases in direct foreign defense and space market sales, as well as our diversified commercial businesses. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to audits, investigations, and termination by the government. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. Backlog Our total backlog at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $16,807 and $16,160 million, respectively. We anticipate that approximately $12,102 million of the 2012 backlog will be filled in 2013. We believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option. Competition We are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas. Competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions. Competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us, and vary by country. Our businesses compete on a variety of factors, such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. A number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies, some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers. See Item 1A Risk Factors for further discussion. International Operations We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development globally. U.S. exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 14, 12 and 11 percent of our total sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Foreign manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 41, 43 and 42 percent of our total sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Approximately 20 percent of total 2012 sales of Aerospace-related products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products and systems and performance of services such as aircraft repair and overhaul. Exports were principally made to Europe, Canada, Asia and Latin America. Foreign manufactured products and systems and performance of services comprised approximately 16 percent of total 2012 Aerospace sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Canada and Asia. Approximately 3 percent of total 2012 sales of Automation and Control Solutions products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Foreign manufactured products and performance of services accounted for 57 percent of total 2012 Automation and Control Solutions sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe and Asia, with less significant operations in Canada and Australia. Approximately 35 percent of total 2012 sales of Performance Materials and Technologies products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Exports were principally made to Asia and Latin America. Foreign manufactured products and performance of services comprised 22 percent of total 2012 Performance Materials and Technologies sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Asia. Approximately 3 percent of total 2012 sales of Transportation Systems products were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Foreign manufactured products accounted for 83 percent of total 2012 sales of Transportation Systems. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Asia and Australia. The Company and its subsidiaries have a current policy not to conduct business with Iran. Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we note the following. In 2009, Honeywell acquired RMG Group (RMG), a German company that had a pre-existing contract with an Iranian entity for the supply and installation of compressed natural gas refueling stations in Iran. The RMG contract was entered into and performed by a foreign entity and did not involve the development of natural gas resources or pipelines, and we believe that it was not prohibited by or sanctionable under applicable laws. In July 2011, RMG assigned performance under the contract to an unaffiliated Italian company. During the first quarter of 2012, the unaffiliated Italian company performed some services under the contract. However, since the Iranian customer failed to make required payments, the unaffiliated Italian company has performed no work under the assigned contract since the first quarter of 2012. The Company does not intend to perform any further services under this contract, in accordance with Company policy and applicable laws. No gross revenues or net profits have been received by the Company under this contract from Iran in 2012. Additionally, a non-U.S. affiliate of Honeywell received $1,120,000 (representing net profit of $400,000 recognized in a prior period) during 2012 for services performed and / or goods delivered in or prior to the first quarter of 2011 in connection with automation engineering services contracts entered into in 2009 involving Iran. These contracts were also entered into and performed by non-US entities, and we believe that the contracts and their performance were not prohibited by or sanctionable under laws applicable at the time. Honeywells Italian affiliate transferred its remaining obligations to an unaffiliated company based in Dubai in the fourth quarter of 2010. Honeywell has not performed any services or provided any materials under these contracts after the first quarter of 2011, and it does not intend to provide any further services or materials under these contracts, in accordance with Company policy and applicable laws. OFAC issued a General License in 31 CFR  560.555 valid from October 9, 2012 to March 8, 2013, which permits transactions ordinarily incident to the wind-down of operations involving Iran by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies. Honeywells non-U.S. affiliate in Italy received payments of $187,000 (out of a total of $1,120,000 received in 2012) during the validity period of the General License. To Honeywells knowledge, neither it nor any of its affiliates engaged in any other activity during 2012 required to be disclosed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Financial information including net sales and long-lived assets related to geographic areas is included in Note 25 of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Information regarding the economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international operations is included in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Raw Materials The principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available. Although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply, we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials and commodities in 2012. We are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials, except related to R240 (a key component in foam blowing agents), a raw material used in our Performance Materials and Technologies segment. The costs of certain key raw materials, including cumene, fluorspar, perchloroethylene, R240, natural gas, sulfur and ethylene in our Performance Materials and Technologies business, nickel, steel and other metals in our Transportation Systems business, and nickel, titanium and other metals in our Aerospace business, are expected to continue to fluctuate. We will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2013. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion. Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. We own, or are licensed under, a large number of patents, patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years, which relate to many of our products or improvements to those products and which are of importance to our business. From time to time, new patents and trademarks are obtained, and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others. We also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and services produced by other companies. In our judgment, those rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any patent, trademark or related group of patents, or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product, to be of material importance in relation to our total business. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion. We have registered trademarks for a number of our products and services, including Honeywell, Aclar, Ademco, Bendix, BW, Callidus, Enovate, Esser, Fire-Lite, Garrett, Genetron, Gent, Howard Leight, Jurid, Matrikon, Maxon, MK, North, Notifier, Novar, RMG, Silent Knight, Solstice, Spectra, System Sensor, Trend, Tridium and UOP. Research and Development Our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of new products, technologies and processes, and the development of new uses for existing products and software applications. The Companys principal research and development activities are in the U.S., India, Europe and China. Research and development (RD) expense totaled $1,847, $1,799 and $1,450 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in RD expense of 3 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 was mainly due to increased expenditures on the development of new technologies to support existing and new aircraft platforms in our Aerospace segment and new product development in our Automation and Control Solutions and Performance Materials Technologies segments. The increase in RD expense of 24 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 was mainly due to increased expenditures on the development of new technologies to support existing and new aircraft platforms in our Aerospace segment, the development of turbocharging systems for new diesel and gas applications in our Transportation Systems segment and new product development in our Automation and Control Solutions segment. RD as a percentage of sales was 4.9, 4.9 and 4.5 percent in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Customer-sponsored (principally the U.S. Government) RD activities amounted to an additional $835, $867 and $874 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Environment We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. It is our policy to comply with these requirements, and we believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys Superfund priority list. Although, under some court interpretations of these laws, there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, to date we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole. We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Companys business or markets that it serves, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. Further information, including the current status of significant environmental matters and the financial impact incurred for remediation of such environmental matters, if any, is included in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Employees We have approximately 132,000 employees at December 31, 2012, of which approximately 52,000 were located in the United States. ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements We have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including the overview of the Company and each of our segments and the discussion of their respective economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2013. These sections and other parts of this report (including this Item 1A) contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. Risk Factors Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations. The operating results of our segments are impacted by general global industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns, demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing and shipping costs. The operating results of our Aerospace segment, which generated 32 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2012, are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production, the deferral or cancellation of orders for new aircraft, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft platforms, the retirement of aircraft, global flying hours, and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates, as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts, supplier consolidation, factory transitions, capacity constraints, and the level and mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs (as further discussed in other risk factors below). The challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including global flying hours, aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline consolidation, airline insolvencies, terrorism and safety concerns as well as changes in regulations. Future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our Aerospace aftermarket sales and margins. The operating results of our Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) segment, which generated 42 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2012, are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation, industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion, inventory levels in distribution channels, and global economic growth rates. Performance Materials and Technologies operating results, which generated 16 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2012, are impacted by global economic growth rates, capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, and raw material demand and supply volatility. Transportation Systems operating results, which generated 10 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2012, are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, and regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, delays in launch schedules for new automotive platforms, and consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products. Demand of global automotive and truck manufacturers will continue to be influenced by a wide variety of factors, including ability of consumers to obtain financing, ability to reduce operating costs and overall consumer and business confidence. Each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices (as further described below) and non- material inflation. Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities. The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in our Performance Materials and Technologies (cumene, fluorspar, perchloroethylene, R240, natural gas, sulfur and ethylene), Transportation Systems (nickel, steel and other metals) and Aerospace (nickel, titanium and other metals) segments. Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations. Our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials (including raw materials) by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components, and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions, quality standards, and applicable laws and regulations. In addition, many major components, product equipment items and raw materials are procured or subcontracted on a single-source basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies; in some circumstances these suppliers are the sole source of the component or equipment. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their non-performance. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by suppliers decisions to exit certain businesses, bankruptcy and by external events such as natural disasters, extreme weather events, pandemic health issues, terrorist actions, labor disputes, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes (e.g., product certification or stewardship requirements, sourcing restrictions, product authenticity, climate change or greenhouse gas emission standards, etc.). Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. Transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays, including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/or regulatory agencies. In addition, because our businesses cannot always immediately adapt their cost structure to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity for certain products may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements, which could adversely impact our operating costs, profitability and customer and supplier relationships. Our facilities, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to, among other things, fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, result in personal injury or property damage, damage relationships with our customers and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities or systems, as well as result in other liabilities and adverse impacts. The same risk could also arise from the failure of critical systems supplied by Honeywell to large industrial, refining and petrochemical customers. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins. Our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) develop and retain individuals with the requisite expertise. Our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources. These development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts. We own or are licensed under a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications, trademarks and copyrights. Our intellectual property rights may expire or be challenged, invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms. In some non-U.S. countries, laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application, which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights. Any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs, and/or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company and/or its third party service providers. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. Although we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations. Our international operations, including U.S. exports, comprise a growing proportion of our operating results. Our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets, including developing markets such as China, India, the Middle East and other high growth regions. In 2012, approximately 55 percent of our total sales (including products manufactured in the U.S. and sold outside the U.S. as well as products manufactured in international locations) were outside of the U.S. including approximately 28 percent in Europe and approximately 13 percent in Asia. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, government instability, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. We are also subject to U.S. laws prohibiting companies from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the type of business that may be conducted in these countries. The cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. Uncertain global economic conditions arising from circumstances such as sovereign debt issues, slowing growth in emerging regions and credit rating downgrades in certain European countries or speculation regarding changes to the composition or viability of the Euro zone could result in reduced customer confidence resulting in decreased demand for our products and services, disruption in payment patterns and higher default rates, a tightening of credit markets (see risk factor below regarding volatility of credit markets for further discussion), increased risk regarding supplier performance, increased counterparty risk with respect to the financial institutions with which we do business, and exchange rate fluctuations. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the financial institutions with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the US dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the US dollar and may adversely affect our results of operations. Currency fluctuations may affect product demand and prices we pay for materials, as a result, our operating margins may be negatively impacted. Fluctuations in exchange rates may give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of our non-U.S. businesses are translated into U.S. dollars. While we monitor our exchange rate exposures and seek to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities, such activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or successful in significantly mitigating such volatility. Volatility of credit markets or macro-economic factors could adversely affect our business. Changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate volatility, may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. A decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing. Delays in our customers ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing to our customers, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. The inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could result in the need to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant incremental cost and delay, as discussed above. Lastly, disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets could impact the financial institutions with which we do business. We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our long-lived assets or available for sale investments. At December 31, 2012, the net carrying value of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) and available for sale securities totaled approximately $19.9 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other long-lived assets. An other than temporary decline in the market value of our available for sale securities may also result in an impairment charge. Future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareowners equity and increase our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, which could negatively impact our credit rating and access to the public debt and equity markets. A change in the level of U.S. Government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact Aerospaces defense and space sales and results of operations. Sales of our defense and space-related products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets, particularly the U.S. defense budget. Sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. Department of Defense comprised approximately 27 and 9 percent of Aerospace and total sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2012. We cannot predict the extent to which total funding and/or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the 2013 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by Congress, or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations. We also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning and/or the nature of war-related activity on existing, follow-on or replacement programs. A shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate and/or reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations. As a supplier of military and other equipment to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unusual risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance. In addition to normal business risks, companies like Honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the U.S. Government are subject to unusual risks, including dependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds, changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments, significant changes in contract requirements, complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete, necessity for frequent design improvements, intense competition for U.S. Government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development, difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work, and other factors characteristic of the industry, such as contract award protests and delays in the timing of contract approvals. Changes are customary over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly development contracts, and generally result in adjustments to contract prices and schedules. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to various government audits. Like many other government contractors, we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts or changes to certain accounting systems or controls to comply with various government regulations. When appropriate and prudent, we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, plus termination costs and a reasonable profit. If a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for reprocurement costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and for other damages suffered by the government as permitted under the contract. We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. The U.S. Government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other egregious misconduct. Debarment generally does not exceed three years. Our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees, vendors, agents or business partners. We cannot ensure that our extensive compliance controls, policies and procedures will, in all instances, protect us from reckless, unethical or criminal acts committed by our employees, vendors, agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including laws governing payments to government officials, competition, data privacy and rights of employees. Any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, results of operations and reputation. Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations. Safety and performance regulations (including mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft), product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact Aerospace sales, research and development expenditures, operating costs and profitability. The demand for and cost of providing Automation and Control Solutions products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies results of operations can be affected by environmental (e.g. government regulation of fluorocarbons), safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations, while emissions, fuel economy and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our Transportation Systems segment. Honeywell sells products that address safety and environmental regulation and a substantial portion of our portfolio is dedicated to energy efficient products and services. Legislation or regulations regarding areas such as labor and employment, employee benefit plans, tax, health, safety and environmental matters, import, export and trade, intellectual property, product certification, and product liability may impact the results of each of our operating segments and our consolidated results. Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned, and divestitures may not occur as planned. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, (ii) the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities, (iii) the failure to integrate acquired businesses into Honeywell on schedule and/or to achieve synergies in the planned amount or within the expected timeframe, (iv) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected timeframe, and (v) the degree of protection provided by indemnities from sellers of acquired companies and the obligations under indemnities provided to purchasers of our divested businesses. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, import and export matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings. Moreover, our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. It also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition. Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We have incurred remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our expenses include significant costs related to employee and retiree health benefits. With approximately 132,000 employees, including approximately 52,000 in the U.S., our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health benefits are significant. In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs, largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control, in particular, ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation. Continued increasing health-care costs, legislative or regulatory changes, and volatility in discount rates, as well as changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health benefit expenses, may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and pension contributions in future periods. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. Funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans may become more significant. However, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. For a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to estimate pension expense, including discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies included in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. In 2012, our tax expense represented 24.4 percent of our income before tax, and includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company, that could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. ", "1B": " Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. ", "2": " Item 2. Properties We have approximately 1,300 locations consisting of plants, research laboratories, sales offices and other facilities. Our headquarters and administrative complex is located in Morris Township, New Jersey. Our plants are generally located to serve large marketing areas and to provide accessibility to raw materials and labor pools. Our properties are generally maintained in good operating condition. Utilization of these plants may vary with sales to customers and other business conditions; however, no major operating facility is significantly idle. We own or lease warehouses, railroad cars, barges, automobiles, trucks, airplanes and materials handling and data processing equipment. We also lease space for administrative and sales staffs.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY For Honeywell, 2012 marked another year of strong growth despite a challenging political and macro-economic environment. The Company continued to manage uncertainty associated with slower than expected economic growth in the United States, recession in the European Union, political unrest in the Middle East, and slowing growth in China and other emerging economies. Despite a modest 2.6 percent growth in World GDP and Industrial Production, Honeywells 2012 revenues were $37.7 billion representing a 3 percent improvement compared to 2011 revenues of $36.5 billion. Honeywells 2012 revenue growth was achieved despite significant foreign exchange weakness in the Euro and other non-U.S. dollar currencies which had a negative 2 percent impact on our 2012 revenues. Our segment profit improved by 10 percent, in excess of three times revenue growth, evidencing the Companys continued focus on operational excellence. See Review of Business Segments section of this MDA for a reconciliation of segment profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before taxes. The Companys operational excellence and ability to expand profit faster than sales growth is due in part to a consistent, methodical application of several key internal business processes which drive efficiency and service quality, bringing world-class products and services to markets faster and more cost effectively for our customers. Honeywell refers to these processes as the Honeywell Enablers. In 2012, Honeywell continued to strengthen and expand the use of the Honeywell Enablers: ##TABLE_START    The Honeywell Operating System (HOS): HOS drives sustainable improvements in our manufacturing operations to generate exceptional performance in safety, quality, delivery, cost, and inventory management. Approximately 70 percent of our manufacturing cost base has achieved HOS certification.     Velocity Product Development (VPD): VPD is a process which brings together all of the functions necessary to successfully launch new productsRD, manufacturing, marketing and salesto increase the probability that in commercializing new technologies Honeywell delivers the right products at the right price.     Functional Transformation (FT): Functional Transformation is HOS for our administrative functionsFinance, Legal, HR, IT and Purchasingstandardizing the way we work, which improves service quality and reduces costs.     Organizational Efficiency (OEF): OEF is, in its simplest form, the cost of labor. Improvements in OEF represent the success of Honeywells initiatives to increase labor cost efficiency and employee productivity. ##TABLE_END The Company continues to invest for future growth as measured by a number of important metrics: ##TABLE_START    RD spending at 4.9 percent of revenues was targeted at such high growth areas as natural gas processing, low global warming refrigerants and blowing agents, and wireless control devices and technologies. ##TABLE_END 25 ##TABLE_START     Capital expenditures grew 11 percent to $884 million including the construction or expansion of technology centers in India and Saudi Arabia.     The Company recognized approximately $119 million of restructuring actions to support sustainable productivity in years to come.     The Company completed $438 million (net of cash acquired) in acquisitions in 2012, including acquisition of a 70 percent ownership interest in Thomas Russell L.L.C. (Thomas Russell Co.), a leader in technology and equipment for natural gas processing and treating, primarily serving the US market.     Expansion of Honeywells presence and sales in high growth regions and countries such as China, India, Eastern Europe, the Middle-East, and Latin America. Sales to customers outside the United States now account for approximately 55 percent of total revenues. ##TABLE_END Operating cash flow grew by 24 percent in 2012 to $3,517 million. This operating cash flow performance enabled us to invest $884 million in capital expenditures, fund the acquisitions discussed above, make $1,039 million in pension contributions, and provide an 11 percent increase in dividends paid (vs. 2011) and repurchase 5 million shares of common stock.

Gross margin percentage increased by 3.1 percentage points in 2012 compared with 2011 principally due to lower pension expense (approximately 2.2 percentage point impact primarily driven by the decrease in the pension mark-to-market adjustment allocated to cost of products and services sold), lower repositioning actions (approximately 0.6 percentage point impact) and higher segment gross margin in our Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions and Performance Materials and Technologies segments (approximately 0.4 percentage point impact collectively), partially offset by higher other postretirement expense (approximately 0.4 percentage point impact). Cost of products and services sold increased by $3,835 million or 16 percent in 2011 compared with 2010, principally due to an estimated increase in direct material costs, labor costs and indirect costs of approximately $2 billion, $520 million, and $280 million, respectively, driven substantially by a 13 percent increase in sales as a result of the factors (excluding price) shown above and discussed in the Review of Business Segments section of this MDA, an increase in pension and other postretirement expense of approximately $880 million (primarily driven by the increase in the pension mark-to-market adjustment allocated to cost of products and services sold of $1.1 billion) and an increase in repositioning and other charges of approximately $90 million. Gross margin percentage decreased by 1.8 percentage points in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to higher pension and other postretirement expense (approximate 2.8 percentage point impact primarily driven by an unfavorable 3.3 percentage point impact resulting from the increase in the pension mark-to-market adjustment allocated to cost of products and services sold) and repositioning and other charges (approximate 0.2 percentage point impact), partially offset by higher sales volume driven by each of our business segments (approximate 1.2 percentage point impact).

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales by 0.5 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 driven by an estimated $430 million increase in labor costs resulting from acquisitions, investment for growth, and merit increases, an estimated increase of $240 million in pension and other postretirement expense (driven primarily by the allocated portion of the pension mark-to-market charge increase of approximately $270 million) and an estimated increase of $60 million in repositioning actions, partially offset by the impact of higher sales volume as a result of the factors discussed in the Review of Business Segments section of this MDA.

Other income decreased by $13 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to a $29 million loss resulting from early redemption of debt in the first quarter of 2011, included within Other, net, and the absence of a $62 million pre-tax gain related to the consolidation of a joint venture within our Performance Materials and Technologies segment in the third quarter of 2010, included within Other, net, (see Note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements for further details), partially offset by a $61 million increase in gain on sale of non-strategic businesses and assets due primarily to a $50 million pre-tax gain related to the divestiture of the automotive on-board sensors products business within our Automation and Control Solutions segment and the reduction of approximately $12 million of acquisition related costs compared to 2010 included within Other, net. Interest and Other Financial Charges ##TABLE_START          2012  2011  2010 Interest and other financial charges  $    $    $   % change compared with prior period  (7)%  (3)%   ##TABLE_END Interest and other financial charges decreased by 7% percent in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to lower borrowing costs, partially offset by higher average debt balances. Interest and other financial charges decreased by 3% percent in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to lower borrowing costs, partially offset by higher debt balances. Tax Expense ##TABLE_START          2012  2011  2010 Tax expense  $    $    $   Effective tax rate   24.4 %    18.3 %    28.1 %  ##TABLE_END The effective tax rate increased by 6.1 percentage points in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings taxed at higher rates (primarily driven by an approximate 6.1 percentage point impact from the decrease in pension mark-to-market expense), a decreased benefit from valuation allowances, a decreased benefit from the settlement of tax audits and the absence of the U.S. RD tax credit, partially offset by a decreased expense related to tax reserves. The foreign effective tax rate was 17.0 percent, a decrease of approximately 4.1 percentage points which primarily consisted of a 10.0 percent impact related to a decrease in tax reserves, partially offset by a 5.2 percent impact from increased valuation allowances on net operating losses primarily due to a decrease in Luxembourg and France earnings available to be offset by net operating loss carry forwards and a 1.4 percent impact from tax expense related to foreign exchange. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign rates. The effective tax rate decreased by 9.8 percentage points in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign sources related to higher U.S. pension expense (primarily driven by an approximate 7.6 percentage point impact which resulted from the increase in pension mark-to-market expense), an increased benefit from manufacturing incentives, an increased benefit from the favorable settlement of tax audits and an increased benefit from a lower foreign effective tax rate. The foreign effective tax rate was 21.1 percent, a decrease of approximately 4.9 percentage points which primarily consisted of (i) a 5.1 percent impact from decreased valuation allowances on net operating losses primarily due to an increase in German earnings available to be offset by net operating loss carry forwards, (ii) a 2.4 percent impact from tax benefits related to foreign exchange and investment losses, (iii) a 1.2 percent impact from an increased benefit in tax credits and lower statutory tax rates, and (iv) a 4.1 percent impact related to an increase in tax reserves. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign rates. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law on January 2, 2013. Some of these provisions provide retroactive changes to the 2012 tax year which were not taken into account in determining the Companys effective tax rate for 2012. The impact of these retroactive changes will be recorded in the first quarter of 2013, however, the 2013 effective tax rate could also change based upon the Companys operating results, mix of earnings and the outcome of tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns currently under audit by various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities, several of which may be finalized in the foreseeable future. The Company believes that it has adequate reserves for these matters. However, the ultimate outcome of these matters may differ and could materially impact the results of operations and operating cash flows in the period they are resolved.

Economic and Other Factors Performance Materials and Technologies operating results are principally impacted by: ##TABLE_START    Level and timing of capital spending and capacity and utilization rates in refining and petrochemical end markets;     Pricing volatility and industry supply conditions for raw materials such as cumene, fluorspar, perchloroethylene, R240, natural gas, sulfur and ethylene;     Impact of environmental and energy efficiency regulations;     Global supply conditions and demand for non-ozone depleting, low global warming refrigerants and blowing agents;     Global supply conditions and demand for caprolactam, nylon resin and ammonium sulfate;     Condition of the U.S. residential housing and non-residential industries and automotive demand;     Extent of change in order rates from global semiconductor customers; and     Demand for new products including renewable energy and biofuels, low global warming products for insulation and refrigeration, additives, and enhanced nylon resin. ##TABLE_END Performance Materials and Technologies ##TABLE_START              2012  2011  Change  2010  Change Net sales  $  6,184   $  5,659    9 %   $  4,726    20 %  Cost of products and services sold   4,543    4,151      3,554    Selling, general and administrative expenses   439    420      345    Other   48    46      78               Segment profit  $  1,154   $  1,042    11 %   $     39 %             ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START          Factors Contributing to Year-Over-Year Change  2012 vs. 2011  2011 vs. 2010  Sales  Segment Profit  Sales  Segment Profit Organic growth/ Operational segment profit   4 %    9 %    16 %    38 %  Foreign exchange   (1 )%    (1 )%    1 %    1 %  Acquisitions and divestitures, net   6 %    3 %    3 %               Total % Change    9 %     11 %     20 %     39 %           ##TABLE_END 2012 compared with 2011 PMT sales increased by 9 percent in 2012 compared with 2011 due to a 6 percent growth from acquisitions and 4 percent increase in organic growth, partially offset by 1 percent unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. ##TABLE_START    UOP sales increased by 17 percent (12 percent organic) in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily driven by (i) increased equipment and licensing revenues and higher volume of petrochemical and refining catalysts in the first nine months, reflecting continued strength in the refining and petrochemical industries, and (ii) the favorable impact from acquisitions, partially offset by lower service revenue related to scheduled project completions.     Advanced Materials sales increased by 5 percent (flat organic) in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily driven by an increase in Resins and Chemicals sales, primarily due to the phenol plant acquisition; offset by lower sales in Fluorine Products primarily due to unfavorable pricing reflecting more challenging global end market conditions and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. We expect challenging global end market conditions to continue in the first quarter of 2013. ##TABLE_END PMT segment profit increased by 11 percent in 2012 compared with 2011 due to a 9 percent increase in operational segment profit (net of a 10 percent decrease in the fourth quarter due to the factors described below) and a 3 percent increase from acquisitions partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 1 percent in foreign exchange. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily due to higher licensing, catalyst and equipment revenues in UOP and productivity (net of continued investment in growth initiatives) partially offset by unfavorable pricing in Fluorine Products and Resins and Chemicals reflecting more challenging global end market conditions. Cost of products and services sold totaled $4.5 billion in 2012, an increase of $392 million which is primarily due to acquisitions, higher volume and continued investment in growth initiatives partially offset by productivity and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. In July 2012, the Company announced that it is evaluating a series of upgrades to its Metropolis Works nuclear conversion facility, a Fluorine Products facility, following a U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) inspection that focused on preparedness for extreme natural disasters such as strong earthquakes and tornados. The NRC inspection was part of a comprehensive assessment of all U.S. nuclear-related facilities following the Fukushima, Japan earthquake in 2011. Production at the Metropolis facility was suspended following the NRC inspection and will not resume until certain seismic-related upgrades have been implemented by the Company and reviewed by the NRC. The scope of these upgrades has been defined in a Confirmatory Order issued by the NRC to Honeywell on October 16, 2012. The Company believes that completion of the upgrades to the facility could be completed by the third quarter of 2013. The continued suspension of operations and the cost of the plant upgrades are not expected to have a material negative impact on Performance Materials and Technologies 2013 results of operations. 2011 compared with 2010 PMT sales increased by 20 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 due to a 16 percent increase in organic growth, 3 percent growth from acquisitions, and a 1 percent favorable impact of foreign exchange. ##TABLE_START    UOP sales increased by 24 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily driven by increased service, and licensing revenues and higher unit sales of refining and specialty catalysts, primarily reflecting continued strength in the refining and petrochemical industries.     Advanced Materials sales increased by 18 percent (12 percent organically) in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily driven by (i) a 33 percent (18 percent organically) increase in Resins and Chemicals sales primarily due to higher prices driven by strong Asia demand, agricultural demand, formula pricing arrangements and increased sales resulting from the acquisition of a phenol plant, partially offset by decreased volumes primarily due to disruptions in phenol supply and weather related events, (ii) a 10 percent increase in our Fluorine Products business due to higher pricing reflecting robust global demand and tight industry supply conditions primarily in the first half of the year, which moderated in the second half of the year due to seasonally weaker demand and increased available capacity in the marketplace, and (iii) a 12 percent increase in Specialty Products sales primarily due to higher sales volume in our armor, additives, and healthcare packaging products, and commercial excellence initiatives. We expect Advanced Materials sales growth to continue to moderate during the first half of 2012 due to ##TABLE_END 39 ##TABLE_START    slowing global demand and lower prices resulting from increased availability of refrigerants supply. ##TABLE_END PMT segment profit increased by 39 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 due to a 38 percent increase in operational segment profit and a 1 percent favorable impact of foreign exchange. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily due to the favorable price to raw materials spread in Resins and Chemicals and Fluorine Products and higher service, product and licensing revenues in UOP, partially offset by continued investment in growth and plant optimization initiatives. Cost of products and services sold totaled $4.2 billion in 2011, an increase of approximately $597 million which is primarily due to volume, material inflation, the phenol plant acquisition and continued investment in growth initiatives. 2013 Areas of Focus Performance Materials and Technologies primary areas of focus for 2013 include: ##TABLE_START    Continuing to develop new processes, products and technologies that address energy efficiency, the environment and security, as well as position the portfolio for higher value;     Commercializing new products and technologies in the petrochemical, gas processing and refining industries and renewable energy sector;     Investing to increase plant capacity and reliability to service backlog and improve productivity and quality through operational excellence;     Driving sales and marketing excellence and expanding local presence in high growth regions;     Managing exposure to raw material price and supply fluctuations through evaluation of alternative sources of supply and contractual arrangements; and     Managing the successful integration of acquisitions related to our gas processing and hydrogen business unit including capacity and geographic expansion to address rapidly growing commercial opportunities and existing backlog. ##TABLE_END Transportation Systems Overview Transportation Systems provides automotive products that improve the performance and efficiency of cars, trucks, and other vehicles through state-of-the-art technologies, world class brands and global solutions to customers needs. Transportation Systems products include turbochargers and thermal systems; and friction materials (Bendix(R) and Jurid(R)) and brake hard parts. Transportation Systems sells its products to original equipment (OE) automotive and truck manufacturers (e.g., BMW, Caterpillar, Daimler, Renault, Ford, and Volkswagen), wholesalers and distributors and through the retail aftermarket. Economic and Other Factors Transportation Systems operating results are principally impacted by: ##TABLE_START    Financial strength and stability of automotive OE manufacturers;     Global demand, particularly in Western Europe, for automobile and truck production;     Turbo penetration rates for new engine platforms;     Global consumer preferences, particularly in Western Europe, for boosted diesel passenger cars;     Degree of volatility in raw material prices, including nickel and steel;     New automobile production rates and the impact of inventory levels of automotive OE manufacturers on demand for our products;     Regulations mandating lower emissions and improved fuel economy; ##TABLE_END 40 ##TABLE_START     Consumers ability to obtain financing for new vehicle purchases; and     Impact of factors such as consumer confidence on automotive aftermarket demand. ##TABLE_END Transportation systems ##TABLE_START              2012  2011  Change  2010  Change Net sales  $  3,561   $  3,859    (8 )%   $  3,192    21 %  Cost of products and services sold   2,939    3,174      2,641    Selling, general and administrative expenses   159    161      149    Other   31    39      49               Segment profit  $    $     (11 )%   $     37 %             ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START          Factors Contributing to Year-Over-Year Change  2012 vs. 2011  2011 vs. 2010  Sales  Segment Profit  Sales  Segment Profit Organic growth/ Operational segment profit   (3 )%    (4 )%    16 %    32 %  Foreign exchange   (5 )%    (7 )%    5 %    5 %           Total % Change    (8 )%     (11 )%     21 %     37 %           ##TABLE_END 2012 compared with 2011 Transportation Systems sales decreased by 8 percent in 2012 compared with the 2011 primarily due to an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of 5 percent and a decrease in organic sales of 3 percent. Lower sales were primarily driven by decreased light vehicle production in Europe and lower aftermarket sales partially offset by new platform launches, including higher turbo gas penetration in North America. Transportation Systems segment profit decreased by 11 percent in 2012 compared with 2011 due to a 7 percent unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and a 4 percent decrease in operational segment profit. The decrease in operational segment profit is primarily due to decreased volume and unfavorable pricing, substantially offset by productivity (net of the impact of ongoing projects to drive operational improvement in the Friction Materials business), net of inflation. Cost of products and services sold totaled $2.9 billion in 2012, a decrease of $235 million which is primarily a result of foreign exchange, decreased volume and increased productivity. 2011 compared with 2010 Transportation Systems sales increased by 21 percent in 2011 compared with the 2010, primarily due to a 16 percent increase in organic revenue driven by increased sales volume and a favorable impact from foreign exchange of 5 percent. The sales increase in 2011 as compared with 2010 was primarily driven by (i) increased turbocharger sales to both light vehicle and commercial vehicle engine manufacturers primarily due to new platform launches and strong diesel penetration rates in Western Europe and (ii) the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Transportation Systems segment profit increased by 37 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 due to a 32 percent increase in operational segment profit and a 5 percent favorable impact from foreign exchange. The increase in operational segment profit is comprised of an approximate 25 percent positive impact from productivity, net of inflation and price, and 7 percent positive impact from higher sales volumes. Cost of products and services sold totaled $3.2 billion in 2011, an increase of $533 million which is primarily a result of higher sales volume, foreign exchange and inflation, partially offset by positive impact from productivity. 2013 Areas of Focus Transportation Systems primary areas of focus in 2013 include: ##TABLE_START    Sustaining superior turbocharger technology through successful platform launches; ##TABLE_END 41 ##TABLE_START     Maintaining the high quality of current products while executing new product introductions;     Increasing global penetration and share of diesel and gasoline turbocharger OEM demand;     Reducing manufacturing costs through increasing plant productivity and an improving global manufacturing footprint;     Aligning cost structure with current economic outlook, and successful execution of repositioning actions; and     Aligning development efforts and costs with new turbo platform launch schedules. ##TABLE_END Repositioning and Other Charges See Note 3 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to the Financial Statements for a discussion of repositioning and other charges incurred in 2012, 2011, and 2010. Our repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of approximately $150 million in 2013 compared with 2012 principally from planned workforce reductions. Cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute our repositioning actions were $136, $159, and $147 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Such expenditures for severance and other exit costs have been funded principally through operating cash flows. Cash expenditures for severance and other costs necessary to execute the remaining actions are expected to be approximately $175 million in 2013 and will be funded through operating cash flows. The following tables provide details of the pretax impact of total net repositioning and other charges by segment. ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2012  2011  2010 Aerospace       Net repositioning charge  $  (5 )  $    $          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2012  2011  2010 Automation and Control Solutions       Net repositioning charge  $    $    $          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2012  2011  2010 Performance Materials and Technologies       Net repositioning charge  $    $    $          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2012  2011  2010 Transportation Systems       Net repositioning charge  $    $    $   Asbestos related litigation charges, net of insurance   169    146    158           $    $    $          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2012  2011  2010 Corporate       Net repositioning charge  $     $    $    Asbestos related litigation charges, net of insurance   (13 )    3    17  Probable and reasonably estimable environmental liabilities   234    240    212  Other           62           $    $    $          ##TABLE_END 42 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets, as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables. We continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. Cash Flow Summary Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended 2012, 2011 and 2010, are summarized as follows: ##TABLE_START          2012  2011  2010 Cash provided by (used for):       Operating activities  $  3,517   $  2,833   $  4,203  Investing activities   (1,428 )    (611 )    (2,269 )  Financing activities   (1,206 )    (1,114 )    (2,047 )  Effect of exchange rate changes on cash   53    (60 )    (38 )         Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents  $    $  1,048   $  (151 )         ##TABLE_END 2012 compared with 2011 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $684 million during 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to reduced cash contributions to our pension plans of $706 million and a $344 million increase of net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, partially offset by higher cash tax payments of approximately $340 million. Cash used for investing activities increased by $817 million during 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to (i) a decrease in proceeds from sales of businesses of $1,135 million (most significantly the divestiture of the Consumer Products Group business and the automotive on-board sensor products business within our Automation and Control Solutions segment in 2011), (ii) a net $117 million increase in investments (primarily short-term marketable securities), and (iii) an increase in expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $86 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $535 million. Cash used for financing activities increased by $92 million during 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a decrease in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $825 million and an increase in dividends paid of $120 million, partially offset by a decrease of $806 million in net repurchases of common stock and a decrease of $33 million in the payment of debt assumed with acquisitions. 2011 compared with 2010 Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1,370 million during 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to i) increased voluntary cash contributions of $1,050 million to our U.S. pension plans, ii) an unfavorable impact from decreased deferred taxes (excluding the impact of cash taxes) of approximately $710 million, and iii) higher cash tax payments of approximately $500 million, partially offset by an $863 million increase of net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment. Cash used for investing activities decreased by $1,658 million during 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to an increase in proceeds from sale of businesses of $1,149 million (most significantly the divestiture of the Consumer Products Group business and the automotive on-board sensor products business within our Automation and Control Solutions segment), a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $330 million, and a net $315 million decrease in investments of short-term marketable securities. Cash used for financing activities decreased by $933 million during 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to an increase in the net proceeds from debt of $1,734 million and a decrease of $293 million in the payment of debt assumed with acquisitions, partially offset by an increase of $1,085 million of repurchases of common stock. Liquidity Each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. Considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies, including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, the Company believes that cash balances and operating cash flows are the principal source of liquidity. In addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets, as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables. At December 31, 2012, a substantial portion of the Companys cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. If the amounts held outside of the U.S. were to be repatriated, under current law, they would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability. A source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing potential acquisitions. There was $400 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2012. Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2012, Standard and Poors (SP), Fitch, and Moodys have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 respectively, and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1 respectively. SP, Fitch and Moodys have Honeywells rating outlook as stable. To date, the Company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity. We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions. As a source of liquidity, we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, none of the receivables in the designated pools had been sold to third parties. When we sell receivables, they are over-collateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that over-collateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools. The terms of the trade accounts receivable program permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion, providing us with an additional source of revolving credit. As a result, program receivables remain on the Companys balance sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as Short-term borrowings. On April 2, 2012, the Company entered into a $3,000 million Amended and Restated Five Year Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks. Commitments under the Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $3,500 million. The Credit Agreement contains a $700 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes and amends and restates the previous $2,800 million five year credit agreement dated March 31, 2011 (Prior Agreement). There have been no borrowings under the Credit Agreement or the Prior Agreement. We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Global economic conditions or a tightening of credit markets could adversely affect our customers or suppliers ability to obtain financing, particularly in our long-cycle businesses and airline, automotive and refining/petrochemical end markets. Customer or supplier bankruptcies, delays in their ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing could adversely affect our cash flow or results of operations. To date we have not experienced material impacts from customer or supplier bankruptcy or liquidity issues. We continue to monitor and take measures to limit our exposure. In February 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $3 billion of Honeywell common stock. During 2012, the Company repurchased $317 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including future option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans (see Part II, Item 5 for share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2012). On October 22, 2012, the Company acquired a 70 percent controlling interest in Thomas Russell Co., a privately-held leading provider of technology and equipment for natural gas processing and treating, for approximately $525 million ($368 million, net of cash). Thomas Russell Co.s results of operations have been consolidated into the Performance Materials and Technologies segment, with the noncontrolling interest portion reflected in net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the calendar year 2016, Honeywell has the right to acquire and the noncontrolling shareholder has the right to sell to Honeywell the remaining 30 percent interest at a price based on a multiple of Thomas Russell Co.s average annual operating income from 2013 to 2015, subject to a predetermined cap and floor. Additionally, Honeywell has the right to acquire the remaining 30 percent interest for a fixed price equivalent to the cap at any time on or before December 31, 2015. See Note 21 Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest. In December 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Intermec, Inc. (Intermec) a leading provider of mobile computing, radio frequency identification solutions (RFID) and bar code, label and receipt printers for use in warehousing, supply chain, field service and manufacturing environments for $10 per share in cash, or an aggregate purchase price of approximately $600 million, net of cash acquired. Intermec is a U.S. public company which operates globally and had reported 2011 revenues of approximately $850 million. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2013, pending Intermec shareholder approval and following customary regulatory reviews. The acquisition is expected to be funded with available cash and the issuance of commercial paper. Intermec will be integrated into our Automation and Control Solutions segment. During 2012, the Company made cash contributions of $1,039 million principally to improve the funded status of our pension plans. In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, dividends, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments. Specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2013 to be as follows: ##TABLE_START    Capital expenditureswe expect to spend approximately $1.2 billion for capital expenditures in 2013 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement.     Share repurchasesunder the Companys previously reported $3 billion share repurchase program, $1.6 billion remained available as of December 31, 2012 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time during 2013 to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including future option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings ##TABLE_END 45 ##TABLE_START    plans. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating, financing and other investing activities.     Dividendswe expect to pay approximately $1.3 billion in dividends on our common stock in 2013, reflecting the 10 percent increase in the dividend rate effective with the fourth quarter 2012 dividend.     Asbestos claimswe expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $480 and $44 million, respectively, in 2013. We believe it is possible that the effective date of the NARCO Plan of Reorganization will occur in 2013 so we have included estimated funding for the NARCO Trust in 2013. See Asbestos Matters in Note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of possible funding obligations in 2013 related to the NARCO Trust.     Pension contributionsin 2013, we are not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans. We plan to make cash contributions of approximately $150 million ($113 million was made in January 2013) to our non-U.S. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. The timing and amount of contributions to both our U.S. and non-U.S. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans.     Repositioning actionswe expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the previously announced repositioning actions will approximate $175 million in 2013.     Environmental remediation costswe expect to spend approximately $300 million in 2013 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs. See Environmental Matters in Note 22 to the financial statements for additional information. ##TABLE_END We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2012 and 2011, we realized $21 and $1,156 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from sales of non-strategic businesses. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines, access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. Contractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments Following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2012: ##TABLE_START              Total(6)  Payments by Period  Thereafter  2013  2014- 2015  2016- 2017 Long-term debt, including capitalized leases(1)  $  7,020   $    $    $    $  4,821  Interest payments on long-term debt, including capitalized leases   2,798    240    400    357    1,801  Minimum operating lease payments   1,288    305    442    229    312  Purchase obligations(2)   1,783    939    474    223    147  Estimated environmental liability payments(3)   654    304    200    100    50  Asbestos related liability payments(4)   1,772    480    769    438    85  Asbestos insurance recoveries(5)   (707 )    (44 )    (147 )    (141 )    (375 )               $  14,608   $  2,849   $  2,849   $  2,069   $  6,841             ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1)   Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity. (2)    Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. (3)    The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2012. See Environmental Matters in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information. (4)    These amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2012. We believe that it is possible that the effective date of the NARCO Plan of Reorganization will occur in 2013 so we have included estimated funding for the NARCO Trust starting in 2013. We have accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO trust through 2018. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims since January 2002, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Projecting the timing of NARCO payments is dependent on, among other things, the effective date of the Trust which could cause the timing of payments to be earlier or later than that projected. Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause asbestos liabilities to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. See Asbestos Matters in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information. (5)    These amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos related liabilities as of December 31, 2012. The timing of insurance recoveries are impacted by the terms of insurance settlement agreements, as well as the documentation, review and collection process required to collect on insurance claims. Where probable insurance recoveries are not subject to definitive settlement agreements with specified payment dates, but instead are covered by insurance policies, we have assumed collection will occur beyond 2017. Projecting the timing of insurance recoveries is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the amounts collected to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded or could cause the timing of collections to be earlier or later than that projected. We reevaluate our projections concerning insurance recoveries in light of any changes or developments that would impact recoveries or the timing thereof. See Asbestos Matters in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information. (6)    The table excludes tax effects as well as $722 million of uncertain tax positions. See Note 6 Income Taxes of Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information. ##TABLE_END 47 The table also excludes our pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) obligations. In 2013, we are not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans, however, we plan to make cash contributions of approximately $150 million ($113 million was made in January 2013) to our non-U.S. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. The timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans. Beyond 2013, the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations. Payments due under our OPEB plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans. We expect our OPEB payments to approximate $149 million in 2013 net of the benefit of approximately $11 million from the Medicare prescription subsidy. See Note 23 to the financial statements for further discussion of our pension and OPEB plans. The noncontrolling interest shareholder of Thomas Russell Co., one of our subsidiaries, has put rights that may be exercised causing us to purchase their equity interests beginning January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. The same interest is subject to certain call rights by the Company. As the amount paid is based on operating income performance from 2013 to 2015, the actual settlement amount may be different and has therefore been excluded from this table. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Following is a summary of our off-balance sheet arrangements: Guarantees We have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at December 31, 2012: ##TABLE_START      Maximum Potential Future Payments Operating lease residual values  $   Other third parties financing   5  Unconsolidated affiliates financing   12  Customer financing   9      $      ##TABLE_END We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination, if any, existing on the date of disposition. Such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly, with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters. It is our policy (see Note 1 to the financial statements) to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. Remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were $234, $240 and $225 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the recorded liabilities for environmental matters was $654 and $723 million, respectively. In addition, in 2012 and 2011 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $84 and $102 million, respectively, relating to compliance with environmental regulations. Remedial response and voluntary cleanup payments were $320, $270 and $266 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are currently estimated to be approximately $300 million in 2013. We expect to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow. Although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. See Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies, including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation. Financial Instruments As a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. A summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to the Financial Statements. We also hold investments in marketable equity securities, which exposes us to market volatility, as discussed in Note 16 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to the Financial Statements. We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade. Our objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency cash flows. We attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties. Our principal currency exposures relate to the U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Mexican peso, Indian rupee, Korean won, Czech koruna, Hong Kong dollar, Singapore dollar, Romanian leu, Swiss franc, Swedish krona, and Thai baht. Our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our net debt and pension obligations. As described in Note 14 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements and Note 16 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to the Financial Statements, we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs. Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and expected future cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. The following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one-percentage-point increase in interest rates across all maturities, the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities, and the potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent decrease in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities at December 31, 2012 and 2011. ##TABLE_START            Face or Notional Amount  Carrying Value(1)  Fair Value(1)  Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value December 31, 2012         Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments         Long-term debt (including current maturities)  $  7,020   $  (7,020 )   $  (8,152 )   $  (555 )  Interest rate swap agreements   1,400    146    146    (67 )  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments         Foreign currency exchange contracts(2)   8,506    20    20    361  Commodity Price Sensitive Instruments         Forward commodity contracts(3)   17            (3 )  December 31, 2011         Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments         Long-term debt (including current maturities)  $  6,896   $  (6,896 )   $  (7,896 )   $  (578 )  Interest rate swap agreements   1,400    134    134    (74 )  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments         Foreign currency exchange contracts(2)   7,108    (26 )    (26 )    274  Commodity Price Sensitive Instruments         Forward commodity contracts(3)   59    (9 )    (9 )    (10 )  ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1)   Asset or (liability). (2)    Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions. (3)    Changes in the fair value of forward commodity contracts are offset by changes in the cash flows of underlying hedged commodity transactions. ##TABLE_END The above discussion of our procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from our sensitivity analyses are forward-looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. The methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and our Independent Registered Public Accountants. New accounting standards effective in 2012 which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements are described in the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to the Financial Statements. Contingent Liabilities We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. For a discussion of our contingencies related to environmental, asbestos and other matters, including managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities, see Notes 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements. Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries We are a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos (refractory and friction products). We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO trust through 2018 as described in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements. In light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims since January 2002, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. We will continue to update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future Bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year. For additional information see Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers, our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers, various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers. Our insurance is with both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. See Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. We recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment) and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered. Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change as they may each year. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets. This accounting method also results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM charges were $957, $1,802 and $471 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The remaining components of pension income/expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded on a quarterly basis (Pension Ongoing Income/Expense). For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension income/expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations on future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 23 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to the Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. Information on all our major actuarial assumptions is included in Note 23 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to the Financial Statements. The key assumptions used in developing our 2012, 2011 and 2010 net periodic pension expense for our U.S. plans included the following: ##TABLE_START          2012  2011  2010 Discount rate   4.89 %    5.25 %    5.75 %  Assets:       Expected rate of return   8 %    8 %    9 %  Actual rate of return   13 %        19 %  Actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return   8 %    6 %    6 %  ##TABLE_END 52 The discount rate can be volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We will use a 4.06 percent discount rate in 2013, reflecting the decrease in the market interest rate environment since December 31, 2011. We will use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75 percent for 2013 down from 8 percent in 2012 due to lower future expected market returns. In addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment: ##TABLE_START      Change in Assumption  Impact on 2013 Pension Ongoing Expense  Impact on PBO 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate  Decrease $9 million  Increase $565 million 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate  Increase $7 million  Decrease $545 million 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets  Increase $35 million   0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets  Decrease $35 million   ##TABLE_END Pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to range from $50 to $75 million in 2013 compared with ongoing pension expense of $36 million in 2012. The increase in pension ongoing income in 2013 compared with 2012 results primarily from an increase in the plans assets at December 31, 2012 compared with December 31, 2011 due to contributions and strong asset returns in 2012. Also, if required, an MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2013, and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our U.S. pension plans. However, we made voluntary contributions of $792, $1,650 and $1,000 million to our U.S. pension plans in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily to improve the funded status of our plans which has been adversely impacted by relatively low discount rates and asset losses in 2011 and 2008 resulting from the poor performance of the equity markets. In 2013, we are not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans, however, we plan to make cash contributions of approximately $150 million ($113 million was made in January 2013) to our non-U.S. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. The timing and amount of contributions to both our U.S. and non-U.S. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans. Long-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets) To conduct our global business operations and execute our business strategy, we acquire tangible and intangible assets, including property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets. At December 31, 2012, the net carrying amount of these long-lived assets totaled approximately $6.7 billion. The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not these assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations;     Annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line; ##TABLE_END 53 ##TABLE_START     Significant negative industry or economic trends; and     Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. ##TABLE_END Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 in the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates, our assumptions as to volume, selling prices and costs, and the discount rate selected. As described in more detail in Note 16 to the financial statements, we have recorded impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $22 million and $127 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment in facilities scheduled to close or be downsized. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks acquired in business combinations. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing. Our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances of $12.4 billion and $725 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2012, are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value is reduced to fair value. In testing goodwill, the fair value of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. This impairment test involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions. We completed our annual impairment test as of March 31, 2012 and determined that there was no impairment to our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of that date. However, significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair values. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances, including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions. As of December 31, 2012, we recorded a net deferred tax asset of $2,473 million, less a valuation allowance of $598 million. Net deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of net deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods. The determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. The projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs. Additionally, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws. Our net deferred tax asset of $2,473 million consists of $1,422 million related to U.S. operations and $1,051 million related to non-U.S. operations. The U.S. net deferred tax asset of $1,422 million consists of net deductible temporary differences, tax credit carryforwards, state tax net operating losses which we believe will more likely than not be realized through the generation of future taxable income in the U.S. and tax planning strategies. The non-U.S. net deferred tax asset of $1,051 million consists principally of net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards, mainly in Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and the United Kingdom. We maintain a valuation allowance of $598 million against these deferred tax assets reflecting our historical experience and lower expectations of taxable income over the applicable carryforward periods. As more fully described in Note 6 to the financial statements, our valuation allowance increased by $7 million in 2012, decreased by $45 million in 2011 and increased by $58 million in 2010, respectively. In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income in the period that such determination is made. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance and this guidance determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Sales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts In 2012, we recognized approximately 16 percent of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts in our Automation and Control Solutions, Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies segments. These long- term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting Principles The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is a description of Honeywells significant accounting policies. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. Our consolidation policy requires equity investments that we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investees activities to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. The Consumer Products Group (CPG) automotive aftermarket business had historically been part of the Transportation Systems reportable segment. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, CPG is presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures for further details. Noncontrolling interest is included within the equity section in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Redeemable noncontrolling interest is considered to be temporary equity and is therefore reported outside of permanent equity on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at the greater of the initial carrying amount adjusted for the noncontrolling interests share of net income (loss) or its redemption value. We present the amount of consolidated net income that is attributable to Honeywell and the noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Furthermore, we disclose the amount of comprehensive income that is attributable to Honeywell and the noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit and highly liquid, temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out or the average cost method and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for certain qualifying domestic inventories. Investments Investments in affiliates over which we have a significant influence, but not a controlling interest, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Other investments are carried at market value, if readily determinable, or at cost. All equity investments are periodically reviewed to determine if declines in fair value below cost basis are other-than-temporary. Significant and sustained decreases in quoted market prices or a series of historic and projected operating losses by investees are strong indicators of other-than-temporary declines. If the decline in fair value is determined to be other- than-temporary, an impairment loss is recorded and the investment is written down to a new carrying value. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding assets useful life. See Note 11 Property, Plant and Equipment - Net and Note 17 Other Liabilities of Notes to the Financial Statements for additional details. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) amortized. Intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2012 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. See Note 12 for additional details on goodwill balances. Other Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years. Long-Lived Assets We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with determinable lives) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate events or changes in circumstances based on a number of factors including operating results, business plans and forecasts, general and industry trends and, economic projections and anticipated cash flows. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in earnings. We also continually evaluate the estimated useful lives of all long-lived assets and periodically revise such estimates based on current events. Sales Recognition Product and service sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities in our Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments, are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts in the Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions and Performance Materials and Technologies segments are recorded on a percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident. Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis. Amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses as a result of customers inability to make required payments. We estimate anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on days past due, as measured from the contractual due date, historical collection history and incorporate changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in historical trends for example, customers in bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization. Receivables are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are determined uncollectible. Such determination includes analysis and consideration of the particular conditions of the account, including time intervals since last collection, success of outside collection agencies activity, solvency of customer and any bankruptcy proceedings. Environmental Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and that do not provide future benefits, are expensed as incurred. Liabilities are recorded when environmental remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries Honeywell is a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos (refractory and friction products). We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust through 2018 as described in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements. In light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims since January 2002, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. We will continue to update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future Bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year. For additional information see Note 22. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers, our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers, various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers. Aerospace Sales Incentives We provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of our aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and braking system hardware and auxiliary power units, for installation on commercial aircraft. These incentives principally consist of free or deeply discounted products, but also include credits for future purchases of product and upfront cash payments. These costs are recognized in the period incurred as cost of products sold or as a reduction to sales, as appropriate. For aircraft manufacturers, incentives are recorded when the products are delivered; for airlines, incentives are recorded when the associated aircraft are delivered by the aircraft manufacturer to the airline. Research and Development Research and development costs for company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred. Such costs are principally included in Cost of Products Sold and were $1,847, $1,799 and $1,450 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Plans The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 20 Stock-Based Compensation Plans of Notes to HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) the Financial Statements, include non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs). The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant in order to estimate the portion of the award that will ultimately vest. The estimate is based on our historical rates of forfeiture. Pension Benefits We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. We recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment), and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered. The remaining components of pension expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded on a quarterly basis (Pension ongoing income/expense). Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings. Derivative Financial Instruments As a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract. All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. Transfers of Financial Instruments Sales, transfers and securitization of financial instruments are accounted for under authoritative guidance for the transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities. We sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. The terms of the trade accounts receivable program permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion. As a result, these program receivables are not accounted for as a sale and remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as Short-term borrowings. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) At times we also transfer trade and other receivables that qualify as a sale and are thus are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the time they are sold. The value assigned to any subordinated interests and undivided interests retained in receivables sold is based on the relative fair values of the interests retained and sold. The carrying value of the retained interests approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the collection period for the receivables. Income Taxes Deferred tax liabilities or assets reflect temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting. Such amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the amount of a valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. The projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs. Additionally, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance and this guidance determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the tax filings of the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the form of accounting standards updates (ASUs) to the FASBs Accounting Standards Codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) In May 2011, the FASB issued amendments to disclosure requirements for common fair value measurement. These amendments, effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011 (early adoption is prohibited), result in a common definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Consequently, the amendments change some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements. The implementation of the amended accounting guidance has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2011, the FASB issued amendments to disclosure requirements for presentation of comprehensive income. This guidance, effective retrospectively for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011 (early adoption is permitted), requires presentation of total comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the presentation on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for annual and interim financial statements. The implementation of the amended accounting guidance has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In February 2013, the FASB issued amendments to disclosure requirements for presentation of comprehensive income. The standard requires presentation (either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements) of the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income based on its source and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification. If a component is not required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety, a cross reference to the related footnote for additional information will be required. The amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012 (early adoption is permitted). The implementation of the amended accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2011, the FASB issued amendments to the goodwill impairment guidance which provides an option for companies to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment if certain conditions are met. The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 (early adoption is permitted). The implementation of the amended accounting guidance has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In July 2012, the FASB issued amendments to the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment guidance which provides an option for companies to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment if certain conditions are met. The amendments are effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012 (early adoption is permitted). The implementation of the amended accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Note 2Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisitions We acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash acquired) of $438, $973, and $1,303 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For all of our acquisitions the acquired businesses were recorded at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Significant acquisitions made in these years are discussed below. In December 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Intermec, Inc. (Intermec) a leading provider of mobile computing, radio frequency identification solutions (RFID) and bar code, label and receipt printers for use in warehousing, supply chain, field service and manufacturing environments for $10 per share in cash, or an aggregate purchase price of HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) approximately $600 million, net of cash acquired. Intermec is a U.S. public company which operates globally and had reported 2011 revenues of approximately $850 million. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2013, pending Intermec shareholder approval and following customary regulatory reviews. The acquisition is expected to be funded with available cash and the issuance of commercial paper. Intermec will be integrated into our Automation and Control Solutions segment. On October 22, 2012, the Company acquired a 70 percent controlling interest in Thomas Russell Co., a privately-held leading provider of technology and equipment for natural gas processing and treating, for approximately $525 million ($368 million, net of cash acquired). Thomas Russell Co.s results of operations have been consolidated into the Performance Materials and Technologies segment, with the noncontrolling interest portion reflected in net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the calendar year 2016, Honeywell has the right to acquire and the noncontrolling shareholder has the right to sell to Honeywell the remaining 30 percent interest at a price based on a multiple of Thomas Russell Co.s average annual operating income from 2013 to 2015, subject to a predetermined cap and floor. Additionally, Honeywell has the right to acquire the remaining 30 percent interest for a fixed price equivalent to the cap at any time on or before December 31, 2015. See Note 21 Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest. The aggregate value of Thomas Russell Co. was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their consolidated estimated fair values at the acquisition date. On a preliminary basis, the Company has assigned approximately $215 million to identifiable intangible assets. The intangible assets are predominantly backlog, technology, and trademarks. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives, which range from 2 to 10 years, using both straight-line and accelerated amortization methods. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired (approximating $440 million), was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill arises primarily from the avoidance of the time and costs which would be required (and the associated risks that would be encountered) to enhance our product offerings to key target markets and serve as entry into new and profitable businesses within the Performance Materials and Technologies segment. Our interest in the acquired goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. The following amounts represent the preliminary determination of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. ##TABLE_START    Cash  $   Accounts and other receivables   85  Other assets   16  Intangible assets   215  Deferred revenue   (221 )  Other current liabilities   (18 )     Net assets acquired   234  Goodwill   440  Redeemable noncontrolling interest   (149 )     Purchase price  $      ##TABLE_END The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2012 are included in the Performance Materials and Technologies segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2012, the purchase accounting for Thomas Russell Co. is subject to final adjustment primarily for the determination of useful lives of intangible assets, amounts allocated to intangible assets and goodwill, and tax balances. In December 2011, the Company acquired Kings Safetywear Limited (KSW), a leading international provider of branded safety footwear. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) approximately $331 million (including the assumption of debt of $33 million) and was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The Company has assigned approximately $167 million to identifiable intangible assets, predominantly trademarks, technology, and customer relationships. The definite lived intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives, using straight-line and accelerated amortization methods. The value assigned to trademarks of approximately $84 million is classified as indefinite lived intangibles. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired (approximately $157 million), was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill arises primarily from the avoidance of the time and costs which would be required (and the associated risks that would be encountered) to enhance our product offerings to key target markets and serve as entry into new and profitable segments, and the expected cost synergies that will be realized through the consolidation of the acquired business into our Automation and Control Solutions segment. Their cost synergies are expected to be realized principally in the areas of selling, general and administrative expenses, material sourcing and manufacturing. This goodwill is nondeductible for tax purposes. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2011 are included in the Automation and Control Solutions segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. In August 2011, the Company acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of EMS Technologies, Inc. (EMS), a leading provider of connectivity solutions for mobile networking, rugged mobile computers and satellite communications. EMS had reported 2010 revenues of approximately $355 million. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was approximately $513 million and was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The Company has assigned approximately $119 million to identifiable intangible assets, of which approximately $89 million and approximately $30 million were recorded within the Aerospace and Automation and Control segments, respectively. The intangible assets are predominantly customer relationships, existing technology and trademarks. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives, using straight-line and accelerated amortization methods. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired (approximating $314 million), was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill arises primarily from the avoidance of the time and costs which would be required (and the associated risks that would be encountered) to enhance our product offerings to key target markets and serve as entry into new and profitable segments, and the expected cost synergies that will be realized through the consolidation of the acquired business into our Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments. These cost synergies are expected to be realized principally in the areas of selling, general and administrative expenses, material sourcing and manufacturing. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2011 are included in the Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. In October 2010, we completed the acquisition of the issued and outstanding shares of Sperian Protection (Sperian), a French company that operates globally in the personal protection equipment design and manufacturing industry. Sperian had reported 2009 revenues of approximately $900 million. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was approximately $1,475 million (including the assumption of approximately $326 million of outstanding debt) and was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The following amounts represent the final determination of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives which range from 3 to 20 years using straight line and accelerated amortization methods. Included in this amount, a value of approximately $246 million has been assigned to trade names intangibles determined to have indefinite lives. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is approximately $930 million and was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill arises primarily from the avoidance of the time and costs which would be required (and the associated risks that would be encountered) to develop a business with a product offering and customer base comparable to Sperian and the expected cost synergies that will be realized through the consolidation of the acquired business into our Automations and Controls Solutions segment. These cost synergies are expected to be realized principally in the areas of selling, general and administrative expenses, material sourcing and manufacturing. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2010 are included in the Automation and Control Solutions segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with all acquisitions in 2012, 2011 and 2010, the amounts recorded for transaction costs and the costs of integrating the acquired businesses into Honeywell were not material. The pro forma results for 2012, 2011 and 2010, assuming these acquisitions had been made at the beginning of the comparable prior year, would not be materially different from consolidated reported results. Divestitures In July 2011, the Company sold its Consumer Products Group business (CPG) to Rank Group Limited. The sale was completed for approximately $955 million in cash proceeds, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $301 million and approximately $178 million, net of tax. The gain was recorded in net income from discontinued operations after taxes in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. The net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest for the discontinued operations is insignificant. The sale of CPG, which had been part of the Transportation Systems segment, is consistent with the Companys strategic focus on its portfolio of differentiated global technologies. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The key components of income from discontinued operations related to CPG were as follows: ##TABLE_START        Years Ended December 31,  2011  2010 Net sales  $    $  1,020  Costs, expenses and other   421    798  Selling, general and administrative expense   63    99  Other (income) expense   (2 )    2       Income before taxes   48    121       Gain on disposal of discontinued operations   301           Net income from discontinued operations before taxes   349    121       Tax expense   140    43       Net income from discontinued operations after taxes  $    $        ##TABLE_END Note 3Repositioning and Other Charges A summary of repositioning and other charges follows: ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2012  2011  2010 Severance  $    $    $   Asset impairments   12    86    21  Exit costs   16    48    14  Reserve adjustments   (66 )    (26 )    (30 )         Total net repositioning charge   53    354    149         Asbestos related litigation charges, net of insurance   156    149    175  Probable and reasonably estimable environmental liabilities   234    240    212  Other           62         Total net repositioning and other charges  $    $    $          ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes the pretax distribution of total net repositioning and other charges by income statement classification: ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2012  2011  2010 Cost of products and services sold  $    $    $   Selling, general and administrative expenses   15    97    40          $    $    $          ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes the pretax impact of total net repositioning and other charges by segment: ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2012  2011  2010 Aerospace  $  (5 )   $    $   Automation and Control Solutions   18    191    79  Performance Materials and Technologies   12    41    18  Transportation Systems   197    228    178  Corporate   221    254    291           $    $    $          ##TABLE_END 71 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) In 2012, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $119 million including severance costs of $91 million related to workforce reductions of 2,204 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to the planned shutdown of a manufacturing facility in our Transportation Systems segment, the exit from a product line in our Performance Materials and Technologies segment, and cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. The repositioning charge also included asset impairments of $12 million principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment associated with the exit of a product line in our Performance Materials and Technologies segment. The repositioning charge also included exit costs of $16 million principally related to closure obligations associated with the planned shutdown of a manufacturing facility in our Transportation Systems segment and exit from a product line in our Performance Materials and Technologies segment. Also, $66 million of previously established accruals primarily for severance at our Automation and Control Solutions, Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies segments were returned to income in 2012 due primarily to fewer employee severance actions caused by higher attrition than originally planned associated with prior severance programs and changes in the scope of previously announced repositioning actions. In 2011, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $380 million including severance costs of $246 million related to workforce reductions of 3,188 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to the planned shutdown of a manufacturing facility in our Transportation Systems segment, cost savings actions taken in connection with our ongoing functional transformation and productivity initiatives, factory transitions in connection with acquisition-related synergies in our Automation and Control Solutions and Aerospace segments, the exit from and/or rationalization of certain product lines and markets in our Performance Materials and Technologies and Automation and Control Solutions segments, the consolidation of repair facilities in our Aerospace segment, and factory consolidations and/or rationalizations and organizational realignments of businesses in our Automation and Control Solutions segment. The repositioning charges included asset impairments of $86 million principally related to the write-off of certain intangible assets in our Automation and Control Solutions segment due to a change in branding strategy and manufacturing plant and equipment associated with the planned shutdown of a manufacturing facility and the exit of a product line and a factory transition as discussed above. The repositioning charges also included exit costs of $48 million principally for costs to terminate contracts related to the exit of a market and product line and a factory transition as discussed above. Exit costs also included closure obligations associated with the planned shutdown of a manufacturing facility and exit of a product line also as discussed above. Also, $26 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance at our Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments, were returned to income in 2011 due principally to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with prior severance programs. In 2010, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $179 million including severance costs of $144 million related to workforce reductions of 2,781 manufacturing and administrative positions primarily in our Automation and Control Solutions, Aerospace and Transportation Systems segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to the planned shutdown of certain manufacturing facilities in our Automation and Control Solutions and Transportation Systems segments, cost savings actions taken in connection with our ongoing functional transformation and productivity initiatives, factory transitions in our Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions and Performance Materials and Technologies segments to more cost-effective locations, achieving acquisition-related synergies in our Automation and Control Solutions segment, and the exit and/or rationalization of certain product lines in our Performance Materials and Technologies segment. The repositioning charge also included asset impairments of $21 million principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment associated with the exit and/or rationalization of certain product lines and in facilities scheduled to close. Also, $30 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance at our Automation and Control Solutions, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

The foreign effective tax rate was 17.0 percent, a decrease of approximately 4.1 percentage points which primarily consisted of a 10.0 percent impact related to a decrease in tax reserves, partially offset by a 5.2 percent impact from increased valuation allowances on net operating losses primarily due to a decrease in Luxembourg and French earnings available to be offset by net operating loss carry forwards and a 1.4 percent impact from tax expense related to foreign exchange. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign rates. The effective tax rate decreased by 9.8 percentage points in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign sources related to higher U.S. pension expense (primarily driven by an approximate 7.6 percentage point impact which resulted from the increase in pension mark-to-market expense), an increased benefit from manufacturing incentives, an increased benefit from the favorable settlement of tax audits and an increased benefit from a lower foreign effective tax rate. The foreign effective tax rate was 21.1 percent, a decrease of approximately 4.9 percentage points which primarily consisted of (i) a 5.1 percent impact from decreased valuation allowances on net operating losses primarily due to an increase in German earnings available to be offset by net operating loss carry forwards; (ii) a 2.4 percent impact from tax benefits related to foreign exchange and investment losses; (iii) a 1.2 percent impact from an increased benefit in tax credits and lower statutory tax rates and (iv) a 4.1 percent impact related to an increase in tax reserves. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign rates. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Deferred tax assets (liabilities) Deferred income taxes represent the future tax effects of transactions which are reported in different periods for tax and financial reporting purposes. The tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which give rise to future income tax benefits and payables are as follows: ##TABLE_START        December 31,  2012  2011 Property, plant and equipment basis differences  $  (928 )   $  (1,097 )  Postretirement benefits other than pensions and post employment benefits   620    571  Investment and other asset basis differences   (1,084 )    (970 )  Other accrued items   2,918    2,852  Net operating and capital losses   820    810  Tax credits   232    379  Undistributed earnings of subsidiaries   (60 )    (57 )  All other itemsnet   (45 )    (67 )         2,473    2,421  Valuation allowance   (598 )    (591 )        $  1,875   $  1,830       ##TABLE_END The Company has state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $3.0 billion at December 31, 2012 with various expiration dates through 2030. We also have foreign net operating and capital losses of $2.8 billion which are available to reduce future income tax payments in several countries, subject to varying expiration rules. We have U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards of $6 million at December 31, 2012 with various expiration dates through 2031. We also have state tax credit carryforwards of $55 million at December 31, 2012, including carryforwards of $33 million with various expiration dates through 2027 and tax credits of $22 million which are not subject to expiration. The valuation allowance against deferred tax assets increased by $7 million in 2012 and decreased by $45 million and increased by $58 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 2012 increase in the valuation allowance was primarily due to decreased earnings in France and Luxembourg, partially offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance related to purchase accounting for various acquisitions and audit settlements for various countries. The 2011 decrease in the valuation allowance was primarily due to decreased foreign net operating losses related to the Netherlands and Germany, partially offset by the increase in the valuation allowance of France, Luxembourg and Canada. The 2010 increase in the valuation allowance was primarily due to increased foreign net operating losses related to France, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands offset by the reversal of a valuation allowance related to Germany. The 2010 increase in valuation allowance also includes adjustments related to purchase accounting for various acquisitions. Federal income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of the majority of our international subsidiaries as it is our intention to reinvest these earnings into the respective subsidiaries. At December 31, 2012 Honeywell has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $11.6 billion of such earnings of our non-U.S. operations. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability. We had $722 million, $815 million and $757 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 respectively. If recognized, $722 million would be recorded as a component of income tax expense as of December 31, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company decreased its unrecognized tax benefits by $93 million due to the expiration of various HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) statute of limitations and settlements with tax authorities, partially offset by adjustments related to our ongoing assessment of the likelihood and amount of potential outcomes of current and future examinations. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company increased its unrecognized tax benefits by $58 million due to additional reserves for various international and U.S. tax audit matters, partially offset by adjustments related to our ongoing assessment of the likelihood and amount of potential outcomes of current and future examinations, the expiration of various statute of limitations, and settlements with tax authorities. The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START          2012  2011  2010 Change in unrecognized tax benefits:       Balance at beginning of year  $    $    $   Gross increases related to current period tax positions   25    46    37  Gross increases related to prior periods tax positions   44    327    84  Gross decreases related to prior periods tax positions   (62 )    (56 )    (41 )  Decrease related to settlements with tax authorities   (40 )    (237 )    (23 )  Expiration of the statute of limitations for the assessment of taxes   (64 )    (12 )    (8 )  Foreign currency translation   4    (10 )    (12 )         Balance at end of year  $    $    $          ##TABLE_END Generally, our uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. The following table summarizes these open tax years by major jurisdiction as of December 31, 2012: ##TABLE_START      Jurisdiction  Open Tax Year  Examination in progress  Examination not yet initiated United States(1)  2001    2011  2005    2012 United Kingdom  N/A  2011    2012 Canada(1)  2006    2010  2011    2012 Germany(1)  2004    2009  2010    2012 France  2009    2011  2000    2008, 2012 Netherlands  2009  2010    2012 Australia  N/A  2009    2012 China  2009    2010  2006    2008, 2011    2012 India  20002010  2011    2012 Italy  2005    2011  2012 ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1)   Includes federal as well as state, provincial or similar local jurisdictions, as applicable. ##TABLE_END Based on the outcome of these examinations, or as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns will materially change from those recorded as liabilities for uncertain tax positions in our financial statements. In addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods. Based on the number of tax years currently under audit by the relevant U.S federal, state and foreign tax authorities, the Company anticipates that several of these audits may be finalized in the foreseeable future. However, based on the status of these examinations, the protocol of finalizing audits by the relevant taxing authorities, and the possibility that the Company might challenge certain audit findings (which could include formal legal proceedings), at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Unrecognized tax benefits for examinations in progress were $443 million, $482 million and $274 million, as of December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The decrease from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to the expiration of various statute of limitations and settlements with tax authorities. The increase from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to an increase in tax examinations. Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of Tax Expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and totaled $37 million, $63 million and $33 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties were $284 million, $247 million and $183 million, as of December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.

Commitments under the Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $3,500 million. The Credit Agreement contains a $700 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes and amends and restates the previous $2,800 million five year credit agreement dated March 31, 2011 (Prior Agreement). There have been no borrowings under the Credit Agreement or the Prior Agreement. The Credit Agreement does not restrict our ability to pay dividends and contains no financial covenants. The failure to comply with customary conditions or the occurrence of customary events of default contained in the credit agreement would prevent any further borrowings and would generally require the repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement. Such events of default include: (a) non-payment of credit agreement debt, interest or fees; (b) non-compliance with the terms of the credit agreement covenants; (c) cross-default to other debt in certain circumstances; (d) bankruptcy; and (e) defaults upon obligations under Employee Retirement Income Security Act. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Additionally, each of the banks has the right to terminate its commitment to lend additional funds or issue letters of credit under the agreement if any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 30 percent or more of our voting stock, or, during any 12-month period, individuals who were directors of Honeywell at the beginning of the period cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors. The Credit Agreement has substantially the same material terms and conditions as the Prior Agreement with an improvement in pricing and an extension of maturity. Loans under the Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no later than April 2, 2017, unless such date is extended pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. We have agreed to pay a facility fee of 0.08 percent per annum on the aggregate commitment. Revolving credit borrowings under the Credit Agreement would bear interest, at Honeywells option, (A) (1) at a rate equal to the highest of (a) the floating base rate publicly announced by Citibank, N.A., (b) 0.5 percent above the Federal funds rate or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00 percent, plus (2) a margin based on Honeywells credit default swap mid-rate spread and subject to a floor and a cap as set forth in the Credit Agreement (the Applicable Margin) minus 1.00 percent, provided such margin shall not be less than zero; or (B) at a rate equal to LIBOR plus the Applicable Margin; or (C) by a competitive bidding procedure. The facility fee and the letter of credit issuance fee are subject to change, based upon a grid determined by our long term debt ratings. The Credit Agreement is not subject to termination based upon a decrease in our debt ratings or a material adverse change. In February 2011, the Company issued $800 million 4.25 percent Senior Notes due 2021 and $600 million 5.375 percent Senior Notes due 2041 (collectively, the Notes). The Notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywells existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of Honeywells subordinated debt. The offering resulted in gross proceeds of $1,400 million, offset by $19 million in discount and closing costs related to the offering. In the first quarter of 2011, the Company repurchased the entire outstanding principal amount of its $400 million 5.625 percent Notes due 2012 via a cash tender offer and a subsequent optional redemption. The cost relating to the early redemption of the Notes, including the make-whole premium, was $29 million. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company repaid $500 million of its 6.125 percent notes. The repayment was funded with cash provided by operating activities. As a source of liquidity, we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, none of the receivables in the designated pools had been sold to third parties. When we sell receivables, they are over-collateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that over-collateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools. The terms of the trade accounts receivable program permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion, providing us with an additional source of revolving credit. As a result, program receivables remain on the Companys balance sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as Short-term borrowings. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Note 15Lease Commitments Future minimum lease payments under operating leases having initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows: ##TABLE_START      At December 31, 2012  $   2014   251  2015   191  2016   133  2017   96  Thereafter   312      $  1,288     ##TABLE_END We have entered into agreements to lease land, equipment and buildings. Principally all our operating leases have initial terms of up to 25 years, and some contain renewal options subject to customary conditions. At any time during the terms of some of our leases, we may at our option purchase the leased assets for amounts that approximate fair value. We do not expect that any of our commitments under the lease agreements will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Rent expense was $390, $386 and $369 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Note 16Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Credit and Market Risk Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers. Foreign Currency Risk Management We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. Our objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency denominated cash flows. We attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts with third parties. We hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in Other (Income) Expense. We partially hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which predominantly occur in the next twelve months and are denominated in non-functional currencies, with HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) currency forward contracts. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the currency forward contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. Open foreign currency exchange forward contracts mature predominantly in the next twelve months. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had contracts with notional amounts of $8,506 million and $7,108 million, respectively, to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Mexican peso, Indian rupee, Korean won, Czech koruna, Hong Kong dollar, Singapore dollar, Romanian leu, Swiss franc, Swedish krona, and Thai baht. Commodity Price Risk Management Our exposure to market risk for commodity prices can result in changes in our cost of production. We primarily mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk through the use of long-term, fixed-price contracts with our suppliers and formula price agreements with suppliers and customers. We also enter into forward commodity contracts with third parties designated as hedges of anticipated purchases of several commodities. Forward commodity contracts are marked-to-market, with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had contracts with notional amounts of $17 million and $59 million, respectively, related to forward commodity agreements, principally base metals and natural gas. Interest Rate Risk Management We use a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively changed $1,400 million of fixed rate debt at a rate of 4.09 to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Our interest rate swaps mature at various dates through 2021. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The FASBs accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The FASBs guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy: ##TABLE_START    Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or   Unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or   Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability Level 3  Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability ##TABLE_END The Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2012 and 2011: HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2. The Company holds investments in marketable equity securities that are designated as available for sale and are valued using quoted market prices. As such, these investments are classified within level 1. The Company also holds investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale and are valued using market transactions in over-the-counter markets. As such, these investments are classified within level 2. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were not carried at fair value: ##TABLE_START            December 31, 2012  December 31, 2011  Carrying Value  Fair Value  Carrying Value  Fair Value Assets         Long-term receivables  $    $    $    $   Liabilities         Long-term debt and related current maturities  $  7,020   $  8,152   $  6,896   $  7,896  ##TABLE_END The Company determined the fair value of the long term receivables by discounting based upon the terms of the receivable and counterparty details including credit quality. As such, the fair value of these receivables is considered level 2. The Company determined the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities utilizing transactions in the listed markets for identical or similar liabilities. As such, the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities is considered level 2 as well. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had nonfinancial assets, specifically property, plant and equipment, software and intangible assets, with a net book value of $22 million and $262 million, respectively, which were accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets were tested for impairment and based on the fair value of these assets the Company recognized losses of $22 million and $127 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, primarily in connection with our repositioning actions (see Note 3 Repositioning and Other Charges). The Company has determined that the fair value measurements of these nonfinancial assets are level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company utilizes the market, income or cost approaches or a combination of these valuation techniques for its non-recurring level 3 fair value measures. Inputs to such measures include observable market data obtained from independent sources such as broker quotes and recent market transactions for similar assets. It is the Companys policy to maximize the use of observable inputs in the measurement of fair value or non-recurring level 3 measurements. To the extent observable inputs are not available the Company utilizes unobservable inputs based upon HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) the assumptions market participants would use in valuing the asset. Examples of utilized unobservable inputs are future cash flows, long term growth rates and applicable discount rates.

Foreign currency exchange contracts in cash flow hedge relationships qualify as critical matched terms hedge relationships and as a result have no ineffectiveness. Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or (losses) on the derivative recognized in Interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt being hedged. Gains on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $12 and $112 million in the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 respectively. Gains and losses are fully offset by losses and gains on the underlying debt being hedged. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) We also economically hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts. These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged.

The 2011 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (the Plan) was approved by the shareowners at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners effective on April 26, 2011. Following approval of the Plan on April 26, 2011 we have not and will not grant any new awards to key employees under any previously existing stock-based compensation plans. There were 32,796,373 shares available for future grants under the terms of the Plan at December 31, 2012. Additionally, under the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (the Directors Plan) there were 186,933 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grant as of December 31, 2012. Stock Options The exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under our stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Committee of the Board. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of our stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employees requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The expected term represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Compensation cost on a pre-tax basis related to stock options recognized in operating results (included in selling, general and administrative expenses) in 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $65, $59 and $55 million, respectively.

The total intrinsic value of options (which is the amount by which the stock price exceeded the exercise price of the options on the date of exercise) exercised during 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $202, $164 and $54 million, respectively. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $305, $290 and $181 million, respectively, with an associated tax benefit realized of $74, $54 and $18 million, respectively. In 2012, 2011 and 2010 we classified $56, $42 and $13 million, respectively, of this benefit as a financing cash inflow in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and the balance was classified as cash from operations. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) At December 31, 2012 there was $123 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock option awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.38 years. The total fair value of options vested during 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $63, $52 and $41 million, respectively. Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock unit (RSU) awards entitle the holder to receive one share of common stock for each unit when the units vest. RSUs are issued to certain key employees at fair market value at the date of grant as compensation. RSUs typically become fully vested over periods ranging from three to seven years and are payable in Honeywell common stock upon vesting. The following table summarizes information about RSU activity for the three years ended December 31, 2012: ##TABLE_START        Number of Restricted Stock Units  Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Non-vested at December 31, 2009   8,262,777   $  40.49  Granted   3,842,367    42.33  Vested   (1,593,979 )    48.71  Forfeited   (537,212 )    40.45       Non-vested at December 31, 2010   9,973,953    39.89  Granted   1,887,733    55.11  Vested   (1,509,528 )    49.48  Forfeited   (605,725 )    40.11       Non-vested at December 31, 2011   9,746,433    41.35  Granted   2,156,753    59.52  Vested   (3,380,251 )    31.84  Forfeited   (427,196 )    45.78       Non-vested at December 31, 2012   8,095,739   $  49.91       ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2012, there was approximately $185 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs granted under our stock plans which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years. Compensation expense related to RSUs was $105, $109 and $109 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Non-Employee Directors Plan Under the Directors Plan each new non-employee director receives a one-time grant of 3,000 restricted stock units that will vest on the fifth anniversary of continuous Board service. In 2011, each non-employee director received an annual grant to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock at the fair market value on the date of grant. In 2012, the annual equity grant changed from a fixed number of shares to a target value of $75,000 and consists of 50 percent options and 50 percent RSUs. Options become exercisable over a four-year period and expire after ten years. RSUs generally vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant. Note 21Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest As discussed in Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures, on October 22, 2012, the Company acquired a 70 percent controlling interest in Thomas Russell Co. During the calendar year 2016, Honeywell has the right to acquire and the noncontrolling shareholder has the right to sell to Honeywell the remaining 30 percent interest at a price based on a multiple of Thomas Russell Co.s average annual operating income from 2013 to 2015, subject to a predetermined cap and floor. Additionally, Honeywell has the right to acquire the remaining 30 percent interest for a fixed price equivalent to the cap at any time on HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) or before December 31, 2015. Noncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as the arrangement described above, that are not solely within the Companys control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. Redeemable noncontrolling interest is considered temporary equity and is therefore reported outside of permanent equity on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at the greater of the initial carrying amount adjusted for the noncontrolling interests share of net income (loss) or its redemption value. As of December 31, 2012, the redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest approximated the carrying value. Note 22Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded liabilities for environmental costs: ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2012  2011  2010 Beginning of year  $    $    $   Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable   234    240    225  Environmental liability payments   (320 )    (270 )    (266 )  Other   17        15         End of year  $    $    $          ##TABLE_END 94 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that these environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. New Jersey Chrome Sites The excavation and offsite disposal of approximately one million tons of chromium residue present at a predecessor Honeywell site located in Jersey City, New Jersey, known as Study Area 7, was completed in January 2010. We are also implementing related groundwater remedial actions, and are conducting related river sediment work. In addition, remedial investigations and related activities are underway at other sites in Hudson County, New Jersey that allegedly have chromium contamination, and for which Honeywell has accepted responsibility in whole or in part. Provisions have been made in our financial statements for the estimated cost of investigations and implementation of these remedies consistent with the accounting policy described above. We do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or operating cash flows. Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, NY We are implementing a combined dredging/capping remedy of Onondaga Lake pursuant to a consent decree approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York in January 2007. We have accrued for our estimated cost of remediating Onondaga Lake based on currently available information and analysis performed by our engineering consultants. Honeywell is also conducting remedial investigations and activities at other sites in Syracuse. We have recorded reserves for these investigations and activities where appropriate consistent with the accounting policy described above. Honeywell has entered into a cooperative agreement with potential natural resource trustees to assess alleged natural resource damages relating to this site. It is not possible to predict the outcome or duration of this assessment, or the amounts of, or responsibility for, any damages. Asbestos Matters Like many other industrial companies, Honeywell is a defendant in personal injury actions related to asbestos. We did not mine or produce asbestos, nor did we make or sell insulation products or other construction materials that have been identified as the primary cause of asbestos related disease in the vast majority of claimants. Honeywells predecessors owned North American Refractories Company (NARCO) from 1979 to 1986. NARCO produced refractory products (bricks and cement used in high temperature applications). We sold the NARCO business in 1986 and agreed to indemnify NARCO with respect to personal injury claims for products that had been discontinued prior to the sale (as defined in the sale agreement). NARCO retained all liability for all other claims. NARCO and/or Honeywell are defendants in asbestos personal injury cases asserting claims based upon alleged exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products. Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing refractory products in an occupational setting. These claims, and the HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) filing of subsequent claims, have been stayed continuously since January 4, 2002, the date on which NARCO sought bankruptcy protection (see discussion below). Honeywells Bendix friction materials (Bendix) business manufactured automotive brake parts that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form. Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of individuals who performed brake replacements. The following tables summarize information concerning NARCO and Bendix asbestos related balances: Asbestos Related Liabilities ##TABLE_START                      Year Ended December 31,  Year Ended December 31,  Year Ended December 31,  2012  2011  2010  Bendix  NARCO  Total  Bendix  NARCO  Total  Bendix  NARCO  Total Beginning of year  $    $  1,123   $  1,736   $    $  1,125   $  1,719   $    $  1,128   $  1,694  Accrual for update to estimated liability   168    (1 )    167    167    3    170    162    3    165  Change in estimated cost of future claims   30        30    16        16    16        16  Update of expected resolution values for pending claims   8        8    2        2    7        7  Asbestos related liability payments   (166 )    (3 )    (169 )    (166 )    (5 )    (171 )    (157 )    (6 )    (163 )                     End of year  $    $  1,119   $  1,772   $    $  1,123   $  1,736   $    $  1,125   $  1,719                     ##TABLE_END Insurance Recoveries for Asbestos Related Liabilities ##TABLE_START                      Year Ended December 31,  Year Ended December 31,  Year Ended December 31,  2012  2011  2010  Bendix  NARCO  Total  Bendix  NARCO  Total  Bendix  NARCO  Total Beginning of year  $    $    $    $    $    $    $    $    $  1,003  Probable insurance recoveries related to estimated liability   28        28    29        29    26        26  Insurance receipts for asbestos related liabilities   (60 )    (62 )    (122 )    (34 )    (100 )    (134 )    (41 )    (100 )    (141 )  Insurance receivables settlements and write offs   8    13    21    10        10        (13 )    (13 )                     End of year  $    $    $    $    $    $    $    $    $                      ##TABLE_END NARCO and Bendix asbestos related balances are included in the following balance sheet accounts: ##TABLE_START        December 31,  2012  2011 Other current assets  $    $   Insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities   663    709        $    $        Accrued liabilities  $    $   Asbestos related liabilities   1,292    1,499         $  1,772   $  1,736       ##TABLE_END 96 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) NARCO Products On January 4, 2002, NARCO filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In connection with the filing of NARCOs petition in 2002, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania (the Bankruptcy Court) issued an injunction staying the prosecution of NARCO-related asbestos claims against the Company, which stay has continuously remained in place. In November 2007, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed NARCOs Third Amended Plan of Reorganization (NARCO Plan of Reorganization). All challenges to the NARCO Plan of Reorganization were fully resolved in the third quarter of 2010. The NARCO Plan of Reorganization cannot become effective, however, until the Plan of Reorganization of certain NARCO affiliates, which is pending in Bankruptcy Court, is confirmed and then affirmed by the District Court. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of the Bankruptcy and District Court proceedings in the affiliates case. We expect that the stay enjoining litigation against NARCO and Honeywell will remain in effect until the effective date of the NARCO Plan of Reorganization. In connection with NARCOs bankruptcy filing, we agreed to certain obligations which will be triggered upon the effective date of the NARCO Plan of Reorganization. Honeywell will provide NARCO with $20 million in financing and simultaneously forgive such indebtedness. We will also pay $40 million to NARCOs former parent company and $16 million to certain asbestos claimants whose claims were resolved during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings. These amounts are expected to be paid during the first year of trust operations. When the NARCO Plan of Reorganization becomes effective, in connection with its implementation, a federally authorized 524(g) trust (NARCO Trust) will be established for the evaluation and resolution of all existing and future NARCO asbestos claims. When the NARCO Trust is established, both Honeywell and NARCO will be entitled to a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based on exposure to NARCO products to be made against the Trust. The NARCO Trust will review submitted claims and determine award amounts in accordance with established Trust Distribution Procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court which set forth all criteria claimants must meet to qualify for compensation including, among other things, exposure and medical criteria that determine the award amount. Once the NARCO Trust is established and operational, Honeywell will be obligated to fund NARCO asbestos claims submitted to the trust which qualify for payment under the Trust Distribution Procedures, subject to annual caps up to $150 million in any year, provided, however, that the first $100 million of claims processed through the NARCO Trust (the Initial Claims Amount) will not count against the first year annual cap and any unused portion of the Initial Claims Amount will roll over to subsequent years until fully utilized. Once the NARCO Trust is established and operational, Honeywell will also be responsible for the following funding obligations which are not subject to the annual cap described above: a) previously approved payments due to claimants pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings which provide that a portion of these settlements is to be paid by the NARCO Trust, which amounts are estimated at $130 million and are expected to be paid during the first year of trust operations and, b) payments due to claimants pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and Trust Distribution Procedures criteria, which amounts are estimated at $150 million and are expected to be paid during the first two years of trust operations. Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for the amounts discussed above, unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection and for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust through 2018. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims since HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) January 2002, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. In the absence of actual trust experience on which to base the estimate, Honeywell projected the probable value, including trust claim handling costs, of asbestos related future liabilities based on Company specific and general asbestos claims filing rates, expected rates of disease and anticipated claim values. Specifically, the valuation methodology included an analysis of the population likely to have been exposed to asbestos containing products, epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases, NARCO asbestos claims filing history, general asbestos claims filing rates in the tort system and in certain operating asbestos trusts, and the claims experience in those forums, the pending inventory of NARCO asbestos claims, disease criteria and payment values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures and an estimated approval rate of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust. This methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims has been commonly accepted by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts and resulted in a range of estimated liability for future claims of $743 to $961 million. We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. Our insurance receivable corresponding to the estimated liability for pending and future NARCO asbestos claims reflects coverage which reimburses Honeywell for portions of NARCO-related indemnity and defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. At December 31, 2012, a significant portion of this coverage is with insurance companies with whom we have agreements to pay full policy limits. We conduct analyses to determine the amount of insurance that we estimate is probable of recovery in relation to payment of current and estimated future claims. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. We made judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings with our insurers, our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers and various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs. In 2006, Travelers Casualty and Insurance Company (Travelers) filed a declaratory judgment action in the Supreme Court of New York, County of New York against Honeywell and other insurance carriers that provide coverage for NARCO asbestos claims, seeking a declaration regarding coverage obligations for NARCO asbestos claims under high excess insurance coverage issued by Travelers and the other insurance carriers. The other insurance carriers asserted cross claims against Honeywell seeking declarations regarding their coverage obligations for NARCO asbestos claims under high excess insurance coverage issued by them. Since then, the Company has entered into settlement agreements resolving all NARCO-related asbestos coverage issues with almost all of these insurance carriers, including Travelers. Honeywell believes it is entitled to the remaining coverage at issue. While Honeywell expects to prevail in this matter, an adverse outcome is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or operating cash flows. Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the NARCO related asbestos liabilities or assets to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. There is no assurance that the plan of reorganization will become final, that insurance recoveries will be timely or whether there will be any NARCO related asbestos claims beyond 2018. Given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future events, we review our estimates periodically, and update them based on our experience and other relevant factors. Similarly, we will reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability or other developments that may impact insurance recoveries.

Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of pending (claims actually filed as of the financial statement date) and future Bendix related asbestos claims. We have valued Bendix pending and future claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix pending and future claims during the fourth quarter each year. The liability for future claims represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury claims expected to be asserted against Bendix over the next five years. Such estimated cost of future Bendix related asbestos claims is based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. The methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims is similar to that used to estimate the future NARCO related asbestos claims liability. Our insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of pending and future Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the solvency of our insurers, our interpretation of judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with our insurers. Insurance receivables are also recorded when structured insurance settlements provide for future fixed payment streams that are not contingent upon future claims or other events. Such amounts are recorded at the net present value of the fixed payment stream. On a cumulative historical basis, Honeywell has recorded insurance receivables equal to approximately 38 percent of the value of the underlying asbestos claims recorded. However, because there are gaps in our coverage due to insurance company insolvencies, certain uninsured periods, and insurance settlements, this rate is expected to decline for any future Bendix related asbestos liabilities that may be recorded. Future recoverability rates may also be impacted by numerous other factors, such as future insurance settlements, insolvencies and judicial determinations relevant to our coverage program, which are difficult to predict. Assuming continued defense and indemnity spending at current levels, we estimate that the cumulative recoverability rate could decline over the next five years to approximately 31 percent. Honeywell believes it has sufficient insurance coverage and reserves to cover all pending Bendix related asbestos claims and Bendix related asbestos claims estimated to be filed within the next five years. Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of either pending or future Bendix related asbestos claims, we do not believe that such claims would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position in light of our insurance coverage and our prior experience in resolving such claims. If the rate and types of claims filed, the average resolution value of such claims and the period of time over which claim settlements are paid (collectively, the Variable Claims Factors) do not substantially change, Honeywell would not expect future Bendix related asbestos claims to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in any fiscal year. No assurances can be given, however, that the Variable Claims Factors will not change. Other Matters We are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Included in these other matters are the following: Allen, et al. v. Honeywell Retirement Earnings Plan Pursuant to a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona in February 2008, 18 of 21 claims alleged by plaintiffs in this class action lawsuit were dismissed with prejudice in exchange for approximately $35 million (paid from the Companys pension plan) and the maximum aggregate liability for the remaining three claims (alleging that Honeywell impermissibly reduced the pension benefits of certain employees of a predecessor entity when the plan was amended in 1983 and failed to calculate benefits in accordance with the terms of the plan) was capped at $500 million. In October 2009, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Honeywell Retirement Earnings Plan with respect to the claim regarding the calculation of benefits. In May 2011, the parties engaged in mediation and reached an agreement in principle to settle the three remaining claims for $23.8 million (also to be paid from the Companys pension plan). The Court approved the settlement on July 20, 2012 and all claims in this matter are now fully resolved. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Quick Lube On March 31, 2008, SE Quick Lube, a filter distributor, filed suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut alleging that twelve filter manufacturers, including Honeywell, engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices, rig bids and allocate U.S. customers for aftermarket automotive filters. This suit is a purported class action on behalf of direct purchasers of filters from the defendants. Parallel purported class actions, including on behalf of indirect purchasers of filters, have been filed by other plaintiffs in a variety of jurisdictions in the United States and Canada. The U.S cases have been consolidated into a single multi-district litigation in the Northern District of Illinois. In June 2011, plaintiffs principal witness pled guilty to a felony count of having made false statements to federal investigators. On March 8, 2012, Honeywell entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the multi-district litigation class action as to all plaintiffs. On October 10, 2012 and November 28, 2012, the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois issued orders granting final approval of the U.S. multi-district litigation settlement as to all plaintiffs. As previously reported, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice notified Honeywell in January 2010 that it had officially closed its investigation into possible collusion in the replacement auto filters industry. The class action in Canada is still pending but we do not expect the resolution to have a material impact on our results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. Honeywell v. United Auto Workers (UAW) et. al In July 2011, Honeywell filed an action in federal court (District of New Jersey) against the UAW and all former employees who retired under a series of Master Collective Bargaining Agreements (MCBAs) between Honeywell and the UAW. The Company is seeking a declaratory judgment that certain express limitations on its obligation to contribute toward the healthcare coverage of such retirees (the CAPS) set forth in the MCBAs may be implemented, effective January 1, 2012. In September 2011, the UAW and certain retiree defendants filed a motion to dismiss the New Jersey action and filed suit in the Eastern District of Michigan alleging that the MCBAs do not provide for CAPS on the Companys liability for healthcare coverage. The UAW and retiree plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for class certification and a motion for partial summary judgment in the Michigan action, seeking a ruling that retirees who retired prior to the initial inclusion of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA are not covered by the CAPS as a matter of law. In December 2011, the New Jersey action was dismissed on forum grounds. Honeywell appealed the New Jersey courts dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The Third Circuit denied the appeal. Honeywell has now answered the UAWs complaint in Michigan and has asserted a counterclaim for fraudulent inducement. Honeywell is confident that the CAPS will be upheld and that its liability for healthcare coverage premiums with respect to the putative class will be limited as negotiated and expressly set forth in the applicable MCBAs. In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywells other postretirement benefits for pre-2003 retirees would increase by approximately $175 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS. Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations (including the specific matters referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above). Considering our past experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Warranties and Guarantees We have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at December 31, 2012: ##TABLE_START           Maximum Potential Future Payments Operating lease residual values   $   Other third parties financing    5   Unconsolidated affiliates financing    12   Customer financing    9        $      ##TABLE_END We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination, if any, existing on the date of disposition. Such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In the normal course of business we issue product warranties and product performance guarantees. We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale. Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties and guarantees are made as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Note 23Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. Pension benefits for substantially all U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. U.S. defined benefit pension plans comprise 76 percent of our projected benefit obligation. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywells U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Non-U.S. employees, who are not U.S. citizens, are covered by various retirement benefit arrangements, some of which are considered to be defined benefit pension plans for accounting purposes. Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans comprise 24 percent of our projected benefit obligation. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage to eligible retirees. Our retiree medical plans mainly cover U.S. employees who retire with pension eligibility for prescription drug, hospital, professional and other medical services. Most of the U.S. retiree medical plans require deductibles and copayments, and virtually all are integrated with Medicare. Retiree contributions are generally required based on coverage type, plan and Medicare eligibility. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell after January 1, 2000 are not eligible to participate in our retiree medical and life insurance plans. Less than 5 percent of Honeywells U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company; and this subsidy is limited to a fixed-dollar amount. In addition, more than half of Honeywells current retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. In 2011, in connection with new collective bargaining agreements reached with several of its union groups, Honeywell amended its U.S. retiree medical plans eliminating the subsidy for those union employees resulted in curtailment gains totaling $167 million. The curtailment gains represented the recognition in net periodic postretirement benefit cost of prior service credits attributable to the future years of service of the union groups for which future accrual of benefits was eliminated. In 2010, Honeywell amended its U.S. retiree medical plan to no longer offer certain post-age-65 retirees Honeywell group coverage and facilitate their purchase of an individual plan in the Medicare marketplace. This plan amendment reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $137 million which will be recognized as part of net periodic postretirement benefit cost over the average future service period to full eligibility of the remaining active union employees still eligible for a retiree medical subsidy. Also in 2010, in connection with a new collective bargaining agreement reached with one of its union groups, Honeywell amended its U.S. retiree medical plan eliminating the subsidy for those union employees who retire after February 1, 2013. This plan amendment reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $39 million which will be recognized as part of net periodic postretirement benefit cost over the average future service period to full eligibility of the remaining active union employees still eligible for a retiree medical subsidy. This plan amendment also resulted in a curtailment gain of $37 million in 2010 which represented the recognition in net periodic postretirement benefit cost of prior service credits attributable to the future years of service of the union group for which future accrual of benefits was eliminated. The following tables summarize the balance sheet impact, including the benefit obligations, assets and funded status associated with our significant pension and other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2012 and 2011.

To determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments. We use the average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Our expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations. We will use an expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 7.75 percent for 2013 down from 8 percent for 2012 due to lower future expected market returns. We review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. For non-U.S. benefit plans, none of which was individually material, assumptions reflect economic assumptions applicable to each country. Pension Benefits Included in the aggregate data in the tables above are the amounts applicable to our pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets. Amounts related to such plans were as follows: ##TABLE_START            December 31,  U.S. Plans  Non-U.S. Plans  2012  2011  2012  2011 Projected benefit obligation  $  17,117   $  15,600   $  4,670   $  4,141  Accumulated benefit obligation  $  16,288   $  14,845   $  4,426   $  3,912  Fair value of plan assets  $  14,345   $  12,836   $  3,837   $  3,367  ##TABLE_END Accumulated benefit obligation for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $16.3 and $14.8 billion and our Non-U.S. defined benefit plans were $5.0 and $4.4 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our asset investment strategy for our U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve our long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. Our actual invested positions in various securities change over time based on short and longer- term investment opportunities. To achieve our objectives, we have established long-term target allocations as follows: 60-70 percent equity securities, 10-20 percent fixed income securities and cash, 5-15 percent real estate investments, and 10-20 percent other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located both inside and outside the United States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies. We review our assets on a regular basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations. Our non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing standard funding and investment guidance. Local regulations, local funding rules, and local financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. While our non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country, the long-term investment objectives are generally the same as those for the U.S. pension assets. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Our non-U.S. pension assets at December 31, 2012 include $55 million in notional derivative exposure primarily related to outstanding equity futures contracts. The Company enters into futures contracts to gain exposure to certain markets. Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgages, asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in commingled funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals. Our general funding policy for qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans, however, we made voluntary contributions of $792, $1,650 and $1,000 million, respectively, primarily to improve the funded status of our plans. These contributions do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets. In 2013, we expect to make cash contributions of approximately $150 million ($113 million was made in January 2013) to our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. We do not have any required contributions for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2013. Benefit payments, including amounts to be paid from Company assets, and reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows: ##TABLE_START        U.S. Plans  Non-U.S. Plans  $  1,043   $   2014   1,045    200  2015   1,087    205  2016   1,075    210  2017   1,071    215  2018-2022   5,448    1,162  ##TABLE_END Other Postretirement Benefits The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) provides subsidies for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug coverage that is at least actuarially equivalent to that offered by Medicare Part D. The March 2010 enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including modifications made in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 resulted in a one-time, non-cash charge of $13 million related to income taxes in the first quarter of 2010. The charge results from a change in the tax treatment of the Medicare Part D program. ##TABLE_START        December 31,  2012  2011 Assumed health care cost trend rate:     Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year   7.00 %    7.50 %  Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to   5.00 %    5.00 %  Year that the rate reaches the rate it is assumed to remain at   2019    2017  ##TABLE_END The assumed health care cost trend rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and the financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey February 15, 2013 ", "9A": " Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Honeywell management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K to ensure information required to be disclosed in the reports that Honeywell files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and our Controller, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There have been no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Honeywells internal control over financial reporting that have occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2012. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Honeywell management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Honeywells internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Honeywells internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Honeywells assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Honeywells management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Honeywells assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of Honeywells internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management determined that Honeywell maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. The effectiveness of Honeywells internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8.

(the 2006 Non-Employee Director Plan) and the 1994 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (the 1994 Non-Employee Director Plan) (335,334 shares of Common Stock to be issued for options; and 14,733 RSUs subject to continued services). RSUs included in column (a) of the table represent the full number of RSUs awarded and outstanding whereas the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon vesting will be lower than what is reflected on the table due to the net share settlement process used by the Company (whereas the value of shares required to meet employee statutory minimum tax withholding requirements are not issued).     1,092,801 growth plan units were issued for the performance cycle commencing on January 1, 2010 and ending December 31, 2011 pursuant to the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. The second and final payment related to these growth plan units will be paid in March 2013. 1,535,800 growth plan units were issued for the performance cycle commencing January 1, 2012 and ending December 31, 2013 pursuant to the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan. 50% of the payment related to these growth plan units, if any, will be paid in March 2014 and the remaining 50% will be paid in March 2015, subject to active employment on the payment dates.     The ultimate value of any growth plan award may be paid in cash or shares of Common Stock and, thus, growth plan units are not included in the table above. The ultimate value of growth plan units depends upon the achievement of pre-established performance goals during the two-year performance cycle.     Because the number of future shares that may be distributed to employees participating in the Honeywell Global Stock Plan is unknown, no shares attributable to that plan are included in column (a) of the table above. (2)    Column (b) relates to stock options and does not include any exercise price for RSUs or growth plan units granted to employees or non-employee directors under equity compensation plans approved by shareowners. RSUs do not have an exercise price because their value is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals or continued employment or service and they are settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. Growth plan units are denominated in cash units and the ultimate value of the award is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals. (3)    The number of shares that may be issued under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2012 is 32,796,373 which includes the following additional shares under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (or any Prior Plan as defined in the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan) that may again be available for issuance: shares that are settled for cash, expire, are canceled, are tendered in satisfaction of an option exercise price or tax withholding obligations, are reacquired with cash tendered in satisfaction of an option exercise price or with monies attributable to any tax deduction enjoyed by Honeywell to the exercise of an option, and are under any outstanding awards assumed under any equity compensation plan of an entity acquired by Honeywell. No securities are available for future issuance under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, the 1993 Stock Plan, or the 1994 Non-Employee Director Plan.     The number of shares that may be issued under the Honeywell Global Stock Plan as of December 31, 2012 is 2,225,764. This plan is an umbrella plan for four plans maintained solely for eligible employees of participating non-U.S. countries. More than 50% of the shares distributed under the Honeywell Global Stock Plan have been distributed to participants in one sub-plan, the Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of February 1, 2013, the Global Employee Stock Purchase ##TABLE_END 121 ##TABLE_START    Plan was terminated and all shares remaining in the plan on that date were transferred to direct registration accounts maintained by the Corporations stock transfer agent. 20,692 Company matching shares awarded to participants in 2009 vested in November 2012, and an additional 17,506 shares were credited to participants accounts as a result of dividend reinvestment.     Another sub-plan of the Honeywell Global Stock Plan, the UK Sharebuilder Plan, allows an eligible UK employee to contribute a specified percentage of their taxable earnings that is then invested in shares. The Company matches those shares and dividends paid are used to purchase additional shares of Common Stock. The match share percentage for 2012 was 62.50%. Matched shares are subject to a three-year vesting schedule. Shares taken out of the plan before five years lose their tax-favored status. For the year ending December 31, 2012, 100,678 shares were credited to participants accounts under the UK Sharebuilder Plan.     The remaining two sub-plans of the Honeywell Global Stock Plan, the Honeywell International Technologies Employees Share Ownership Plan (Ireland) and the Honeywell Measurex (Ireland) Limited Group Employee Profit Sharing Scheme, allow eligible employees in Ireland to contribute specified percentages of base pay, bonus or performance pay that are then invested in Common Stock. Shares must be held in trust for at least two years and lose their tax-favored status if they are taken out of the plan before three years. For the year ending December 31, 2012, 19,712 shares of Common Stock were credited to participants accounts under these two plans.     The remaining 186,933 shares included in column (c) are shares remaining for future grants under the 2006 Non-Employee Director Plan. (4)    Equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners that are included in the table are the Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees of Honeywell International Inc. and its Subsidiaries, and the AlliedSignal Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Employees of AlliedSignal Inc. and its Subsidiaries.     The Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees of Honeywell International Inc. and its Subsidiaries is an unfunded, non-tax qualified plan that provides benefits equal to the employee deferrals and company matching allocations that would have been provided under Honeywells U.S. tax-qualified savings plan if the Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and contributions did not apply. The Company matching contribution is credited to participants accounts in the form of notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of Common Stock when payments are made to participants under the plan. The number of shares to be issued under this plan based on the value of the notional shares as of December 31, 2012 is 565,113.     The AlliedSignal Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Employees of AlliedSignal Inc. and its Subsidiaries was a cash incentive compensation plan maintained by AlliedSignal Inc. This plan has expired. Employees were permitted to defer receipt of a cash bonus payable under the plan and invest the deferred bonus in notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of Common Stock when payments are made to participants under the plan. No further deferrals can be made under this plan. The number of shares of Common Stock that remain to be issued under this expired plan as of December 31, 2012 is 29,566.     The Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. provides for mandatory and elective deferral of certain payments to non-employee directors. Mandatory deferrals are invested in notional shares of Common Stock. Directors may also invest any elective deferrals in notional shares of Common Stock. Because the notional shares are distributed in the form of cash when payments are made to directors under the plan, they are not included in the table above. (5)    Column (b) does not include any exercise price for notional shares allocated to employees under Honeywells equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners because all of these shares are notionally allocated as a matching contribution under the non-tax qualified savings plans or as a notional investment of deferred bonuses or fees under the cash incentive compensation and directors plans as described in note 4 and are only settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. ##TABLE_END 122 ##TABLE_START (6)    No securities are available for future issuance under the AlliedSignal Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Employees of AlliedSignal Inc. and its Subsidiaries and the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. The cash incentive compensation plan has expired. All notional investments in shares of Common Stock are converted to cash when payments are made under the directors plan. The amount of securities available for future issuance under the Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees of Honeywell International Inc. and its Subsidiaries is not determinable because the number of securities that may be issued under this plan depends upon the amount deferred to the plan by participants in future years.     The table does not contain information for employee benefit plans of Honeywell that are intended to meet the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and a small number of foreign employee benefit plans that are similar to such Section 401(a) plans. ##TABLE_END ", "13": " Item 13.

Our sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers were 7, 7, and 6 percent of our total sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 11, 12, and 11 percent of our total sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011. Our Aerospace results of operations can be impacted by various industry and economic conditions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. U.S. Government Sales Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by our Aerospace segment), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $3,856, $4,109 and $4,276 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a prime contractor and subcontractor, of $3,066, $3,273 and $3,374 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. U.S. defense spending decreased in 2013 compared to 2012. Due to anticipated lower U.S. Government spending levels mandated by the Budget Control Act (sequestration), we expect a slight decline in our defense and space revenue in 2014. We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2014 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEM production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs), increases in direct foreign defense and space market sales, as well as our diversified commercial businesses. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to audits, investigations, and termination by the government. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. Backlog Our total backlog at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $16,523 and $16,307 million, respectively. We anticipate that approximately $12,262 million of the 2013 backlog will be filled in 2014. We believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option. Competition We are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas. Competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions. Competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us, and vary by country. Our businesses compete on a variety of factors, such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. A number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies, some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers. See Item 1A Risk Factors for further discussion. International Operations We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development globally. U.S. exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 14, 14 and 12 percent of our total sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Foreign manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 41, 41 and 43 percent of our total sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Approximately 23 percent of total 2013 sales of Aerospace-related products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products and systems and performance of services such as aircraft repair and overhaul. Exports were principally made to Europe, Asia, Canada, and Latin America. Foreign manufactured products and systems and performance of services comprised approximately 16 percent of total 2013 Aerospace sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Canada and Asia. Approximately 3 percent of total 2013 sales of Automation and Control Solutions products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Foreign manufactured products and performance of services accounted for 57 percent of total 2013 Automation and Control Solutions sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe and Asia, with less significant operations in Canada and Australia. Approximately 30 percent of total 2013 sales of Performance Materials and Technologies products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Exports were principally made to Asia and Latin America. Foreign manufactured products and performance of services comprised 23 percent of total 2013 Performance Materials and Technologies sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe and Asia. Approximately 4 percent of total 2013 sales of Transportation Systems products were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Foreign manufactured products accounted for 84 percent of total 2013 sales of Transportation Systems. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Asia. Financial information including net sales and long-lived assets related to geographic areas is included in Note 25 of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Information regarding the economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international operations is included in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Raw Materials The principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available. Although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply, we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials and commodities in 2013. We are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials, except related to R240 (a key component in foam blowing agents), a raw material used in our Performance Materials and Technologies segment. The costs of certain key raw materials, including cumene, fluorspar, R240, natural gas, perchloroethylene, sulfur and ethylene in our Performance Materials and Technologies business, nickel, steel and other metals in our Transportation Systems business, and nickel, titanium and other metals in our Aerospace business, are expected to continue to fluctuate. We will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2014. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion. Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. We own, or are licensed under, a large number of patents, patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years, which relate to many of our products or improvements to those products and which are of importance to our business. From time to time, new patents and trademarks are obtained, and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others. We also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and services produced by other companies. In our judgment, those rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any patent, trademark or related group of patents, or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product, to be of material importance in relation to our total business. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion. We have registered trademarks for a number of our products and services, including Honeywell, Aclar, Ademco, Bendix, BW, Callidus, Enovate, Esser, Fire-Lite, Garrett, Genetron, Gent, Howard Leight, Intermec, Jurid, Matrikon, Maxon, MK, North, Notifier, Novar, Oleflex, Parex, RAE Systems, RMG, Silent Knight, Solstice, Spectra, System Sensor, Trend, Tridium and UOP. Research and Development Our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of new products, technologies and processes, and the development of new uses for existing products and software applications. The Companys principal research and development activities are in the U.S., India, Europe and China. Research and development (RD) expense totaled $1,804, $1,847 and $1,799 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decrease in RD expense of 2 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to lower pension (primarily due to the absence of U.S. pension mark-to-market adjustment in 2013) and other postretirement expenses, partially offset by the increased expenditures for new product development in our Automation and Control Solutions and Performance Materials Technologies segments. The increase in RD expense of 3 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 was mainly due to increased expenditures on the development of new technologies to support existing and new aircraft platforms in our Aerospace segment and new product development in our Automation and Control Solutions and Performance Materials Technologies segments. RD as a percentage of sales was 4.6, 4.9 and 4.9 percent in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Customer-sponsored (principally the U.S. Government) RD activities amounted to an additional $969, $835 and $867 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Environment We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. It is our policy to comply with these requirements, and we believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys Superfund priority list. Although, under some court interpretations of these laws, there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, to date we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole. We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Companys business or markets that it serves, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. Further information, including the current status of significant environmental matters and the financial impact incurred for remediation of such environmental matters, if any, is included in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Employees We have approximately 131,000 employees at December 31, 2013, of which approximately 51,000 were located in the United States. ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements We have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including the overview of the Company and each of our segments and the discussion of their respective economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2014. These sections and other parts of this report (including this Item 1A) contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. Risk Factors Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations. The operating results of our segments are impacted by general global industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns, demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing and shipping costs. The operating results of our Aerospace segment, which generated 31 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2013, are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production, the deferral or cancellation of orders for new aircraft, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft platforms, the retirement of aircraft, global flying hours, and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates, as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts, supplier consolidation, factory transitions, capacity constraints, and the level and mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs (as further discussed in other risk factors below). The challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including global flying hours, aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline consolidation, airline insolvencies, terrorism and safety concerns as well as changes in regulations. Future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our Aerospace aftermarket sales and margins. The operating results of our Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) segment, which generated 42 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2013, are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation, industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion, inventory levels in distribution channels, and global economic growth rates. Performance Materials and Technologies operating results, which generated 17 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2013, are impacted by global economic growth rates, capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, and raw material demand and supply volatility. Transportation Systems operating results, which generated 10 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2013, are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, and regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, delays in launch schedules for new automotive platforms, and consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products. Demand of global automotive and truck manufacturers will continue to be influenced by a wide variety of factors, including ability of consumers to obtain financing, ability to reduce operating costs and overall consumer and business confidence. Each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices (as further described below) and non- material inflation. Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities. The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in our Performance Materials and Technologies (cumene, fluorspar, R240, natural gas, perchloroethylene, sulfur and ethylene), Transportation Systems (nickel, steel and other metals) and Aerospace (nickel, titanium and other metals) segments. Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations. Our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials (including raw materials) by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components, and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions, quality standards, and applicable laws and regulations. In addition, many major components, product equipment items and raw materials are procured or subcontracted on a single-source basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies; in some circumstances these suppliers are the sole source of the component or equipment. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their non-performance. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by suppliers decisions to exit certain businesses, bankruptcy and by external events such as natural disasters, extreme weather events, pandemic health issues, terrorist actions, labor disputes, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes (e.g., product certification or stewardship requirements, sourcing restrictions, product authenticity, climate change or greenhouse gas emission standards, etc.). Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. Transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays, including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/or regulatory agencies. In addition, because our businesses cannot always immediately adapt their cost structure to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity for certain products may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements, which could adversely impact our operating costs, profitability and customer and supplier relationships. Our facilities, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to, among other things, fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, result in personal injury or property damage, damage relationships with our customers and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities or systems, as well as result in other liabilities and adverse impacts. The same risk could also arise from the failure of critical systems supplied by Honeywell to large industrial, refining and petrochemical customers. Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements through the Honeywell Enablers. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost- competitive regions and product line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to employee attrition. Many of the restructuring actions are complex and difficult to implement. Hence, we may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expected, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. See Note 3 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to the Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a summary of our repositioning actions. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins. Our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) develop and retain individuals with the requisite expertise. Our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources. These development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts. We own or are licensed under a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications, trademarks and copyrights. Our intellectual property rights may expire or be challenged, invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms. In some non-U.S. countries, laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application, which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights. Any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs, and/or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company and/or its third party service providers. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. Although we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations. Our international operations, including U.S. exports, comprise a growing proportion of our operating results. Our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets, including developing markets such as China, India, the Middle East and other high growth regions. In 2013, approximately 55 percent of our total sales (including products manufactured in the U.S. and sold outside the U.S. as well as products manufactured in international locations) were outside of the U.S. including approximately 29 percent in Europe and approximately 13 percent in Asia. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, government instability, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. We are also subject to U.S. laws prohibiting companies from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the type of business that may be conducted in these countries. The cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. With more than half of the Companys sales generated internationally, global economic conditions can have a significant impact on our total sales. Uncertain global economic conditions arising from a tepid recovery in the Euro zone and varying rates of growth in emerging regions could reduce customer confidence that results in decreased demand for our products and services, disruption in payment patterns and higher default rates, a tightening of credit markets (see risk factor below regarding volatility of credit markets for further discussion) and increased risk regarding supplier performance. Volatility in exchange rates of emerging market currencies present uncertainties that complicate planning and could unexpectedly impact our profitability, presenting increased counterparty risk with respect to the financial institutions with whom we do business. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the financial institutions with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the US dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the US dollar and may adversely affect our results of operations. Currency fluctuations may affect product demand and prices we pay for materials, as a result, our operating margins may be negatively impacted. Fluctuations in exchange rates may give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of our non-U.S. businesses are translated into U.S. dollars. While we monitor our exchange rate exposures and seek to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities, such activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or successful in significantly mitigating such volatility. Volatility of credit markets or macro-economic factors could adversely affect our business. Changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate volatility, may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. A decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing. Delays in our customers ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing to our customers, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. The inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could result in the need to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant incremental cost and delay, as discussed above. Lastly, disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets could impact the financial institutions with which we do business. We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our long-lived assets or available for sale investments. At December 31, 2013, the net carrying value of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) and available for sale securities totaled approximately $20.8 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other long-lived assets. An other than temporary decline in the market value of our available for sale securities may also result in an impairment charge. Future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareowners equity and increase our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, which could negatively impact our credit rating and access to the public debt and equity markets. A change in the level of U.S. Government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact Aerospaces defense and space sales and results of operations. Sales of our defense and space-related products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets, particularly the U.S. defense budget. Sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. Department of Defense comprised approximately 25 percent and 8 percent of Aerospace and total sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013. We cannot predict the extent to which total funding and/or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the 2014 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by Congress, or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations. We also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning and/or the nature of war-related activity on existing, follow-on or replacement programs. A shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate and/or reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations. As a supplier of military and other equipment to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unusual risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance. In addition to normal business risks, companies like Honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the U.S. Government are subject to unusual risks, including dependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds, changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments, significant changes in contract requirements, complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete, necessity for frequent design improvements, intense competition for U.S. Government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development, difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work, and other factors characteristic of the industry, such as contract award protests and delays in the timing of contract approvals. Changes are customary over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly development contracts, and generally result in adjustments to contract prices and schedules. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to various government audits. Like many other government contractors, we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts or changes to certain accounting systems or controls to comply with various government regulations. When appropriate and prudent, we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, plus termination costs and a reasonable profit. If a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for reprocurement costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and for other damages suffered by the government as permitted under the contract. We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. The U.S. Government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other egregious misconduct. Debarment generally does not exceed three years. Our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees, vendors, agents or business partners. We cannot ensure that our extensive compliance controls, policies and procedures will, in all instances, protect us from reckless, unethical or criminal acts committed by our employees, vendors, agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including laws governing payments to government officials, competition, data privacy and rights of employees. Any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, results of operations and reputation. Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations. Safety and performance regulations (including mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft), product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact Aerospace sales, research and development expenditures, operating costs and profitability. The demand for and cost of providing Automation and Control Solutions products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies results of operations can be affected by environmental (e.g. government regulation of fluorocarbons), safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations, while emissions, fuel economy and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our Transportation Systems segment. Honeywell sells products that address safety and environmental regulation and a substantial portion of our portfolio is dedicated to energy efficient products and services. Legislation or regulations regarding areas such as labor and employment, employee benefit plans, tax, health, safety and environmental matters, import, export and trade, intellectual property, product certification, and product liability may impact the results of each of our operating segments and our consolidated results. Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned, and divestitures may not occur as planned. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, (ii) the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities, (iii) the failure to integrate acquired businesses into Honeywell on schedule and/or to achieve synergies in the planned amount or within the expected timeframe, (iv) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected timeframe, and (v) the degree of protection provided by indemnities from sellers of acquired companies and the obligations under indemnities provided to purchasers of our divested businesses. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, import and export matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings. Moreover, our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. It also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition. Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We have incurred remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our expenses include significant costs related to employee and retiree health benefits. With approximately 131,000 employees, including approximately 51,000 in the U.S., our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health benefits are significant. In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs, largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control, in particular, ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation. Continued increasing health-care costs, legislative or regulatory changes, and volatility in discount rates, as well as changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health benefit expenses, may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and pension contributions in future periods. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. Funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans may become more significant. However, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. For a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to estimate pension expense, including discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies included in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. In 2013, our tax expense represented 26.8 percent of our income before tax. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures.

Environmental Matters Involving Potential Monetary Sanctions in Excess of $100,000 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has alleged that PreCon, Inc., a Honeywell service provider, failed to comply with certain environmental regulations at a Virginia facility. EPA has initially calculated the relevant penalty at approximately $180,000, although negotiations are ongoing. Honeywell includes this allegation because of its contractual relationship with PreCon, Inc. The EPA has made no allegations against Honeywell.

Market and dividend information for Honeywells common stock is included in Note 27 Unaudited Quarterly Financial Information of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The number of record holders of our common stock at December 31, 2013 was 55,537. Honeywell purchased 3,500,000 shares of its common stock, par value $1 per share, in the quarter ending December 31, 2013. In December 2013, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $5 billion of Honeywell common stock, which replaced the previously approved share repurchase program. $5 billion remained available as of December 31, 2013 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including future option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating, financing and other investing activities.

All references to Notes related to Notes to the Financial Statements in Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The Consumer Products Group (CPG) automotive aftermarket business had historically been part of the Transportation Systems reportable segment. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, CPG results are excluded from continuing operations and are presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures for further details. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY For Honeywell, 2013 marked another year of growth and enhanced profitability. Despite a modest 2.5 percent growth in World GDP and Industrial Production, Honeywells 2013 revenues were $39.1 billion representing a 4 percent improvement compared to 2012 revenues of $37.7 billion. Our segment profit improved by 8 percent, roughly two times revenue growth, evidencing the Companys continued focus on operational excellence. We achieved strong segment profit expansion while reinvesting in our businesses through seed planting and continued focus on proactive repositioning. See Review of Business Segments section of this MDA for a reconciliation of segment profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before taxes. The Companys operational excellence and ability to expand profit faster than sales growth is due in part to a consistent, methodical application of several key internal business processes which drive improvements in organizational efficiency and service quality, bringing world-class products and services to markets faster and more cost effectively for our customers. Honeywell refers to these processes as the Honeywell Enablers. In 2013, Honeywell continued to strengthen and expand the use of the Honeywell Enablers: ##TABLE_START    The Honeywell Operating System (HOS): HOS drives sustainable improvements in our manufacturing operations to generate exceptional performance in safety, quality, delivery, cost, and inventory management. Approximately 75 percent of our manufacturing cost base has achieved HOS certification.     Velocity Product Development (VPD): VPD is a process which brings together all of the functions necessary to successfully launch new productsRD, manufacturing, marketing and salesto increase the probability that in commercializing new technologies Honeywell delivers the right products at the right price.     Functional Transformation (FT): Functional Transformation is HOS for our administrative functionsFinance, Legal, HR, IT and Purchasingstandardizing the way we work, which improves service quality and reduces costs. ##TABLE_END The Company continues to invest for future growth as measured by a number of important metrics: ##TABLE_START    RD spending at 4.6 percent of revenues was targeted at such high growth areas as natural gas processing, low global warming refrigerants and blowing agents, and voice control and wireless control devices and technologies.     Capital expenditures grew 7 percent to $947 million principally related to the construction and expansion of Performance Materials and Technologies manufacturing facilities, as well as upgrades to our Aerospace facilities.     The Company recognized approximately $231 million of charges relating to restructuring actions to support sustainable productivity in years to come. ##TABLE_END 27 ##TABLE_START     The Company completed $1,133 million (net of cash acquired) in acquisitions in 2013, including the acquisition of Intermec, Inc. (Intermec), a leading provider of mobile computing, radio frequency identification solutions (RFID) and bar code, label and receipt printers for use in warehousing, supply chain, field service and manufacturing environments and RAE Systems, Inc. (RAE), a global manufacturer of fixed and portable gas and radiation detection systems, and software.     The Company continued to monitor its portfolio of businesses and to divest those that do not fit within our long-term strategic plan. In January 2014, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Friction Materials business for approximately $155 million. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Expansion of Honeywells presence and sales in high growth regions and countries such as China, India, Eastern Europe, the Middle-East, and Latin America. Sales to customers outside the United States now account for approximately 55 percent of total revenues. ##TABLE_END Operating cash flow grew by 23 percent in 2013 to $4,335 million. This operating cash flow performance enabled us to invest $947 million in capital expenditures, partially fund the acquisitions discussed above, make $156 million in non-U.S. pension contributions, provide a 10 percent increase in the Companys cash dividend rate (vs. 2012) and repurchase 13.5 million shares of common stock. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales ##TABLE_START          2013  2012  2011 Net sales  $  39,055   $  37,665   $  36,529  % change compared with prior period  4%  3%   ##TABLE_END The change in net sales compared to the prior year period is attributable to the following: ##TABLE_START        2013 Versus 2012  2012 Versus 2011 Volume   1 %    2 %  Price   1 %    1 %  Acquisitions/Divestitures   2 %    2 %  Foreign Exchange       (2 )%         4 %    3 %       ##TABLE_END A discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this MDA. Cost of Products and Services Sold ##TABLE_START          2013  2012  2011 Cost of products and services sold  $  28,364   $  28,291   $  28,556  % change compared with prior period    (1)%   Gross Margin percentage   27.4 %    24.9 %    21.8 %  ##TABLE_END Cost of products and services sold increased by $73 million in 2013 compared with 2012 principally due to an estimated increase in direct material costs of approximately $585 million and indirect material costs of approximately $115 million (driven by higher sales volume and acquisitions) and increased repositioning and other charges of approximately $140 million partially offset by a decrease in pension expense of approximately $760 million, primarily driven by the $650 million decrease in the pension mark-to-market adjustment allocated to cost of products and services sold (approximately $30 million in 2013 versus approximately $680 million in 2012). Gross margin percentage increased by 2.5 percentage points in 2013 compared with 2012 principally due to lower pension expense (approximately 2.0 percentage point impact primarily driven by the decrease in the pension mark-to-market adjustment allocated to cost of products and services sold), higher segment gross margin in all of our business segments (approximately 0.5 percentage point impact collectively) and lower other postretirement expense (0.1 percentage point impact) partially offset by higher repositioning and other charges (approximately 0.4 percentage point impact) Cost of products and services sold decreased by $265 million or 1 percent in 2012 compared with 2011, principally due to a decrease in pension expense of approximately $800 million (primarily driven by the decrease in the pension mark-to-market adjustment allocated to cost of products and services sold of $780 million) and a decrease in repositioning and other charges of approximately $220 million, partially offset by an estimated increase in direct material costs of approximately $620 million driven substantially by a 3 percent increase in sales as a result of the factors (excluding price) shown above and discussed in the Review of Business Segments section of this MDA and an increase in other postretirement expense of approximately $135 million due to the absence of 2011 curtailment gains. Gross margin percentage increased by 3.1 percentage points in 2012 compared with 2011 principally due to lower pension expense (approximately 2.2 percentage point impact primarily driven by the decrease in the pension mark-to-market adjustment allocated to cost of products and services sold), lower repositioning actions (approximately 0.6 percentage point impact) and higher segment gross margin in our Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions and Performance Materials and Technologies segments (approximately 0.4 percentage point impact collectively), partially offset by higher other postretirement expense (approximately 0.4 percentage point impact). Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ##TABLE_START          2013  2012  2011 Selling, general and administrative expense  $  5,190   $  5,218   $  5,399  Percent of sales  13.3%  13.9%  14.8% ##TABLE_END Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) decreased as a percentage of sales by 0.6 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily driven by (i) higher sales as a result of the factors discussed in the Review of Business Segments section of this MDA, (ii) an estimated $270 million decrease in pension expense primarily driven by an approximately $250 million decrease in the pension mark-to-market charge allocated to SGA (approximately $20 million in 2013 versus approximately $270 million in 2012) partially offset by an estimated $215 million increase in labor costs (primarily acquisitions, merit increases and investment for growth) and an $80 million increase in repositioning charges. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales by 0.9 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 driven by the impact of higher sales as a result of the factors discussed in the Review of Business Segments section of this MDA, an estimated $110 million decrease in pension expense (driven by the decrease in the portion of the pension mark-to-market charge allocated to SGA), $90 million decrease due to foreign exchange and $80 million decrease in repositioning actions, partially offset by the impact of an estimated $140 million increase in costs resulting from acquisitions, investment for growth and merit increases (net of other employee related costs). Other (Income) Expense ##TABLE_START          2013  2012  2011 Equity (income) loss of affiliated companies  $  (36 )   $  (45 )   $  (51 )  Gain on sale of available for sale investments   (195 )          Loss (gain) on sale of non-strategic businesses and assets   20    (5 )    (61 )  Interest income   (69 )    (58 )    (58 )  Foreign exchange   34    36    50  Other, net   8    2    36          $  (238 )   $  (70 )   $  (84 )         ##TABLE_END Other income increased by $168 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to $195 million of realized gain related to the sale of marketable equity securities. These securities (B/E Aerospace common stock), designated as available for sale, were obtained in conjunction with the sale of the Consumables Solutions business in July 2008. This gain was partially offset by an increase in loss on sale of non-strategic businesses and assets of $25 million, primarily due to a pre-tax loss of approximately $28 million related to the pending divestiture of the Friction Materials business within our Transportation Systems segment. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures for further details. Other income decreased by $14 million in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to a $50 million pre-tax gain related to the divestiture of the automotive on-board sensors products business within our Automation and Control Solutions segment in the first quarter of 2011, partially offset by a loss of $29 million resulting from early redemption of debt in 2011 included within Other, net and the reduction of approximately $6 million of acquisition related costs compared to 2011 included within Other, net. Interest and Other Financial Charges ##TABLE_START          2013  2012  2011 Interest and other financial charges  $    $    $   % change compared with prior period  (7)%  (7)%   ##TABLE_END Interest and other financial charges decreased by 7 percent in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower borrowing costs, partially offset by higher average debt balances. Interest and other financial charges decreased by 7 percent in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to lower borrowing costs, partially offset by higher average debt balances. Tax Expense ##TABLE_START          2013  2012  2011 Tax expense  $  1,450   $    $   Effective tax rate   26.8 %    24.4 %    18.3 %  ##TABLE_END The effective tax rate increased by 2.4 percentage points in 2013 compared with 2012. The year over year increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to lower mark-to-market pension expense in the U.S. Other factors causing an increase in the effective tax rate include higher tax expense related to an increase in tax reserves and higher state tax expense. These increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by tax benefits from retroactive law changes in the U.S. The Companys foreign effective tax rate for 2013 was 19.0 percent, an increase of approximately 2.0 percentage points compared to 2012. The year over year increase in the foreign effective tax rate was primarily attributable to higher expense related to retroactive tax law changes in Germany and additional reserves in various jurisdictions, coupled with higher earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to overall foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. The effective tax rate increased by 6.1 percentage points in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings taxed at higher rates (primarily driven by an approximate 6.1 percentage point impact from the decrease in pension mark-to-market expense), a decreased benefit from valuation allowances, a decreased benefit from the settlement of tax audits and the absence of the U.S. RD tax credit, partially offset by a decreased expense related to tax reserves. The foreign effective tax rate was 17.0 percent, a decrease of approximately 4.1 percentage points which primarily consisted of a 10.0 percent impact related to a decrease in tax reserves, partially offset by a 5.2 percent impact from increased valuation allowances on net operating losses primarily due to a decrease in Luxembourg and France earnings available to be offset by net operating loss carry forwards and a 1.4 percent impact from tax expense related to foreign exchange. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to overall foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law on January 2, 2013. Some of these provisions provided retroactive changes to the 2012 tax year which were not taken into account in determining the Companys effective tax rate for 2012. The impact of these retroactive changes was approximately $76 million of lower tax expense and was recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Net Income Attributable to Honeywell ##TABLE_START          2013  2012  2011 Amounts attributable to Honeywell       Income from continuing operations  $  3,924   $  2,926   $  1,858  Income from discontinued operations           209         Net income attributable to Honeywell  $  3,924   $  2,926   $  2,067         Earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution       Income from continuing operations  $  4.92   $  3.69   $  2.35  Income from discontinued operations           0.26         Net income attributable to Honeywell  $  4.92   $  3.69   $  2.61         ##TABLE_END Earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution increased by $1.23 per share in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower pension expense (mainly due to a decrease in the pension mark-to-market adjustment), increased segment profit in each of our business segments and higher other income as discussed above, partially offset by increased tax expense and higher repositioning and other charges. Earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution increased by $1.08 per share in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to lower pension expense (mainly due to a decrease in the pension mark-to-market adjustment), increased segment profit in our Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions and Performance Materials and Technologies segments, lower repositioning and other charges, partially offset by increased tax expense, decreased income from discontinued operations and higher other postretirement expense. For further discussion of segment results, see Review of Business Segments. BUSINESS OVERVIEW This Business Overview provides a summary of Honeywell and its four reportable operating segments (Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions, Performance Materials and Technologies and Transportation Systems), including their respective areas of focus for 2014 and the relevant economic and other factors impacting their results, and a discussion of each segments results for the three years ended December 31, 2013. Each of these segments is comprised of various product and service classes that serve multiple end markets. See Note 24 Segment Financial Data of Notes to the Financial Statements for further information on our reportable segments and our definition of segment profit. Economic and Other Factors In addition to the factors listed below with respect to each of our operating segments, our consolidated operating results are principally impacted by: ##TABLE_START    Change in global economic growth rates and industry conditions and demand in our key end markets;     Overall sales mix, in particular the mix of Aerospace original equipment and aftermarket sales and the mix of Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) products, distribution and services sales;     The extent to which cost savings from productivity actions are able to offset or exceed the impact of material and non-material inflation;     The impact of the pension discount rate and asset returns on pension expense, including mark-to-market adjustments, and funding requirements; and     The impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (in particular the Euro), relative to the U.S. dollar. ##TABLE_END 31 Areas of Focus for 2014 The 2014 areas of focus are supported by the enablers including the Honeywell Operating System, our Velocity Product Development process, and Functional Transformation. These areas of focus are generally applicable to each of our operating segments and include: ##TABLE_START    Driving profitable growth through RD, technological excellence and optimized manufacturing capability to deliver innovative products that customers value;     Expanding margins by maintaining and improving the Companys cost structure through manufacturing and administrative process improvements, repositioning, and other actions, which will drive productivity and enhance the flexibility of the business as it works to proactively respond to changes in end market demand;     Proactively managing raw material costs through formula and long-term supply agreements and hedging activities, where feasible and prudent;     Driving strong cash flow conversion through effective working capital management which will enable the Company to undertake strategic actions to benefit the business including capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, and returning cash to shareholders;     Increasing our sales penetration and expanding our localized footprint in high growth regions, including China, India, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Latin America;     Aligning and prioritizing investments for long-term growth, while considering short-term demand volatility;     Monitoring both suppliers and customers for signs of liquidity constraints, limiting exposure to any resulting inability to meet delivery commitments or pay amounts due, and identifying alternate sources of supply as necessary; and     Controlling Corporate and other non-operating costs, including costs incurred for asbestos and environmental matters, pension and other post-retirement expenses and tax expense. ##TABLE_END 32 Review of Business Segments ##TABLE_START          2013  2012  2011 Net Sales       Aerospace       Product  $  7,043   $  6,999   $  6,494  Service   4,937    5,041    4,981         Total   11,980    12,040    11,475  Automation and Control Solutions       Product   14,193    13,610    13,328  Service   2,363    2,270    2,207         Total   16,556    15,880    15,535  Performance Materials and Technologies       Product   6,223    5,642    5,064  Service   541    542    595         Total   6,764    6,184    5,659  Transportation Systems       Product   3,755    3,561    3,859  Service                    Total   3,755    3,561    3,859  Corporate       Product             Service           1         Total           1           $  39,055   $  37,665   $  36,529         Segment Profit       Aerospace  $  2,372   $  2,279   $  2,023  Automation and Control Solutions   2,437    2,232    2,083  Performance Materials and Technologies   1,271    1,154    1,042  Transportation Systems   498    432    485  Corporate   (227 )    (218 )    (276 )          $  6,351   $  5,879   $  5,357         ##TABLE_END A reconciliation of segment profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before taxes is as follows: ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2013  2012  2011 Segment Profit  $  6,351   $  5,879   $  5,357  Other income (expense)(1)   202    25    33  Interest and other financial charges   (327 )    (351 )    (376 )  Stock compensation expense(2)   (170 )    (170 )    (168 )  Pension ongoing income (expense)(2)   90    (36 )    (105 )  Pension mark-to-market expense(2)   (51 )    (957 )    (1,802 )  Other postretirement income (expense)(2)   (20 )    (72 )    86  Repositioning and other charges(2)   (663 )    (443 )    (743 )         Income from continuing operations before taxes  $  5,412   $  3,875   $  2,282         ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1)   Equity income (loss) of affiliated companies is included in Segment Profit.

Lower sales were primarily driven by decreased light vehicle production in Europe and lower aftermarket sales partially offset by new platform launches, including higher turbo gas penetration in North America. Transportation Systems segment profit decreased by 11 percent in 2012 compared with 2011 due to a 7 percent unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and a 4 percent decrease in operational segment profit. The decrease in operational segment profit is primarily due to decreased volume and unfavorable pricing, substantially offset by productivity (net of the impact of ongoing projects to drive operational improvement in the Friction Materials business), net of inflation. Cost of products and services sold totaled $2.9 billion in 2012, a decrease of $235 million which is primarily a result of foreign exchange, decreased volume and increased productivity. 2014 Areas of Focus Transportation Systems primary areas of focus in 2014 include: ##TABLE_START    Sustaining superior turbocharger technology through successful platform launches;     Maintaining the high quality of current products while executing new product introductions;     Increasing global penetration and share of diesel and gasoline turbocharger OEM demand;     Reducing manufacturing costs through increasing plant productivity and an improving global manufacturing footprint;     Aligning cost structure with current economic outlook, and successful execution of repositioning actions; and     Aligning development efforts and costs with new turbo platform launch schedules. ##TABLE_END 43 Repositioning and Other Charges See Note 3 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to the Financial Statements for a discussion of repositioning and other charges incurred in 2013, 2012, and 2011. Our repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of approximately $150 million in 2014 compared with 2013 principally from planned workforce reductions. Cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute our repositioning actions were $160, $136, and $159 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Such expenditures for severance and other exit costs have been funded through operating cash flows. Cash expenditures for severance and other costs necessary to execute the remaining actions are expected to be approximately $175 million in 2014 and will be funded through operating cash flows. The following tables provide details of the pretax impact of total net repositioning and other charges by segment. ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2013  2012  2011 Aerospace       Net repositioning charge  $    $  (5 )   $          Automation and Control Solutions       Net repositioning charge  $    $    $   Other   3                   $    $    $          Performance Materials and Technologies       Net repositioning charge  $    $    $          Transportation Systems       Net repositioning charge  $    $    $   Asbestos related litigation charges, net of insurance   164    169    146           $    $    $          Corporate       Net repositioning charge  $    $     $   Asbestos related litigation charges, net of insurance   17    (13 )    3  Probable and reasonably estimable environmental liabilities   272    234    240  Other   6                   $    $    $          ##TABLE_END 44 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets, as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables. We continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. Cash Flow Summary Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended 2013, 2012 and 2011, are summarized as follows: ##TABLE_START          2013  2012  2011 Cash provided by (used for):       Operating activities  $  4,335   $  3,517   $  2,833  Investing activities   (1,959 )    (1,428 )    (611 )  Financing activities   (433 )    (1,206 )    (1,114 )  Effect of exchange rate changes on cash   (155 )    53    (60 )         Net increase in cash and cash equivalents  $  1,788   $    $  1,048         ##TABLE_END 2013 compared with 2012 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $818 million during 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to (i) reduced cash contributions to our pension plans of $883 million, (ii) a $447 million increase of net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, (iii) a $135 million favorable impact from working capital (driven by improved accounts payable performance and inventory, partially offset by higher receivables primarily due to sales growth and timing of sales), partially offset by higher cash tax payments of approximately $352 million and a $260 million increase in net payments for repositioning and other charges (most significantly the NARCO Trust establishment payments of $164 million). Cash used for investing activities increased by $531 million during 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $695 million (most significantly Intermec and RAE), partially offset by an increase of approximately $190 million in settlement receipts of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Cash used for financing activities decreased by $773 million during 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $1,462 million, partially offset by an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $651 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of $142 million. 2012 compared with 2011 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $684 million during 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to reduced cash contributions to our pension plans of $706 million and a $342 million increase of net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, partially offset by higher cash tax payments of approximately $340 million. Cash used for investing activities increased by $817 million during 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to (i) a decrease in proceeds from sales of businesses of $1,135 million (most significantly the divestiture of the Consumer Products Group business and the automotive on-board sensor products business within our Automation and Control Solutions segment in 2011), (ii) a net $117 million increase in investments (primarily short-term marketable securities), and (iii) an increase in expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $86 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $535 million. Cash used for financing activities increased by $92 million during 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to a decrease in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $825 million and an increase in dividends paid of $120 million, partially offset by a decrease of $806 million in net repurchases of common stock and a decrease of $33 million in the payment of debt assumed with acquisitions. Liquidity Each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. Considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies, including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, the Company believes that cash balances and operating cash flows are the principal source of liquidity. In addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets, as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables. At December 31, 2013, a substantial portion of the Companys cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. If the amounts held outside of the U.S. were to be repatriated, under current law, they would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability. We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Global economic conditions or a tightening of credit markets could adversely affect our customers or suppliers ability to obtain financing, particularly in our long-cycle businesses and airline, automotive and refining/petrochemical end markets. Customer or supplier bankruptcies, delays in their ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing could adversely affect our cash flow or results of operations. To date we have not experienced material impacts from customer or supplier bankruptcy or liquidity issues. We continue to monitor and take measures to limit our exposure. A source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. There was $1,299 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2013. Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2013, Standard and Poors (SP), Fitch, and Moodys have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 respectively, and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1 respectively. SP, Fitch and Moodys have Honeywells rating outlook as stable. To date, the Company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity. We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions. As a source of liquidity, we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, none of the receivables in the designated pools had been sold to third parties. When we sell receivables, they are over-collateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that over-collateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools. The terms of the trade accounts receivable program permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion, providing us with an additional source of revolving credit. As a result, program receivables remain on the Companys balance sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as Short-term borrowings. In March 2013, the Company repaid $600 million of its 4.25 percent notes. In November 2013, the Company issued $300 million 3.35 percent Senior Notes due 2023 and $700 million Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2015 (collectively, the Notes). The Notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywells existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of Honeywells subordinated debt. The offering resulted in gross proceeds of $1 billion, offset by $7 million in discount and closing costs related to the offering. On December 10, 2013, the Company entered into a $4 billion Amended and Restated Five Year Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks. Commitments under the Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. The Credit Agreement contains a $700 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes and amends and restates the previous $3 billion five year credit agreement dated April 2, 2012 (Prior Agreement). There have been no borrowings under the Credit Agreement or the Prior Agreement. During 2013, the Company repurchased $1,073 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans (see Part II, Item 5 for share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2013). In December 2013, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $5 billion of Honeywell common stock. On June 3, 2013, the Company acquired RAE, a global manufacturer of fixed and portable gas and radiation detection systems, and software. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was $338 million. The acquisition was funded with available cash. See Acquisitions in Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion. On September 17, 2013, the Company acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Intermec, a leading provider of mobile computing, radio frequency identification solutions and bar code, label and receipt printers for use in warehousing, supply chain, field service and manufacturing environments. Intermec was a U.S. public company that operated globally and had reported 2012 revenues of $790 million. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was $607 million. The acquisition was funded with the issuance of commercial paper. See Acquisitions in Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion. In January 2014, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Friction Materials business to Federal Mogul Corporation for approximately $155 million. The transaction, subject to required regulatory approvals and applicable information and consultation requirements, is expected to close in the second half of 2014. See Divestitures in Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion. In 2013, we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans. During 2013, cash contributions of $156 million were made to our non-U.S. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. The NARCO Plan of Reorganization went into effect on April 30, 2013. In 2013, the Company made NARCO Trust establishment payments of $164 million. See Asbestos Matters in Note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of possible funding obligations in 2014 related to the NARCO Trust. In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, dividends, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments. Specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2014 to be as follows: ##TABLE_START    Capital expenditureswe expect to spend approximately $1.2 billion for capital expenditures in 2014 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement.     Share repurchasesunder the Companys share repurchase program, $5 billion is available as of December 31, 2013 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including future option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating, financing and other investing activities.     Dividendswe increased our dividend rate by 10 percent to $.45 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2013 dividend. The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2014.     Asbestos claimswe expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $459 and $76 million, respectively, in 2014. See Asbestos Matters in Note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of possible funding obligations in 2014 related to the NARCO Trust.     Pension contributionsin 2014, we are not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans. We plan to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $150 million ($117 million of marketable securities were contributed in January 2014) to our non-U.S. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. The timing and amount of contributions to both our U.S. and non-U.S. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans.     Repositioning actionswe expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute repositioning actions will approximate $175 million in 2014.     Environmental remediation costswe expect to spend approximately $300 million in 2014 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs. See Environmental Matters in Note 22 to the financial statements for additional information. ##TABLE_END We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2013 and 2012, we realized $3 and $21 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from sales of non-strategic businesses. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines, access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. Contractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments Following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2013: ##TABLE_START              Total(6)  Payments by Period  Thereafter  2014  2015- 2016  2017- 2018 Long-term debt, including capitalized leases(1)  $  7,433   $    $  1,328   $  1,343   $  4,130  Interest payments on long-term debt, including capitalized leases   3,664    315    591    494    2,264  Minimum operating lease payments   1,244    313    440    227    264  Purchase obligations(2)   1,626    796    502    248    80  Estimated environmental liability payments(3)   643    304    230    80    29  Asbestos related liability payments(4)   1,611    461    630    401    119  Asbestos insurance recoveries(5)   (672 )    (77 )    (140 )    (148 )    (307 )               $  15,549   $  2,744   $  3,581   $  2,645   $  6,579             ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1)   Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity. (2)    Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. (3)    The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2013. See Environmental Matters in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information. (4)    These amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2013. We have accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust through 2018. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims from January 2002 until April 2013 when the NARCO Plan of Reorganization became fully effective, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause asbestos liabilities to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. See Asbestos Matters in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information. (5)    These amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos related liabilities as of December 31, 2013. The timing of insurance recoveries are impacted by the terms of insurance settlement agreements, as well as the documentation, review and collection process required to collect on insurance claims. Where probable insurance recoveries are not subject to definitive settlement agreements with specified payment dates, but instead are covered by insurance policies, we have assumed collection will occur beyond 2018. Projecting the timing of insurance recoveries is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the amounts collected to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded or could cause the timing of collections to be earlier or later than that projected. We reevaluate our projections concerning insurance recoveries in light of any changes or developments that would impact recoveries or the timing thereof. See Asbestos Matters in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information. (6)    The table excludes tax effects as well as $729 million of uncertain tax positions. See Note 6 Income Taxes of Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information. ##TABLE_END The table also excludes our pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) obligations. In 2014, we are not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans, however, we plan to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $150 million ($117 million of marketable securities were contributed in January 2014) to our non-U.S. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. The timing and amount of contributions to both our U.S. and non-U.S. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans. Beyond 2014, the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations. Payments due under our OPEB plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans. We expect our OPEB payments to approximate $130 million in 2014 net of the benefit of approximately $11 million from the Medicare prescription subsidy. See Note 23 to the financial statements for further discussion of our pension and OPEB plans. The noncontrolling interest shareholder of UOP Russell LLC (formerly Thomas Russell Co.), one of our subsidiaries, has put rights that may be exercised causing us to purchase their equity interests beginning January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. The same interest is subject to certain call rights by the Company. As the amount paid is based on operating income performance from 2013 to 2015, the actual settlement amount may be different and has therefore been excluded from this table. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Following is a summary of our off-balance sheet arrangements: Guarantees We have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at December 31, 2013: ##TABLE_START      Maximum Potential Future Payments Operating lease residual values  $   Other third parties financing   5  Customer financing   4       $      ##TABLE_END We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination, if any, existing on the date of disposition. Such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly, with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters. It is our policy (see Note 1 to the financial statements) to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. Remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were $272, $234 and $240 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the recorded liabilities for environmental matters was $643 and $654 million, respectively. In addition, in 2013 and 2012 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $88 and $84 million, respectively, relating to compliance with environmental regulations. Remedial response and voluntary cleanup payments were $304, $320 and $270 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are currently estimated to be approximately $300 million in 2014. We expect to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow. Although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. See Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies, including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation. Financial Instruments As a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. A summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to the Financial Statements. We also hold investments in marketable equity securities, which exposes us to market volatility, as discussed in Note 16 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to the Financial Statements. We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade. Our objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency cash flows. We attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties. Our principal currency exposures relate to the U.S. Dollar, Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Mexican Peso, Indian Rupee, Chinese Renminbi, Czech Koruna, Hong Kong Dollar, Korean Won, Singapore Dollar, Swiss Franc, United Arab Emirates Dirham, Swedish Krona, Thai Baht and Romanian Leu. Our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our net debt and pension obligations. As described in Note 14 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements and Note 16 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to the Financial Statements, we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs. Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and expected future cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. The following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one-percentage-point increase in interest rates across all maturities, the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities, and the potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent decrease in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities at December 31, 2013 and 2012. ##TABLE_START            Face or Notional Amount  Carrying Value(1)  Fair Value(1)  Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value(2) December 31, 2013         Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments         Long-term debt (including current maturities)  $  7,433   $  (7,433 )   $  (8,066 )   $  (466 )  Interest rate swap agreements   1,700    55    55    (77 )  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments         Foreign currency exchange contracts(3)   7,298    (7 )    (7 )    296  Commodity Price Sensitive Instruments         Forward commodity contracts(4)   1              December 31, 2012         Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments         Long-term debt (including current maturities)  $  7,020   $  (7,020 )   $  (8,152 )   $  (555 )  Interest rate swap agreements   1,400    146    146    (67 )  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments         Foreign currency exchange contracts(3)   8,506    20    20    361  Commodity Price Sensitive Instruments         Forward commodity contracts(4)   17            (3 )  ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1)   Asset or (liability). (2)    A hypothetical immediate one percentage point decrease in interest rates across all maturities, a potential change in fair value of foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities, and a potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent increase in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities will result in a change in fair value equal to the inverse of the amount disclosed in the table. (3)    Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions. (4)    Changes in the fair value of forward commodity contracts are offset by changes in the cash flows of underlying hedged commodity transactions. ##TABLE_END The above discussion of our procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from our sensitivity analyses are forward-looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. The methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and our Independent Registered Public Accountants. New accounting standards effective in 2013 which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements are described in the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to the Financial Statements. Contingent Liabilities We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. For a discussion of our contingencies related to environmental, asbestos and other matters, including managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities, see Notes 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements. Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries We are a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos (refractory and friction products). We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust through 2018 as described in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements. In light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims from January 2002 through the effective date of the NARCO Trust on April 30, 2013, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. We will continue to update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future Bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year. For additional information see Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. Our insurance is with both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. See Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. We recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment) and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered. Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change as they may each year. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. This accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM charges were $51, $957 and $1,802 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The remaining components of pension income/expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded on a quarterly basis (Pension ongoing (income) expense). For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension income/expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations on future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 23 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to the Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. Information on all our significant actuarial assumptions is included in Note 23 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to the Financial Statements. The key assumptions used in developing our 2013, 2012 and 2011 net periodic pension expense for our U.S. plans included the following: ##TABLE_START          2013  2012  2011 Discount rate   4.06 %    4.89 %    5.25 %  Assets:       Expected rate of return   7.75 %    8 %    8 %  Actual rate of return   23 %    13 %      Actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return   8 %    8 %    6 %  ##TABLE_END The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We will use a 4.89 percent discount rate in 2014, reflecting the increase in the market interest rate environment since December 31, 2012. We plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75 percent for 2014 as this is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long term periods combined with our expectations on future market conditions and the asset mix of the plans investments. In addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment: ##TABLE_START      Change in Assumption  Impact on 2014 Pension Ongoing Expense  Impact on PBO 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate  Decrease $4 million  Increase $529 million 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate  Increase $3 million  Decrease $512 million 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets  Increase $40 million   0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets  Decrease $40 million   ##TABLE_END Pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately $230 million in 2014 compared with pension ongoing income of $90 million in 2013. The increase in pension ongoing income in 2014 compared with 2013 results primarily from an increase in the plans assets at December 31, 2013 compared with December 31, 2012 mainly due to strong asset returns in 2013. Also, if required, an MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2014, and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our U.S. pension plans and did not make a contribution to our U.S. plans during 2013. However, we made voluntary contributions of $792 and $1,650 million to our U.S. pension plans in 2012 and 2011, respectively, primarily to improve the funded status of our plans which had been adversely impacted by relatively low discount rates and asset losses in 2011 and 2008 resulting from the poor performance of the equity markets. In 2014, we are not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans. We plan to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $150 million ($117 million of marketable securities were contributed in January 2014) to our non-U.S. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. The timing and amount of contributions to both our U.S. and non- U.S. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans. Long-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets) To conduct our global business operations and execute our business strategy, we acquire tangible and intangible assets, including property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets. At December 31, 2013, the net carrying amount of these long-lived assets totaled approximately $7.1 billion. The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not these assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations;     Annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line; ##TABLE_END 55 ##TABLE_START     Significant negative industry or economic trends; or     Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. ##TABLE_END Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates, our assumptions as to volume, selling prices and costs, and the discount rate selected. As described in more detail in Note 16 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to the Financial Statements, we have recorded impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $72 million in 2013, principally related to property, plant and equipment and $22 million and 2012, principally related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks acquired in business combinations. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing. Our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances of $13.0 billion and $725 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2013, are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value is reduced to fair value. In testing goodwill, the fair value of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. This impairment test involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions. We completed our annual impairment test as of March 31, 2013 and determined that there was no impairment to our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of that date. However, significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair values in the future. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances, including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions. As of December 31, 2013, we recorded a net deferred tax asset of $1,004 million that is comprised of net deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods. We maintain a valuation allowance of $614 million to offset a portion of this non-U.S. net deferred tax asset. The determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. The projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs. Additionally, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws. Our net deferred tax asset of $1,004 million consists of $19 million related to U.S. operations and $985 million related to non-U.S. operations. The U.S. net deferred tax asset of $19 million consists of federal and state tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards reduced by net taxable temporary differences. The non-U.S. net deferred tax asset of $985 million consists principally of net deductible temporary differences, net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards, (mainly in Canada, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands and the United Kingdom). We maintain a valuation allowance of $614 million against a portion of the non-US net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance maintained against these deferred tax assets reflects our historical experience and lower expectations of taxable income over the applicable carryforward periods. As more fully described in Note 6 to the financial statements, our valuation allowance increased by $16 million in 2013, increased by $7 million in 2012 and decreased by $45 million in 2011. In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income in the period that such determination is made. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known. Sales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts In 2013, we recognized approximately 16 percent of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts in our Automation and Control Solutions, Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies segments. These long- term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting Principles The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is a description of Honeywells significant accounting policies. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. Our consolidation policy requires equity investments that we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investees activities to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. The Consumer Products Group (CPG) automotive aftermarket business had historically been part of the Transportation Systems reportable segment. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, CPG is presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures for further details. Noncontrolling interest is included within the equity section in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Redeemable noncontrolling interest is considered to be temporary equity and is therefore reported outside of permanent equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the greater of the initial carrying amount adjusted for the noncontrolling interests share of net income (loss) or its redemption value. We present net income attributable to Honeywell and the noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Furthermore, we disclose comprehensive income attributable to Honeywell and the noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit and highly liquid, temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out or the average cost method and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for certain qualifying domestic inventories. Investments Investments in affiliates over which we have a significant influence, but not a controlling interest, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Other investments are carried at market value, if readily determinable, or at cost. All equity investments are periodically reviewed to determine if declines in fair value below cost basis are other-than-temporary. Significant and sustained decreases in quoted market prices or a series of historic and projected operating losses by investees are strong indicators of other-than-temporary declines. If the decline in fair value is determined to be other- than-temporary, an impairment loss is recorded and the investment is written down to a new carrying value. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding assets useful life. See Note 11 Property, Plant and EquipmentNet and Note 17 Other Liabilities for additional details. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangible assets determined to have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2013 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. See Note 12 for additional details on goodwill balances. Other Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years. Long-Lived Assets We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with determinable lives) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate events or changes in circumstances based on a number of factors including operating results, business plans and forecasts, general and industry trends and, economic projections and anticipated cash flows. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in earnings. We also evaluate the estimated useful lives of all long-lived assets if circumstances warrant and revise such estimates based on current events. Sales Recognition Product and service sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities in our Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments, are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts in the Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions and Performance Materials and Technologies segments are recorded on a percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident. Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis. Amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses as a result of customers inability to make required payments. We estimate anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on days past due, as measured from the contractual due date, historical collection history and incorporate changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in historical trends for example, customers in bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization. Receivables are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are determined uncollectible. Such determination includes analysis and consideration of the particular conditions of the account, including time intervals since last collection, success of outside collection agencies activity, solvency of customer and any bankruptcy proceedings. Environmental Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and that do not provide future benefits, are expensed as incurred. Liabilities are recorded when environmental remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental losses in excess of our recorded liabilities. Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries Honeywell is a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos (refractory and friction products). We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust through 2018 as described in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies. In light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims from January 2002 through the effective date of the NARCO Trust on April 30, 2013, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. We will continue to update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future Bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year. For additional information see Note 22. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. Aerospace Sales Incentives We provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of our aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and braking system hardware, avionics, and auxiliary power units, for installation on commercial aircraft. These incentives consist of free or deeply discounted products, credits for future purchases of product and upfront cash payments. These costs are recognized in the period incurred as cost of products sold or as a reduction to sales, as appropriate. Generally, for aircraft manufacturers, incentives are recorded when the products are delivered; for airlines, incentives are recorded when the associated aircraft are delivered by the aircraft manufacturer to the airline. Research and Development Research and development costs for company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred. Such costs are principally included in Cost of Products Sold and were $1,804, $1,847 and $1,799 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Plans The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 20 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, include non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs). The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) vesting period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and are based on our historical forfeiture rates. Pension Benefits We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. We recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment), and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered. The remaining components of pension expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded on a quarterly basis (Pension ongoing (income) expense). Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings. Derivative Financial Instruments As a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract. All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. Transfers of Financial Instruments Sales, transfers and securitization of financial instruments are accounted for under authoritative guidance for the transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities. We sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. The terms of the trade accounts receivable program permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion. As a result, these program receivables are not accounted for as a sale and remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as Short-term borrowings. At times we also transfer trade and other receivables that qualify as a sale and are thus are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the time they are sold. The value assigned to any subordinated interests and undivided interests retained in receivables sold is based on the relative fair HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) values of the interests retained and sold. The carrying value of the retained interests approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the collection period for the receivables. Income Taxes Deferred tax liabilities or assets reflect temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting. Such amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax asset if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the amount of a valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. The projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs. Additionally, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the form of accounting standards updates (ASUs) to the FASBs Accounting Standards Codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) In May 2011, the FASB issued amendments to clarify the application of existing fair value measurements and expand existing disclosure requirements. These amendments, effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011 (early adoption was prohibited), resulted in a common definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The implementation of the amended accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2011, the FASB issued amendments to disclosure requirements for presentation of comprehensive income. This guidance, effective retrospectively for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011 (early adoption was permitted), required presentation of total comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the presentation on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for annual and interim financial statements. The implementation of the amended accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In February 2013, the FASB issued amendments to disclosure requirements for presentation of comprehensive income. The standard required presentation (either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements) of the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income based on its source and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification. If a component was not required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety, a cross reference to the related footnote for additional information would be required. The amendments were effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012 (early adoption was permitted). Since these amendments to accounting guidance impacted presentation and disclosure requirements only, their adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2011, the FASB issued amendments to the goodwill impairment guidance which provided an option for companies to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment if certain conditions were met. The amendments were effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 (early adoption was permitted). The implementation of the amended accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In July 2012, the FASB issued amendments to the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment guidance which provided an option for companies to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment if certain conditions were met. The amendments were effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. The implementation of the amended accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In February 2013, the FASB issued amendments to guidance for obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements. The amended guidance requires an entity to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the sum of (1) the amount of the obligation within the scope of this guidance is fixed at the reporting date, as the amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors and (2) any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors. The guidance also requires an entity to disclose the nature and amount of the obligation as well as other information about those obligations. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for obligations within the scope of guidance that exist at the beginning of an entitys fiscal year of adoption. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) December 15, 2013 (early adoption is permitted). The implementation of the amended accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In March 2013, the FASB issued amendments to address the accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. The amendments are effective prospectively for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2013 (early adoption is permitted). The initial adoption has no impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In July 2013, the FASB issued amendments to allow the Federal Funds Effective Swap Rate (which is the Overnight Index Swap rate, or OIS rate, in the U.S.) to be designated as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under the derivatives and hedging guidance. The amendments also allowed for the use of different benchmark rates for similar hedges. The amendments were effective prospectively for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships entered into on or after July 17, 2013. The initial adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operation. In July 2013, the FASB issued amendments to guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The amendments require entities to present an unrecognized tax benefit netted against certain deferred tax assets when specific requirements are met. However, the amendments only affect gross versus net presentation and do not impact the calculation of the unrecognized tax benefit. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013 (early adoption is permitted). The implementation of the amended accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position. Note 2. Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisitions We acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash acquired) of $1,133 million, $438 million, and $973 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For all of our acquisitions the acquired businesses were recorded at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Significant acquisitions made in these years are discussed below. On September 17, 2013, the Company acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Intermec, a leading provider of mobile computing, RFID and bar code, label and receipt printers for use in warehousing, supply chain, field service and manufacturing environments. Intermec was a U.S. public company that operated globally and had reported 2012 revenues of $790 million. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was $607 million and was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. On a preliminary basis, the Company has assigned $257 million to identifiable intangible assets, predominantly customer relationships, existing technology and trademarks. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives which range from 4 to 15 years using straight-line and accelerated amortization methods. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired (approximating $349 million), was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill arises primarily from the avoidance of the time and costs which would be required (and the associated risks that would be encountered) to enhance our product offerings to key target markets and enter into new and profitable segments, and the expected cost synergies that will be realized through the consolidation of the acquired business within our Automation and Control Solutions segment. The goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) On June 3, 2013, the Company acquired RAE, a global manufacturer of fixed and portable gas and radiation detection systems, and software. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was $338 million and was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. On a preliminary basis, the Company has assigned approximately $102 million to identifiable intangible assets, predominantly customer relationships, existing technology and trademarks. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives which range from 3 to 15 years using straight-line and accelerated amortization methods. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired (approximating $264 million), was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill arises primarily from the avoidance of the time and costs which would be required (and the associated risks that would be encountered) to enhance our product offerings to key target markets and enter into new and profitable segments, and the expected cost synergies that will be realized through the consolidation of the acquired business within our Automation and Control Solutions segment. The goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. The results of Intermec and RAE from the acquisition dates through December 31, 2013 are included in our Automation and Control Solutions segment. The results were not material to the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2013, the purchase accounting for Intermec and RAE is subject to final adjustment primarily for the amounts allocated to intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets, for certain pre-acquisition contingencies, and for the valuation of inventory and property, plant and equipment. On October 22, 2012, the Company acquired a 70 percent controlling interest in Thomas Russell Co., a privately-held leading provider of technology and equipment for natural gas processing and treating, for approximately $525 million ($368 million, net of cash acquired). Thomas Russell Co.s results of operations have been consolidated into the Performance Materials and Technologies segment, with the noncontrolling interest portion reflected in net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the calendar year 2016, Honeywell has the right to acquire and the noncontrolling shareholder has the right to sell to Honeywell the remaining 30 percent interest at a price based on a multiple of Thomas Russell Co.s average annual operating income from 2013 to 2015, subject to a predetermined cap and floor. Additionally, Honeywell has the right to acquire the remaining 30 percent interest for a fixed price equivalent to the cap at any time on or before December 31, 2015. See Note 21 Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest. The aggregate value of Thomas Russell Co. was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their consolidated estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The Company has assigned approximately $205 million to identifiable intangible assets. The intangible assets are predominantly backlog, technology, and trademarks. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives, which range from 3 to 10 years, using both straight-line and accelerated amortization methods. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired (approximating $453 million), was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill arises primarily from the avoidance of the time and costs which would be required (and the associated risks that would be encountered) to enhance our product offerings to key target markets and serve as entry into new and profitable businesses within the Performance Materials and Technologies segment. Our interest in the acquired goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The following amounts represent the final determination of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed: ##TABLE_START    Cash  $   Accounts and other receivables   85  Other assets   15  Intangible assets   205  Deferred revenue   (221 )  Other current liabilities   (18 )     Net assets acquired   223  Goodwill   453  Redeemable noncontrolling interest   (151 )     Purchase price  $      ##TABLE_END The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2012 are included in the Performance Materials and Technologies segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. In December 2011, the Company acquired Kings Safetywear Limited (KSW) a leading international provider of branded safety footwear. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was approximately $331 million (including the assumption of debt of $33 million) and was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The Company has assigned approximately $167 million to identifiable intangible assets, predominantly trademarks, technology, and customer relationships. The definite lived intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives, using straight-line and accelerated amortization methods. The value assigned to trademarks of approximately $84 million is classified as indefinite lived intangibles. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired (approximately $157 million), was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill arises primarily from the avoidance of the time and costs which would be required (and the associated risks that would be encountered) to enhance our product offerings to key target markets and serve as entry into new and profitable segments, and the expected cost synergies that will be realized through the consolidation of the acquired business into our Automation and Control Solutions segment. Their cost synergies are expected to be realized principally in the areas of selling, general and administrative expenses, material sourcing and manufacturing. This goodwill is nondeductible for tax purposes. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2011 are included in the Automation and Control Solutions segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. In August 2011, the Company acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of EMS Technologies, Inc. (EMS), a leading provider of connectivity solutions for mobile networking, rugged mobile computers and satellite communications. EMS had reported 2010 revenues of approximately $355 million. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was approximately $513 million and was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The Company has assigned approximately $119 million to identifiable intangible assets, of which approximately $89 million and approximately $30 million were recorded within the Aerospace and Automation and Control segments, respectively. The intangible assets are predominantly customer relationships, existing technology and trademarks. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives, using straight-line and accelerated amortization methods. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired (approximating $314 million), was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill arises primarily from the avoidance of the time and costs which would be required (and the associated risks that would be encountered) to enhance our product offerings to key target markets and serve as entry into new and profitable segments, and the expected cost synergies that will be realized through the consolidation of the acquired business HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) into our Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments. These cost synergies are expected to be realized principally in the areas of selling, general and administrative expenses, material sourcing and manufacturing. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2011 are included in the Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments and were not material to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with all acquisitions in 2013, 2012 and 2011, the amounts recorded for transaction costs and the costs of integrating the acquired businesses into Honeywell were not material. The proforma results for 2013, 2012 and 2011, assuming these acquisitions had been made at the beginning of the comparable prior year, would not be materially different from consolidated reported results. Divestitures In January 2014, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Friction Materials business to Federal Mogul Corporation for approximately $155 million. The transaction, subject to required regulatory approvals and applicable information and consultation requirements, is expected to close in the second half of 2014. The Company recognized a pre-tax and after-tax loss of approximately $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The sale of Friction Materials, which has been part of the Transportation Systems segment, is consistent with the Companys strategic focus on its portfolio of differentiated global technologies. In July 2011, the Company sold its Consumer Products Group business (CPG) to Rank Group Limited. The sale was completed for approximately $955 million in cash proceeds, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $301 million and approximately $178 million, net of tax. The gain was recorded in net income from discontinued operations after taxes in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. The net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest for the discontinued operations is insignificant. The sale of CPG, which had been part of the Transportation Systems segment, is consistent with the Companys strategic focus on its portfolio of differentiated global technologies. The key components of income from discontinued operations related to CPG were as of follows: ##TABLE_START      Year Ended December 31,  2011 Net sales  $   Costs, expenses and other   421  Selling, general and administrative expense   63  Other (income) expense   (2 )     Income before taxes   48     Gain on disposal of discontinued operations   301     Net income from discontinued operations before taxes   349     Tax expense   140     Net income from discontinued operations after taxes  $      ##TABLE_END 73 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives, achieving acquisition-related synergies in our Automation and Control Solutions segment, outsourcing of non-core components in our Aerospace and Transportation Systems segments, the shutdown of a manufacturing facility in our Performance Materials and Technologies segment, and factory transitions in our Automation and Control Solutions segment to more cost-effective locations. The repositioning charges include asset impairments of $23 million primarily related to manufacturing plant and equipment associated with the shutdown of a manufacturing facility in our Performance Materials and Technologies segment. The repositioning charges also includes exit costs of $22 million primarily related to closure obligations associated with the shutdown of manufacturing facilities and costs for early termination of lease contracts. Also, $30 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, in our Automation and Control Solutions and Performance Materials and Technologies segments were returned to income in 2013 due to changes in the scope of previously announced HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) repositioning actions, lower than expected costs in completing the exit of a product line and fewer employee severance actions caused by higher attrition than originally planned associated with prior severance programs. In 2012, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $119 million including severance costs of $91 million related to workforce reductions of 2,204 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to the planned shutdown of a manufacturing facility in our Transportation Systems segment, the exit from a product line in our Performance Materials and Technologies segment, and cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. The repositioning charge also included asset impairments of $12 million principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment associated with the exit of a product line in our Performance Materials and Technologies segment. The repositioning charge also included exit costs of $16 million principally related to closure obligations associated with the planned shutdown of a manufacturing facility in our Transportation Systems segment and exit from a product line in our Performance Materials and Technologies segment. Also, $66 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, in our Automation and Control Solutions, Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies segments were returned to income in 2012 due primarily to fewer employee severance actions caused by higher attrition than originally planned associated with prior severance programs and changes in the scope of previously announced repositioning actions. In 2011, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $380 million including severance costs of $246 million related to workforce reductions of 3,188 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to the planned shutdown of a manufacturing facility in our Transportation Systems segment, cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives, factory transitions in connection with acquisition-related synergies in our Automation and Control Solutions and Aerospace segments, the exit from and/or rationalization of certain product lines and markets in our Performance Materials and Technologies and Automation and Control Solutions segments, the consolidation of repair facilities in our Aerospace segment, and factory consolidations and/or rationalizations and organizational realignments of businesses in our Automation and Control Solutions segment. The repositioning charges included asset impairments of $86 million principally related to the write-off of certain intangible assets in our Automation and Control Solutions segment due to a change in branding strategy and manufacturing plant and equipment associated with the planned shutdown of a manufacturing facility and the exit of a product line and a factory transition as discussed above. The repositioning charges also included exit costs of $48 million principally for costs to terminate contracts related to the exit of a market and product line and a factory transition as discussed above. Exit costs also included closure obligations associated with the planned shutdown of a manufacturing facility and exit of a product line also as discussed above. Also, $26 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, in our Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments, were returned to income in 2011 due principally to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with prior severance programs.

The year over year increase was primarily attributable to lower mark-to-market pension expense in the U.S. Other factors causing an increase in the effective tax rate include higher tax expense related to an increase in tax reserves and higher state tax expense. These increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by tax benefits from retroactive law changes in the U.S. The Companys foreign effective tax rate for 2013 was 19.0 percent, an increase of approximately 2.0 percentage points compared to 2012. The year over year increase in the foreign effective tax rate was primarily attributable to higher expense related to retroactive tax law changes in Germany and additional reserves in various jurisdictions, coupled with higher earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to overall foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The effective tax rate increased by 6.1 percentage points in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings taxed at higher rates (primarily driven by an approximate 6.1 percentage point impact from the decrease in pension mark-to-market expense), a decreased benefit from valuation allowances, a decreased benefit from the settlement of tax audits and the absence of the U.S. RD tax credit, partially offset by a decreased expense related to tax reserves. The foreign effective tax rate was 17.0 percent, a decrease of approximately 4.1 percentage points which primarily consisted of a 10.0 percent impact related to a decrease in tax reserves, partially offset by a 5.2 percent impact from increased valuation allowances on net operating losses primarily due to a decrease in Luxembourg and French earnings available to be offset by net operating loss carry forwards and a 1.4 percent impact from tax expense related to foreign exchange. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to overall foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. Deferred tax assets (liabilities) Deferred income taxes represent the future tax effects of transactions which are reported in different periods for tax and financial reporting purposes. The tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which give rise to future income tax benefits and payables are as follows: ##TABLE_START      Deferred tax assets:  December 31,  2013  2012 Pension  $    $  1,362  Postretirement benefits other than pensions   499    657  Asbestos and environmental   437    535  Employee compensation and benefits   382    402  Other accruals and reserves   702    504  Net operating and capital losses   838    820  Tax credit carryforwards   266    333       Gross deferred tax assets   3,156    4,613  Valuation allowance   (614 )    (598 )       Total deferred tax assets  $  2,542   $  4,015       Deferred tax liabilities:     Property, plant and equipment  $  (654 )   $  (668 )  Intangibles   (1,126 )    (1,106 )  Other asset basis differences   (350 )    (327 )  Other   (22 )    (39 )       Total deferred tax liabilities   (2,152 )    (2,140 )       Net deferred taxes  $    $  1,875       ##TABLE_END The net deferred tax assets are included as components of Current and Non-Current Deferred Income Taxes and Accrued Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. There were approximately $45 million of U.S. federal tax net operating losses available for carryforward at December 31, 2013 with various expiration dates though 2032. All of these carryforwards were generated by subsidiaries prior to their acquisition. The use of pre-acquisition net operating loss carryforwards are subject to limitations imposed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We do not anticipate that these limitations will affect the utilization of these carryforwards prior to their expiration. The Company has state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $2.7 billion at December 31, 2013 with various expiration dates through 2034. We also have foreign net operating and capital losses of $3.0 billion which are available to reduce future income tax payments in several countries, subject to varying expiration rules. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) There were approximately $62 million of U.S. federal tax credits available for carryforward at December 31, 2013 with various expiration dates through 2032. All of these carryforwards were generated by subsidiaries prior to their acquisition. The use of pre-acquisition tax credit carryforwards are subject to limitations imposed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We do not anticipate that these limitations will affect the utilization of these carryforwards prior to their expiration. We also have state tax credit carryforwards of $46 million at December 31, 2013, including carryforwards of $40 million with various expiration dates through 2028 and tax credits of $6 million which are not subject to expiration. There were approximately $173 million of tax credits available for carryforward in foreign jurisdictions, primarily in Canada, at December 31, 2013 with various expiration dates through 2032. The valuation allowance against deferred tax assets increased by $16 million in 2013 and increased by $7 million and decreased by $45 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The 2013 increase in the valuation allowance was primarily due to decreased earnings in France and Luxembourg. This is partially offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance in Germany and the United Kingdom. The 2012 increase in the valuation allowance was primarily due to decreased earnings in France and Luxembourg. This is partially offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance related to purchase accounting for various acquisitions and audit resolutions for various countries. The 2011 decrease in the valuation allowance was primarily due to decreased foreign net operating losses related to the Netherlands and Germany, partially offset by the increase in the valuation allowance of France, Luxembourg and Canada. Federal income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of the majority of our international subsidiaries as it is our intention to reinvest these earnings into the respective subsidiaries. At December 31, 2013 Honeywell has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $13.5 billion of such earnings of our non-U.S. operations. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability. We had $729 million, $722 million and $815 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 respectively. If recognized, $729 million would be recorded as a component of income tax expense as of December 31, 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company increased its unrecognized tax benefits by $7 million due to adjustments related to our ongoing assessment of the likelihood and amount of potential outcomes of current and future examinations, partially offset by the expiration of various statute of limitations and resolutions of audits with tax authorities. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company decreased its unrecognized tax benefits by $93 million due to the expiration of various statute of limitations and resolutions of audits with tax authorities, partially offset by adjustments related to our ongoing assessment of the likelihood and amount of potential outcomes of current and future examinations. The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START          2013  2012  2011 Change in unrecognized tax benefits:       Balance at beginning of year  $    $    $   Gross increases related to current period tax positions   41    25    46  Gross increases related to prior periods tax positions   118    44    327  Gross decreases related to prior periods tax positions   (21 )    (62 )    (56 )  Decrease related to resolutions of audits with tax authorities   (92 )    (40 )    (237 )  Expiration of the statute of limitations for the assessment of taxes   (30 )    (64 )    (12 )  Foreign currency translation   (9 )    4    (10 )         Balance at end of year  $    $    $          ##TABLE_END 80 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Generally, our uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. The following table summarizes these open tax years by major jurisdiction as of December 31, 2013: ##TABLE_START      Jurisdiction  Open Tax Year  Examination in progress  Examination not yet initiated United States(1)  2001    2012  2007    2013 United Kingdom  N/A  2011    2013 Canada(1)  2007    2012  2013 Germany(1)  2004    2011  2010    2013 France  2000    2003, 2008    2013  2004    2007 Netherlands  2009  2010    2013 Australia  N/A  2009    2013 China  2003    2012  2013 India  2000    2011  2012    2013 Italy  2008    2012  2013 ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1)   Includes federal as well as state, provincial or similar local jurisdictions, as applicable. ##TABLE_END Based on the outcome of these examinations, or as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns will materially change from those recorded as liabilities for uncertain tax positions in our financial statements. In addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods. Based on the number of tax years currently under audit by the relevant U.S federal, state and foreign tax authorities, the Company anticipates that several of these audits may be finalized in the foreseeable future. However, based on the status of these examinations, the protocol of finalizing audits by the relevant taxing authorities, and the possibility that the Company might challenge certain audit findings (which could include formal legal proceedings), at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits for examinations in progress were $431 million, $443 million and $482 million, as of December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. The decrease from 2012 to 2013 is primarily due to the expiration of various statute of limitations and resolutions of audits with tax authorities. The decrease from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to the expiration of various statute of limitations and resolutions of audits with tax authorities. Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of Tax Expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and totaled $17 million, $37 million and $63 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties were $301 million, $284 million and $247 million, as of December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

The Notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywells existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of Honeywells subordinated debt. The offering resulted in gross proceeds of $1 billion, offset by $7 million in discount and closing costs related to the offering. On December 10, 2013, the Company entered into a $4 billion Amended and Restated Five Year Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks. Commitments under the Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. The Credit Agreement contains a $700 million sublimit for the issuance of HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes and amends and restates the previous $3 billion five year credit agreement dated April 2, 2012 (Prior Agreement). There have been no borrowings under the Credit Agreement or the Prior Agreement. The Credit Agreement does not restrict our ability to pay dividends and contains no financial covenants. The failure to comply with customary conditions or the occurrence of customary events of default contained in the Credit Agreement would prevent any further borrowings and would generally require the repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Such events of default include: (a) non-payment of Credit Agreement debt, interest or fees; (b) non-compliance with the terms of the Credit Agreement covenants; (c) cross-default with other debt in certain circumstances; (d) bankruptcy or insolvency; and (e) defaults upon obligations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Additionally, each of the banks has the right to terminate its commitment to lend additional funds or issue letters of credit under the Credit Agreement if any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 30 percent or more of our voting stock, or, during any 12-month period, individuals who were directors of Honeywell at the beginning of the period cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors. The Credit Agreement has substantially the same material terms and conditions as the Prior Agreement with an improvement in pricing and an extension of maturity. Loans under the Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no later than December 10, 2018, unless such date is extended pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. Revolving credit borrowings under the Credit Agreement would bear interest, at Honeywells option, (A) (1) at a rate equal to the highest of (a) the floating base rate publicly announced by Citibank, N.A., (b) 0.5 percent above the Federal funds rate or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00 percent, plus (2) a margin based on Honeywells credit default swap mid-rate spread and subject to a floor and a cap as set forth in the Credit Agreement (the Applicable Margin) minus 1.00 percent, provided such margin shall not be less than zero; or (B) at a rate equal to LIBOR plus the Applicable Margin; or (C) by a competitive bidding procedure. We have agreed to pay a commitment fee for the aggregate unused commitment for the Credit Agreement, which is subject to change, based upon a grid determined by our long term debt ratings. The Credit Agreement is not subject to termination based upon a decrease in our debt ratings or a material adverse change as defined by the Credit Agreement. As a source of liquidity, we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, none of the receivables in the designated pools had been sold to third parties. When we sell receivables, they are over-collateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that over-collateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools. The terms of the trade accounts receivable program permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion, providing us with an additional source of revolving credit. As a result, program receivables remain on the Companys balance sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as Short-term borrowings. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Note 15. Lease Commitments Future minimum lease payments under operating leases having initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows: ##TABLE_START      At December 31, 2013  $   2015   252  2016   188  2017   135  2018   92  Thereafter   264      $  1,244     ##TABLE_END We have entered into agreements to lease land, equipment and buildings. Principally all our operating leases have initial terms of up to 25 years, and some contain renewal options subject to customary conditions. At any time during the terms of some of our leases, we may at our option purchase the leased assets for amounts that approximate fair value. We do not expect that any of our commitments under the lease agreements will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Rent expense was $404, $390 and $386 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Note 16. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Credit and Market Risk Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers. Foreign Currency Risk Management We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. Our objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency denominated cash flows. We attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts with third parties. We hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in Other (Income) Expense. We partially hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which predominantly occur in the next twelve months and are denominated in non-functional currencies, with HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) currency forward contracts. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the currency forward contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. Open foreign currency exchange forward contracts mature predominantly in the next twelve months. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had contracts with notional amounts of $7,298 million and $8,506 million, respectively, to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S. Dollar, Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Mexican Peso, Indian Rupee, Chinese Renminbi, Czech Koruna, Hong Kong Dollar, Korean Won, Singapore Dollar, Swiss Franc, United Arab Emirates Dirham, Swedish Krona, Thai Baht and Romanian Leu. Commodity Price Risk Management Our exposure to market risk for commodity prices can result in changes in our cost of production. We primarily mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk through the use of long-term, fixed-price contracts with our suppliers and formula price agreements with suppliers and customers. We also enter into forward commodity contracts with third parties designated as hedges of anticipated purchases of several commodities. Forward commodity contracts are marked-to-market, with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had contracts with notional amounts of $1 million and $17 million, respectively, related to forward commodity agreements, principally base metals and natural gas. Interest Rate Risk Management We use a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively changed $1,700 million and $1,400 million, respectively, of fixed rate debt at rates of 3.96 and 4.09, respectively, to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Our interest rate swaps mature at various dates through 2023. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The FASBs accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The FASBs guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy: ##TABLE_START    Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or   Unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or   Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability Level 3  Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability ##TABLE_END The Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2013 and 2012: HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) ##TABLE_START        December 31,  2013  2012 Assets:     Foreign currency exchange contracts  $    $   Available for sale investments   826    518  Interest rate swap agreements   63    146  Forward commodity contracts       1  Liabilities:     Foreign currency exchange contracts  $    $   Interest rate swap agreements   8      Forward commodity contracts       1  ##TABLE_END The foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate swap agreements, and forward commodity contracts are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2. The Company holds investments in marketable equity securities that are designated as available for sale and are valued using quoted market prices. As such, these investments are classified within level 1. The Company also holds investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale and are valued using market transactions in over-the-counter markets. As such, these investments are classified within level 2. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were not carried at fair value: ##TABLE_START            December 31, 2013  December 31, 2012  Carrying Value  Fair Value  Carrying Value  Fair Value Assets         Long-term receivables  $    $    $    $   Liabilities         Long-term debt and related current maturities  $  7,433   $  8,066   $  7,020   $  8,152  ##TABLE_END The Company determined the fair value of the long term receivables by discounting based upon the terms of the receivable and counterparty details including credit quality. As such, the fair value of these receivables is considered level 2. The Company determined the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities utilizing transactions in the listed markets for identical or similar liabilities. As such, the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities is considered level 2 as well. At December 31, 2013, the Company had nonfinancial assets, principally property, plant and equipment, with a net book value of $244 million, which were accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets were tested for impairment and based on the fair value of these assets the Company recognized losses of $72 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily in connection with our repositioning actions (see Note 3 Repositioning and Other Charges) and the pending divestiture of the Friction Materials business within our Transportation Systems segment. At December 31, 2012, the Company had nonfinancial assets, principally property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, with a net book value of $22 million, which were accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets were tested for impairment and based on the fair value of these assets the Company recognized losses of $22 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily in connection with our repositioning actions (see Note 3 Repositioning and Other Charges). The Company has determined that the fair value measurements of these nonfinancial assets are level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company utilizes the market, income or cost approaches or a combination HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) of these valuation techniques for its non-recurring level 3 fair value measures. Inputs to such measures include observable market data obtained from independent sources such as broker quotes and recent market transactions for similar assets. It is the Companys policy to maximize the use of observable inputs in the measurement of fair value or non-recurring level 3 measurements. To the extent observable inputs are not available the Company utilizes unobservable inputs based upon the assumptions market participants would use in valuing the asset. Examples of utilized unobservable inputs are future cash flows, long term growth rates and applicable discount rates. We enter into transactions that are subject to arrangements designed to provide for netting of offsetting obligations in the event of the insolvency or default of a counterparty. However, we have not elected to offset multiple contracts with a single counterparty, therefore the fair value of the derivative instruments in a loss position is not offset against the fair value of derivative instruments in a gain position. The derivatives utilized for risk management purposes as detailed above are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and impacted the Statement of Operations as follows: Fair value of derivatives classified as assets consist of the following: ##TABLE_START        Designated as a Hedge  Balance Sheet Classification  December 31,  2013  2012 Foreign currency exchange contracts  Accounts, notes, and other receivables  $    $   Interest rate swap agreements  Other assets   63    146  Forward commodity contracts  Accounts, notes, and other receivables       1  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START        Not Designated as a Hedge  Balance Sheet Classification  December 31,  2013  2012 Foreign currency exchange contracts  Accounts, notes, and other receivables  $    $   ##TABLE_END Fair value of derivatives classified as liabilities consist of the following: ##TABLE_START        Designated as a Hedge  Balance Sheet Classification  December 31,  2013  2012 Foreign currency exchange contracts  Accrued liabilities  $    $   Interest rate swap agreements  Accrued liabilities   8      Forward commodity contracts  Accrued liabilities       1  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START        Not Designated as a Hedge  Balance Sheet Classification  December 31,  2013  2012 Foreign currency exchange contracts  Accrued liabilities  $    $   ##TABLE_END Gains (losses) recognized in other comprehensive income (effective portions) consist of the following: ##TABLE_START      Designated Cash Flow Hedge  Years Ended December 31,  2013  2012 Foreign currency exchange contracts  $  (37 )   $   Forward commodity contracts   (1 )    (8 )  ##TABLE_END Gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI to income consist of the following: ##TABLE_START        Designated Cash Flow Hedge  Income Statement Location  Years Ended December 31,  2013  2012 Foreign currency exchange contracts  Product sales  $  (7 )   $  (7 )    Cost of products sold   (4 )    23   Sales  general administrative   (11 )    (12 )  Forward commodity contracts  Cost of products sold  $  (1 )   $  (17 )  ##TABLE_END 91 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Ineffective portions of commodity derivative instruments designated in cash flow hedge relationships were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and are classified within cost of products sold. Foreign currency exchange contracts in cash flow hedge relationships qualify as critical matched terms hedge relationships and as a result have no ineffectiveness. Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or (losses) on the derivative recognized in Interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt being hedged. Losses on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $91 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. Gains on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $12 million in the year ended 2012. Gains and losses are fully offset by losses and gains on the underlying debt being hedged. We also economically hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts. These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. We recognized $162 million and $20 million of income, in Other (Income) Expense for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. See Note 4 Other (Income) Expense for further details of the net impact of these economic foreign currency hedges. Note 17.

Capital Stock We are authorized to issue up to 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $1. Common shareowners are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by the Board, are entitled to one vote per share, and are entitled, in the event of liquidation, to share ratably in all the assets of Honeywell which are available for distribution to the common shareowners. Common shareowners do not have preemptive or conversion rights. Shares of common stock issued and outstanding or held in the treasury are not liable to further calls or assessments. There are no restrictions on us relative to dividends or the repurchase or redemption of common stock. In December 2013 the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $5 billion of Honeywell common stock, $5 billion remained available as of December 31, 2013 for additional share repurchases. We purchased a total of approximately 13.5 million and 5 million shares of our common stock in 2013 and 2012, for $1,073 and $317 million, respectively. We are authorized to issue up to 40,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value, and can determine the number of shares of each series, and the rights, preferences and limitations of each series. At December 31, 2013, there was no preferred stock outstanding. Note 19.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans We have stock-based compensation plans available to grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted units and restricted stock to key employees. Under the terms of the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (the Plan) there were 25,913,501 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants at December 31, 2013. Additionally, under the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (the Directors Plan) there were 145,367 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grant at December 31, 2013. Stock Options The exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under our stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of our stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employees requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The expected term represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Compensation cost on a pre-tax basis related to stock options recognized in operating results (included in selling, general and administrative expenses) in 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $70, $65 and $59 million, respectively.

The total intrinsic value of options (which is the amount by which the stock price exceeded the exercise price of the options on the date of exercise) exercised during 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $367, $202 and $164 million, respectively. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $432, $305 and $290 million, respectively, with an associated tax benefit realized of $129, $74 and $54 million, respectively. In 2013, 2012 and 2011 we classified $99, $56 and $42 million, respectively, of this benefit as a financing cash inflow in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and the balance was classified as cash from operations. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) At December 31, 2013 there was $120 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock option awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.28 years. The total fair value of options vested during 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $67, $63 and $52 million, respectively. Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock unit (RSU) awards entitle the holder to receive one share of common stock for each unit when the units vest. RSUs are issued to certain key employees at fair market value at the date of grant as compensation. RSUs typically become fully vested over periods ranging from three to seven years and are payable in Honeywell common stock upon vesting. The following table summarizes information about RSU activity for the three years ended December 31, 2013: ##TABLE_START        Number of Restricted Stock Units  Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Non-vested at December 31, 2010   9,973,953   $  39.89  Granted   1,887,733    55.11  Vested   (1,509,528 )    49.48  Forfeited   (605,725 )    40.11       Non-vested at December 31, 2011   9,746,433    41.35  Granted   2,156,753    59.52  Vested   (3,380,251 )    31.84  Forfeited   (427,196 )    45.78       Non-vested at December 31, 2012   8,095,739    49.91  Granted   1,904,504    75.73  Vested   (2,995,553 )    42.17  Forfeited   (312,470 )    56.58       Non-vested at December 31, 2013   6,692,220   $  60.04       ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2013, there was approximately $191 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs granted under our stock plans which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.42 years. Compensation expense related to RSUs was $100, $105 and $109 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. The associated future income tax benefit recognized in 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $35, $37, and $36 million, respectively. Non-Employee Directors Plan Under the Directors Plan each new non-employee director receives a one-time grant of 3,000 restricted stock units that will vest on the fifth anniversary of continuous Board service. In 2011, each non-employee director received an annual grant to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock at the fair market value on the date of grant. In 2012, the annual equity grant changed from a fixed number of shares to a target value of $75,000 and consists of 50 percent options and 50 percent RSUs. Options become exercisable over a four-year period and expire after ten years. RSUs generally vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant. Note 21. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest As discussed in Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures, on October 22, 2012, the Company acquired a 70 percent controlling interest in Thomas Russell Co. During the calendar year 2016, Honeywell has the right to acquire and the noncontrolling shareholder has the right to sell to Honeywell the remaining 30 percent interest at a price based on a multiple of Thomas Russell Co.s average annual operating income from 2013 to 2015, subject to a predetermined cap and floor. Additionally, Honeywell has the HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) right to acquire the remaining 30 percent interest for a fixed price equivalent to the cap at any time on or before December 31, 2015. Noncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as the arrangement described above, that are not solely within the Companys control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. Redeemable noncontrolling interest is considered temporary equity and is therefore reported outside of permanent equity on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at the greater of the initial carrying amount adjusted for the noncontrolling interests share of net income (loss) or its redemption value. The Company accretes changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of acquisition to the date that the redemption feature becomes puttable. The Company will reflect redemption value adjustments in the earnings per share calculation if redemption value is in excess of the fair value of the noncontrolling interest. As of December 31, 2012, the redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest approximated the carrying value. The rollforward of redeemable noncontrolling interest from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013 is as follows: ##TABLE_START      2013 Balance at beginning of year  $   Net income   29  Distributions   (26 )  Redemption value adjustment   11  Other   3     Balance at end of year  $      ##TABLE_END Note 22. Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded liabilities for environmental costs: ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2013  2012  2011 Beginning of year  $    $    $   Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and       reasonably estimable   272    234    240  Environmental liability payments   (304 )    (320 )    (270 )  Other   21    17             End of year  $    $    $          ##TABLE_END Environmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts: ##TABLE_START        December 31, 2013  December 31, 2012 Accrued liabilities  $    $   Other liabilities   339    350        $    $        ##TABLE_END Although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that these environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. New Jersey Chrome Sites The excavation and offsite disposal of approximately one million tons of chromium residue present at a predecessor Honeywell site located in Jersey City, New Jersey, known as Study Area 7, was completed in January 2010. We are also implementing related groundwater remedial actions, and are conducting related river sediment work. In addition, remedial investigations and related activities are underway at other sites in Hudson County, New Jersey that allegedly have chromium contamination, and for which Honeywell has accepted responsibility in whole or in part. Provisions have been made in our financial statements for the estimated cost of investigations and implementation of these remedies consistent with the accounting policy described above. We do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or operating cash flows. Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, NY We are implementing a combined dredging/capping remedy of Onondaga Lake pursuant to a consent decree approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York in January 2007. We have accrued for our estimated cost of remediating Onondaga Lake based on currently available information and analysis performed by our engineering consultants. Honeywell is also conducting remedial investigations and activities at other sites in Syracuse. We have recorded reserves for these investigations and activities where appropriate, consistent with the accounting policy described above. Honeywell has entered into a cooperative agreement with potential natural resource trustees to assess alleged natural resource damages relating to this site. It is not possible to predict the outcome or duration of this assessment, or the amounts of, or responsibility for, any damages. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Asbestos Matters Like many other industrial companies, Honeywell is a defendant in personal injury actions related to asbestos. We did not mine or produce asbestos, nor did we make or sell insulation products or other construction materials that have been identified as the primary cause of asbestos related disease in the vast majority of claimants. Honeywells predecessors owned North American Refractories Company (NARCO) from 1979 to 1986. NARCO produced refractory products (bricks and cement used in high temperature applications). We sold the NARCO business in 1986 and agreed to indemnify NARCO with respect to personal injury claims for products that had been discontinued prior to the sale (as defined in the sale agreement). NARCO retained all liability for all other claims. NARCO and/or Honeywell are defendants in asbestos personal injury cases asserting claims based upon alleged exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products. Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing refractory products in an occupational setting. These claims, and the filing of subsequent claims, were stayed continuously since January 4, 2002, the date on which NARCO sought bankruptcy protection (see discussion below). Honeywells Bendix friction materials (Bendix) business manufactured automotive brake parts that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form. Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of individuals who performed brake replacements.

In connection with the filing of NARCOs petition in 2002, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania (the Bankruptcy Court) issued an injunction staying the prosecution of NARCO-related asbestos claims against the Company, which stayed in place throughout NARCOs Chapter 11 case. In November 2007, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed NARCOs Third Amended Plan of Reorganization (NARCO Plan of Reorganization) and it became fully effective on April 30, 2013. In connection with implementation of the NARCO Plan of Reorganization, a federally authorized 524(g) trust (NARCO Trust) was established for the evaluation and resolution of all existing and future NARCO asbestos claims. Both Honeywell and NARCO are protected by a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based on exposure to NARCO products to be made against the NARCO Trust. The NARCO Trust will review submitted claims and determine award amounts in accordance with established Trust Distribution Procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court which set forth all criteria claimants must meet to qualify for compensation including, among other things, exposure and medical criteria that determine the award amount. In addition, Honeywell will continue to provide input to the detailed controls design of the NARCO Trust, and has on-going audit rights to review and monitor claims processors adherence to the established requirements of the Trust Distribution Procedures and as a means of detecting and deterring irregularities in claims. In connection with NARCOs bankruptcy filing, Honeywell agreed to certain obligations which were triggered upon the effective date of the NARCO Plan of Reorganization. As agreed, during the second quarter of 2013, we provided NARCO with $17 million in financing and simultaneously forgave such indebtedness. We also paid $40 million to NARCOs former parent company and $16 million to certain HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) asbestos claimants whose claims were fully resolved during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings. Honeywell is obligated to fund NARCO asbestos claims submitted to the trust which qualify for payment under the Trust Distribution Procedures, subject to annual caps of $140 million in the years 2014 through 2018 and $145 million for each year thereafter, provided, however, that the first $100 million of claims processed through the NARCO Trust (the Initial Claims Amount) will not count against the first year annual cap and any unused portion of the Initial Claims Amount will roll over to subsequent years until fully utilized. Honeywell will also be responsible for the following funding obligations which are not subject to the annual cap described above: a) previously approved payments due to claimants pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings which provide that a portion of these settlements is to be paid by the NARCO Trust, which amounts are estimated at $130 million and are expected to be paid during the first year of trust operations ($91 million of which was paid during 2013) and, b) payments due to claimants pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and Trust Distribution Procedures criteria, which amounts are estimated at $150 million and are expected to be paid during the first two years of trust operations. Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for the amounts discussed above, unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection and for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust through 2018. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims which remained in place throughout NARCOs Chapter 11 case, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. In the absence of actual trust experience on which to base the estimate, Honeywell projected the probable value, including trust claim handling costs, of asbestos related future liabilities based on Company specific and general asbestos claims filing rates, expected rates of disease and anticipated claim values. Specifically, the valuation methodology included an analysis of the population likely to have been exposed to asbestos containing products, epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases, NARCO asbestos claims filing history, general asbestos claims filing rates in the tort system and in certain operating asbestos trusts, and the claims experience in those forums, the pending inventory of NARCO asbestos claims, disease criteria and payment values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures and an estimated approval rate of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust. This methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims has been commonly accepted by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts and resulted in a range of estimated liability of $743 to $961 million. We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. Our insurance receivable corresponding to the estimated liability for pending and future NARCO asbestos claims reflects coverage which reimburses Honeywell for portions of NARCO-related indemnity and defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. We conduct analyses to determine the amount of insurance that we estimate is probable of recovery in relation to payment of current and estimated future claims. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. We made judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the NARCO-related asbestos liabilities or assets to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. There is no assurance that insurance recoveries will be timely or whether there will be any NARCO-related asbestos claims beyond 2018. Given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future events, we review our estimates periodically, and update them based on our experience and other relevant factors. Similarly, we will reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability or other developments that may impact insurance recoveries.

Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of pending (claims actually filed as of the financial statement date) and future Bendix-related asbestos claims. We have valued Bendix pending and future claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix pending and future claims during the fourth quarter each year. The liability for future claims represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury claims expected to be asserted against Bendix over the next five years. Such estimated cost of future Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. The methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims is similar to that used to estimate the future NARCO-related asbestos claims liability. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Our insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of pending and future Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the solvency of our insurers, judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with our insurers. On a cumulative historical basis, Honeywell has recorded insurance receivables equal to approximately 36 percent of the value of the underlying asbestos claims recorded. However, because there are gaps in our coverage due to insurance company insolvencies, certain uninsured periods, and insurance settlements, this rate is expected to decline for any future Bendix-related asbestos liabilities that may be recorded. Future recoverability rates may also be impacted by numerous other factors, such as future insurance settlements, insolvencies and judicial determinations relevant to our coverage program, which are difficult to predict. Assuming continued defense and indemnity spending at current levels, we estimate that the cumulative recoverability rate could decline over the next five years to approximately 30 percent. Honeywell believes it has sufficient insurance coverage and reserves to cover all pending Bendix-related asbestos claims and Bendix-related asbestos claims estimated to be filed within the next five years. Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of either pending or future Bendix-related asbestos claims, we do not believe that such claims would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position in light of our insurance coverage and our prior experience in resolving such claims. If the rate and types of claims filed, the average resolution value of such claims and the period of time over which claim settlements are paid (collectively, the Variable Claims Factors) do not substantially change, Honeywell would not expect future Bendix-related asbestos claims to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in any fiscal year. No assurances can be given, however, that the Variable Claims Factors will not change. Other Matters We are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Included in these other matters are the following: Honeywell v. United Auto Workers (UAW) et. al In July 2011, Honeywell filed an action in federal court (District of New Jersey) against the UAW and all former employees who retired under a series of Master Collective Bargaining Agreements (MCBAs) between Honeywell and the UAW. The Company is seeking a declaratory judgment that certain express limitations on its obligation to contribute toward the healthcare coverage of such retirees (the CAPS) set forth in the MCBAs may be implemented, effective January 1, 2012. In September 2011, the UAW and certain retiree defendants filed a motion to dismiss the New Jersey action and filed suit in the Eastern District of Michigan alleging that the MCBAs do not provide for CAPS on the Companys liability for healthcare coverage. The UAW and retiree plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for class certification and a motion for partial summary judgment in the Michigan action, seeking a ruling that retirees who retired HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) prior to the initial inclusion of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA are not covered by the CAPS as a matter of law. In December 2011, the New Jersey action was dismissed on forum grounds. Honeywell appealed the New Jersey courts dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The Third Circuit denied the appeal. Honeywell has now answered the UAWs complaint in Michigan and has asserted counterclaims for fraudulent inducement, negligent misrepresentation and breach of implied warranty. The parties stipulated to the certification of a class of all potentially affected retirees, surviving spouses, and eligible dependents. The UAW filed a motion to dismiss these counterclaims. The court dismissed Honeywells fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation claims, but let stand the claim for breach of implied warranty. Honeywell is confident that the CAPS will be upheld and that its liability for healthcare coverage premiums with respect to the putative class will be limited as negotiated and expressly set forth in the applicable MCBAs. In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywells other postretirement benefits for pre-2003 retirees would increase by approximately $180 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS. Joint Strike Fighter Investigation In 2013 the Company received subpoenas from the Department of Justice requesting information relating primarily to parts manufactured in the United Kingdom and China used in the F-35 fighter jet. The Company is cooperating fully with the investigation. While we believe that Honeywell has complied with all relevant U.S. laws and regulations regarding the manufacture of these sensors, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the investigation or what action, if any, may result from it. Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations (including the specific matters referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above). Considering our past experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. Warranties and Guarantees We have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at December 31, 2013: ##TABLE_START      Maximum Potential Future Payments Operating lease residual values  $   Other third parties financing   5  Customer financing   4       $      ##TABLE_END We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination, if any, existing on the date of disposition. Such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In the normal course of business we issue product warranties and product performance guarantees. We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale. Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties and guarantees are made as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Note 23. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. Pension benefits for substantially all U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. U.S. defined benefit pension plans comprise 75 percent of our projected benefit obligation. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywells U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Non-U.S. employees, who are not U.S. citizens, are covered by various retirement benefit arrangements, some of which are considered to be defined benefit pension plans for accounting purposes. Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans comprise 25 percent of our projected benefit obligation. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage to eligible retirees. Our retiree medical plans mainly cover U.S. employees who retire with pension eligibility for prescription drug, hospital, professional and other medical services. Most of the U.S. retiree medical plans require deductibles and copayments, and virtually all are integrated with Medicare. Retiree contributions are generally required based on coverage type, plan and Medicare eligibility. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell after January 1, 2000 are not eligible to participate in our retiree medical and life insurance plans. Less than 5 percent of Honeywells U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company; and this subsidy is limited to a fixed-dollar amount. In addition, more than seventy-five percent of Honeywells current retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. In 2013, Honeywell amended its U.S. retiree medical plans to no longer offer certain retirees Company group coverage. This plan amendment reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $166 million which will be recognized as part of net periodic postretirement benefit cost over the expected future lifetime of the remaining participants in the plans. Also in 2013, in connection with a new collective bargaining agreement reached with a union group, Honeywell amended its plans eliminating the Company subsidy for these union employees. The plan amendment resulted in a curtailment gain of $42 million which was included as part of net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The curtailment gain represents the recognition in net periodic postretirement benefit cost of prior service credits attributable to the future years of service of the union group for which future accrual of benefits has been eliminated. In 2011, in connection with new collective bargaining agreements reached with several of its union groups, Honeywell amended its U.S. retiree medical plans eliminating the subsidy for those union employees which resulted in curtailment gains totaling $167 million. The curtailment gains represented the recognition in net periodic postretirement benefit cost of prior service credits attributable to the future years of service of the union groups for which future accrual of benefits was eliminated. The following tables summarize the balance sheet impact, including the benefit obligations, assets and funded status associated with our significant pension and other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2013 and 2012.

To determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments. We use the average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations. Our expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 7.75 percent is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) and broad asset mix considerations. We review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. For non-U.S. benefit plans, none of which was individually material, assumptions reflect economic assumptions applicable to each country. Pension Benefits Included in the aggregate data in the tables above are the amounts applicable to our pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets. Amounts related to such plans were as follows: ##TABLE_START            December 31,  U.S. Plans  Non-U.S. Plans  2013  2012  2013  2012 Projected benefit obligation  $    $  17,117   $    $  4,670  Accumulated benefit obligation  $    $  16,288   $    $  4,426  Fair value of plan assets  $    $  14,345   $    $  3,837  ##TABLE_END Accumulated benefit obligation for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $15.7 and $16.3 billion and for our Non-U.S. defined benefit plans were $5.3 and $5.0 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our asset investment strategy for our U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve our long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. Our actual invested positions in various securities change over time based on short and longer- term investment opportunities. To achieve our objectives, we have established long-term target allocations as follows: 60-70 percent equity securities, 10-20 percent fixed income securities and cash, 5-15 percent real estate investments, and 10-20 percent other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located both inside and outside the United States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies. We review our assets on a regular basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations. Our non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing standard funding and investment guidance. Local regulations, local funding rules, and local financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. While our non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country, the long-term investment objectives are generally the same as those for the U.S. pension assets. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Sufficient cash or cash equivalents are held by our pension plans to cover the notional value of the futures contracts. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, our U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $1,938 and $1,241 million, respectively. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, our Non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $61 and $55 million, respectively. In both our U.S. and Non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is primarily related to outstanding equity futures contracts. Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgages, asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in commingled funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals. Our general funding policy for qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans. No contribution was made to the U.S. plans in 2013. However, in 2012 and 2011, we made voluntary contributions of $792 and $1,650 million, respectively, to the U.S. plans primarily to improve the funded status. These contributions do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets. In 2013, cash contributions of $156 million were made to our non-U.S. plans to satisfy regularly funding requirements. In 2014, we expect to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $150 million ($117 million of marketable securities were contributed in January 2014) to our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. We are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2014. Benefit payments, including amounts to be paid from Company assets, and reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows: ##TABLE_START        U.S. Plans  Non-U.S. Plans  $  1,068   $   2015   1,111    208  2016   1,106    213  2017   1,105    219  2018   1,118    226  2019-2023   5,675    1,228  ##TABLE_END Other Postretirement Benefits ##TABLE_START        December 31,  2013  2012 Assumed health care cost trend rate:     Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year   7.00 %    7.00 %  Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to   5.00 %    5.00 %  Year that the rate reaches the rate it is assumed to remain at   2019    2019  ##TABLE_END The assumed health care cost trend rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and the financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey February 14, 2014 ", "9A": " Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Honeywell management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K to ensure information required to be disclosed in the reports that Honeywell files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and our Controller, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There have been no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Honeywells internal control over financial reporting that have occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2013. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Honeywell management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Honeywells internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Honeywells internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Honeywells assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Honeywells management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Honeywells assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of Honeywells internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (1992). Based on this assessment, management determined that Honeywell maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013. The effectiveness of Honeywells internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8.

EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS As of December 31, 2013 information about our equity compensation plans is as follows: ##TABLE_START        Plan category  Number of Shares to be Issued Upon Exercise of Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights  Weighted- Average Exercise Price of Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights  Number of Securities Remaining Available for Future Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans (Excluding Securities Reflected in Column (a))   (a)  (b)  (c) Equity compensation plans approved by security holders   39,151,116 (1)   $  53.27 (2)    28,192,463 (3)  Equity compensation plans not approved by security holders   554,475 (4)    N/A (5)    N/A (6)         Total   39,705,591    53.27    28,192,463         ##TABLE_END 123 ##TABLE_START (1)   Equity compensation plans approved by shareowners awards under which are included in column (a) of the table are the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan), the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan), and the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan) (30,284,081 shares of Common Stock to be issued for options with a weighted average term of 6.43 years; 18,000 shares to be issued for stock appreciation rights (SARs); 6,665,554 RSUs subject to continued employment; and 1,805,848 deferred RSUs of earned and vested awards where delivery of shares has been deferred); and the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (the 2006 Non-Employee Director Plan) and the 1994 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (the 1994 Non-Employee Director Plan) (354,356 shares of Common Stock to be issued for options; and 23,277 RSUs subject to continued services). RSUs included in column (a) of the table represent the full number of RSUs awarded and outstanding whereas the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon vesting will be lower than what is reflected on the table due to the net share settlement process used by the Company (whereas the value of shares required to meet employee statutory minimum tax withholding requirements are not issued).     1,092,801 growth plan units were issued for the performance cycle commencing on January 1, 2010 and ending December 31, 2011 pursuant to the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. The second and final payment related to these growth plan units was paid in March 2013, subject to active employment on the payment date. 1,535,800 growth plan units were issued for the performance cycle commencing January 1, 2012 and ending December 31, 2013 pursuant to the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan. 50% of the payment related to these growth plan units, if any, will be paid in March 2014 and the remaining 50% will be paid in March 2015, subject to active employment on the payment dates.     The ultimate value of any growth plan award may be paid in cash or shares of Common Stock and, thus, growth plan units are not included in the table above. The ultimate value of growth plan units depends upon the achievement of pre-established performance goals during the two-year performance cycle.     Because the number of future shares that may be distributed to employees participating in the Honeywell Global Stock Plan is unknown, no shares attributable to that plan are included in column (a) of the table above. (2)    Column (b) relates to stock options and does not include any exercise price for RSUs or growth plan units granted to employees or non-employee directors under equity compensation plans. RSUs do not have an exercise price because their value is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals or continued employment or service and they are settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. Growth plan units are denominated in cash and the ultimate value of the award is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals. (3)    The number of shares that may be issued under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2013 is 25,913,501 which includes the following additional shares under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (or any Prior Plan as defined in the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan) that may again be available for issuance: shares that are settled for cash, expire, are canceled, or under any Prior Plan, are tendered in satisfaction of an option exercise price or tax withholding obligations, are reacquired with cash tendered in satisfaction of an option exercise price or with monies attributable to any tax deduction enjoyed by Honeywell to the exercise of an option, or are under any outstanding awards assumed under any equity compensation plan of an entity acquired by Honeywell. No securities are available for future issuance under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 1994 Non-Employee Director Plan.     The number of shares that may be issued under the Honeywell Global Stock Plan as of December 31, 2012 is 2,133,595. This plan is an umbrella plan for three plans maintained solely for eligible employees of participating non-U.S. countries.     A sub-plan of the Honeywell Global Stock Plan, the UK Sharebuilder Plan, allows an eligible UK employee to contribute a specified percentage of their taxable earnings that is then invested in shares. The Company matches those shares and dividends paid are used to purchase additional ##TABLE_END 124 ##TABLE_START    shares of Common Stock. The match share percentage for 2013 was 62.50%. Matched shares are subject to a three-year vesting schedule. Shares taken out of the plan before five years lose their tax-favored status. For the year ending December 31, 2013, 77,716 shares were credited to participants accounts under the UK Sharebuilder Plan.     The remaining two sub-plans of the Honeywell Global Stock Plan, the Honeywell International Technologies Employees Share Ownership Plan (Ireland) and the Honeywell Measurex (Ireland) Limited Group Employee Profit Sharing Scheme, allow eligible employees in Ireland to contribute specified percentages of base pay, bonus or performance pay that are then invested in Common Stock. Shares must be held in trust for at least two years and lose their tax-favored status if they are taken out of the plan before three years. For the year ending December 31, 2013, 14,453 shares of Common Stock were credited to participants accounts under these two plans. A fourth sub-plan, the Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan, was terminated as of February 1, 2013, and all shares remaining in the plan on that date were transferred to direct registration accounts maintained by the Corporations stock transfer agent.     The remaining 145,367 shares included in column (c) are shares remaining for future grants under the 2006 Non-Employee Director Plan. (4)    Equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners that are included in the table are the Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees of Honeywell International Inc. and its Subsidiaries, the AlliedSignal Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Employees of AlliedSignal Inc. and its Subsidiaries and the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc.     The Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees of Honeywell International Inc. and its Subsidiaries is an unfunded, non-tax qualified plan that provides benefits equal to the employee deferrals and company matching allocations that would have been provided under Honeywells U.S. tax-qualified savings plan if the Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and contributions did not apply. The Company matching contribution is credited to participants accounts in the form of notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of Common Stock when payments are made to participants under the plan. The number of shares to be issued under this plan based on the value of the notional shares as of December 31, 2013 is 530,403.     The AlliedSignal Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Employees of AlliedSignal Inc. and its Subsidiaries was a cash incentive compensation plan maintained by AlliedSignal Inc. This plan has expired. Employees were permitted to defer receipt of a cash bonus payable under the plan and invest the deferred bonus in notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of Common Stock when payments are made to participants under the plan. No further deferrals can be made under this plan. The number of shares of Common Stock that remain to be issued under this expired plan as of December 31, 2013 is 24,072.     The Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. provides for mandatory and elective deferral of certain payments to non-employee directors. Mandatory deferrals are invested in notional shares of Common Stock. Directors may also invest any elective deferrals in notional shares of Common Stock. Because the notional shares are distributed in the form of cash when payments are made to directors under the plan, they are not included in the table above. (5)    Column (b) does not include any exercise price for notional shares allocated to employees under Honeywells equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners because all of these shares are notionally allocated as a matching contribution under the non-tax qualified savings plans or as a notional investment of deferred bonuses or fees under the cash incentive compensation and directors plans as described in note 4 and are only settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. (6)    No securities are available for future issuance under the AlliedSignal Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Employees of AlliedSignal Inc. and its Subsidiaries and the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. The cash incentive compensation ##TABLE_END 125 ##TABLE_START    plan has expired. All notional investments in shares of Common Stock are converted to cash when payments are made under the directors plan. The amount of securities available for future issuance under the Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees of Honeywell International Inc. and its Subsidiaries is not determinable because the number of securities that may be issued under this plan depends upon the amount deferred to the plan by participants in future years.     The table does not contain information for employee benefit plans of Honeywell that are intended to meet the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and a small number of foreign employee benefit plans that are similar to such Section 401(a) plans. ##TABLE_END ", "13": " Item 13.

Major Businesses We globally manage our business operations through three businesses that are reported as operating segments: Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions (ACS), and Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT). Financial information related to our operating segments is included in Note 21 Segment Financial Data of Notes to Financial Statements. The major products/services, customers/uses and key competitors of each of our operating segments are as follows: Aerospace Our Aerospace segment is a leading global supplier of aircraft engines, integrated avionics, systems and service solutions, and related products and services for aircraft manufacturers, airlines, aircraft operators, military services, and defense and space contractors.

Automation and Control Solutions Our ACS segment is a leading global provider of environmental and combustion controls, sensing controls, security and life safety products and services, scanning and mobility devices and building solutions and services for homes, commercial buildings and industrial facilities. Our ACS products and services include controls and displays for heating, cooling, indoor air quality, ventilation, humidification, combustion, lighting and home automation; advanced software applications for home/building control and optimization; sensors, switches, control systems and instruments for measuring pressure, air flow, temperature and electrical current; security, fire and gas detection; personal protection equipment; access control; video surveillance; remote patient monitoring systems; products for automatic identification and data collection; installation, maintenance and upgrades of systems that keep buildings safe, comfortable and productive; and automation and control solutions for industrial plants, including field instruments and advanced software and automation systems that integrate, control and monitor complex processes in many types of industrial settings as well as equipment that controls, measures and analyzes natural gas production and transportation. Performance Materials and Technologies Our PMT segment is a global leader in developing and manufacturing advanced materials, process technologies and automation solutions. PMTs UOP business provides process technology, products, including catalysts and adsorbents, equipment and consulting services to efficiently produce gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals and renewable fuels for the petroleum refining, gas processing, petrochemical, and other industries.

PMTs Advanced Materials businesses manufacture a wide variety of high-performance products, including fluorocarbons, hydrofluoroolefins, caprolactam, resins, ammonium sulfate fertilizer, phenol, specialty films, waxes, additives, advanced fibers, customized research chemicals and intermediates, and electronic materials and chemicals. Competition We are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas. Some of our key competitors are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Aerospace: Borg-Warner (automotive), Garmin, General Electric, Rockwell Collins, Thales and United Technologies    ACS: 3M, Johnson Controls, Schneider, Siemens and Zebra-Motorola    PMT: Albemarle, BASF, Dow, Dupont, Emerson and Sinopec ##TABLE_END Our businesses compete on a variety of factors, such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. A number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies, some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers. Aerospace Sales Our sales to aerospace customers were 39%, 40%, and 41% of our total sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers were 6%, 7%, and 7% of our total sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 11%, 11%, and 12% of our total sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. U.S. Government Sales Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by our Aerospace segment), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $3,693 million, $3,856 million and $4,109 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a prime contractor and subcontractor, of $2,792 million, $3,066 million and $3,273 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. U.S. defense spending decreased in 2014 compared to 2013. We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2015 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (Original Equipment Manufacturers production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs), increases in direct foreign defense and space market sales, as well as our diversified commercial businesses. Backlog Our total backlog at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $18,313 million and $17,512 million, respectively. We anticipate that approximately $12,605 million of the 2014 backlog will be filled in 2015. We believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option. International Operations We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development globally. U.S. exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 14% of our total sales in each of 2014, 2013 and 2012. Foreign manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 41% of our total sales in each of 2014, 2013 and 2012. ##TABLE_START               Manufactured Products and Systems and Performance of Services  Year Ended December 31, 2014  Aerospace  Automation and Control Solutions  Performance Materials and Technologies   (% of Total Sales) U.S. Exports   20 %    3 %    21 %  Non-U.S.   32 %    67 %    16 %  ##TABLE_END Raw Materials The principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available. Although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply, we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2014. We are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials, except related to R240 (a key component in foam blowing agents), a raw material used in our PMT segment. The costs of certain key raw materials, including cumene, fluorspar, R240, natural gas, perchloroethylene, sulfur and ethylene in our PMT business and nickel, steel, titanium and other metals in our Aerospace business, are expected to continue to fluctuate. We will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2015. Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product, to be of material importance in relation to our total business. Research and Development The Companys principal research and development activities are in the U.S., India, Europe and China. Research and development (RD) expense totaled $1,892 million, $1,804 million and $1,847 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in RD expense of 5% in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased expenditures for new product development in our ACS and PMT segments. Customer-sponsored (principally the U.S. Government) RD activities amounted to an additional $1,034 million, $969 million and $835 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Environment We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is also possible that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys National Priority List. Although there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, to date we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole. We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Companys business or markets that it serves, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. Employees We have approximately 127,000 employees at December 31, 2014, of whom approximately 50,000 are located in the United States. Executive Officers of the Registrant The executive officers of Honeywell, listed as follows, are elected annually by the Board of Directors.

Risk Factors Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements We describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Results of Operations and in other parts of this report (including this Item 1A). Such discussions contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Risk Factors Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Macroeconomic and Industry Risks Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations. ##TABLE_START    Aerospace Operating results of our business units within Aerospace are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions and capacity constraints. The operating results of our Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial aftermarket business units may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and global flying hours, which impacts business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results in our Defense and Space Systems business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs. Operating results in our Transportation Systems business unit may be affected by the level of production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products and delays in launch schedules for new automobile and truck platforms.    Automation and Control Solutions Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation, industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion, and inventory levels in distribution channels.    Performance Materials and Technologies Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply volatility, and our ability to maximize our facilities production capacity and minimize downtime. Pricing of certain chemical products are driven by ##TABLE_END 6 ##TABLE_START    raw materials that are correlated to the price of oil, hence revenue could be significantly impacted by volatility in the price of oil. ##TABLE_END An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations. Our international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Companys sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes), violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate these risks), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. Operating outside of the United States also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss. A change in the level of U.S. Government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact Aerospaces defense and space sales and results of operations. A shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate and/or reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations. Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. Operational Risks Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities. The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in PMT (cumene, fluorspar, R240, natural gas, perchloroethylene, sulfur and ethylene) and Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations. Many major components, product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses. Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to employee attrition. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in highly competitive markets with acceptable margins. Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring new products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, (ii) the failure to integrate acquired businesses into Honeywell on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies, (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions, and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities or, with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification. As a supplier of military and other equipment to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unusual risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future. We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third party service providers. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. Legal and Regulatory Risks Our U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety, performance and product certification regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of our Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial Aftermarket business units may be impacted by, among other things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be effected by changes in government procurement regulations, while emissions, fuel economy and energy efficiency standards for motor vehicles can impact the Transportation Systems business unit. Within ACS, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. PMTs results of operations can be affected by environmental, safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, import and export matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Honeywell International Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (Honeywell or the Company) for the three years ended December 31, 2014. All references to Notes relate to Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In April 2014, the Company announced the realignment of our Honeywell Process Solutions business from Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) into Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT). The Company has reported its financial performance based on the inclusion of Honeywell Process Solutions in Performance Materials and Technologies for all periods presented. In July 2014, following the closing of the sale of its Friction Materials business, the Company announced the realignment of its Transportation Systems business segment with its Aerospace business segment. Under the realigned segment reporting structure, the Company has three business segments: Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions and Performance Materials and Technologies. The Company has reported its financial performance based on the inclusion of Transportation Systems in Aerospace for all periods presented. These realignments have no impact on the Companys historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY For Honeywell, 2014 represented a year of strong performance despite a continued slow growth global environment. Honeywells 2014 revenues were $40.3 billion representing a 3% improvement compared to 2013 revenues of $39.1 billion. Our segment profit improved by 5%, more than one and one-half times revenue growth, evidencing the Companys continued focus on operational excellence. We achieved strong segment profit expansion while reinvesting in our businesses through seed planting and continued focus on effective repositioning. The Companys operational excellence and ability to expand profit faster than sales growth is due in part to a consistent, methodical application of several key internal business processes, the Honeywell Enablers, which drive improvements in organizational efficiency and service quality, bringing world-class products and services to markets faster and more cost effectively for our customers. We continued to execute on our key strategies for growth including penetration of high growth regions and investments in high return capital expenditures and new products and technologies, while maintaining our cost disciplines and leveraging the Honeywell Enablers. The Company continues to invest for future growth as measured by a number of important metrics: ##TABLE_START    RD spending at 4.7% of revenues was targeted at such high growth areas as natural gas processing, low global warming refrigerants and blowing agents, avionics equipment and technology, connected voice and wireless control devices and technologies, software and mobile app development and data science to deliver value.    Capital expenditures of $1,094 million (in addition to $947 million in 2013) principally related to the construction and expansion of Aerospace and PMT manufacturing facilities, as well as continued investment in our ACS facilities.    The Company recognized $184 million of charges relating to repositioning actions to support sustainable productivity in years to come.    The Company continued to monitor its portfolio of businesses to ensure they fit our long-term strategic plan. In 2014, the Company sold its Friction Materials business for approximately $155 million. In addition, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire Datamax-ONeil, ##TABLE_END 15 ##TABLE_START    a global manufacturer of fixed and mobile printers, for $185 million (the transaction is expected to close in early 2015).    Expansion of Honeywells presence and sales in high growth regions and countries such as China, India, Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Sales to customers outside the United States increased by 5% in 2014 and now account for approximately 55% of total revenues.    Operating cash flow grew by 16% in 2014 to $5,024 million. This operating cash flow performance enabled us to invest $1,094 million in capital expenditures, repay $600 million in long-term debt, provide a 15% increase in the Companys cash dividend rate (vs. 2013) and repurchase 10.0 million shares of common stock. ##TABLE_END CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales ##TABLE_START          2014  2013  2012 Net sales  $  40,306   $  39,055   $  37,665  % change compared with prior period  3%  4%   ##TABLE_END The change in net sales is attributable to the following: ##TABLE_START        2014 Versus 2013  2013 Versus 2012 Volume   3%    1%  Price       1%  Acquisitions/Divestitures   1%    2%  Other   (1)%             3%    4%       ##TABLE_END A discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this MDA.

Earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution increased in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower pension expense, increased segment profit in each of our business segments and higher other income, partially offset by increased tax expense and higher repositioning and other charges. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Our consolidated operating results are principally impacted by: ##TABLE_START    Change in global economic growth rates and industry conditions and demand in our key end markets;    Overall sales mix, in particular the mix of Aerospace original equipment and aftermarket sales and the mix of ACS products, distribution and services sales;    The impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (in particular the Euro), relative to the U.S. dollar;    The extent to which cost savings from productivity actions are able to offset or exceed the impact of material and non-material inflation; and    The impact of the pension discount rate and asset returns on pension expense, including mark-to-market adjustments, and funding requirements. ##TABLE_END Our 2015 areas of focus are supported by the Honeywell Enablers, including the Honeywell Operating System (HOS Gold), Velocity Product Development, Functional Transformation and the Honeywell User Experience. These areas of focus are generally applicable to each of our operating segments and include: ##TABLE_START    Driving profitable growth through RD, technological excellence and optimized manufacturing capability to deliver innovative products that customers value;    Expanding margins by maintaining and improving the Companys cost structure through manufacturing and administrative process improvements, repositioning, and other actions, which will drive productivity and enhance the flexibility of the business as it works to proactively respond to changes in end market demand;    Proactively managing raw material costs through formula and long-term supply agreements and hedging activities, where feasible and prudent;    Driving strong cash flow conversion through effective working capital management which will enable the Company to undertake strategic actions to benefit the business including capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, and returning cash to shareholders;    Driving organic growth through expansion of our localized footprint in high growth regions, including China, India, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Latin America;    Driving inorganic growth through the identification of appropriate acquisition targets and deployment of our disciplined, rigorous MA and integration processes;    Aligning and prioritizing capital expenditures for long-term growth, while considering short-term demand volatility;    Monitoring both suppliers and customers for signs of liquidity constraints, limiting exposure to any resulting inability to meet delivery commitments or pay amounts due, and identifying alternate sources of supply as necessary; and    Controlling Corporate and other non-operating costs, including costs incurred for asbestos and environmental matters, pension and other post-retirement expenses and tax expense. ##TABLE_END 18 Review of Business Segments ##TABLE_START              Years Ended December 31,  % Change  2014 Versus 2013  2013 Versus 2012  2014  2013  2012 Aerospace Sales           Commercial Original Equipment  $  2,607   $  2,651   $  2,568    (2 )%    3 %  Commercial Aftermarket   4,578    4,459    4,364    3 %    2 %  Defense and Space   4,754    4,870    5,108    (2 )%    (5 )%  Transportation Systems   3,659    3,755    3,561    (3 )%    5 %         Total Aerospace Sales   15,598    15,735    15,601      Automation and Control Solutions Sales           Energy Safety  Security   9,738    8,756    8,123    11 %    8 %  Building Solutions  Distribution   4,749    4,709    4,664    1 %    1 %         Total Automation and Control Solutions Sales   14,487    13,465    12,787      Performance Materials and Technologies Sales           UOP   3,195    2,962    2,253    8 %    31 %  Process Solutions   3,122    3,091    3,093    1 %      Advanced Materials   3,904    3,802    3,931    3 %    (3 )%         Total Performance Materials and Technologies Sales   10,221    9,855    9,277             Net Sales  $  40,306   $  39,055   $  37,665             ##TABLE_END Aerospace ##TABLE_START                         2014  2013  Change  2012  Change Net sales  $  15,598   $  15,735    (1 )%   $  15,601    1 %  Cost of products and services sold   11,699    11,889      11,863    Selling, general and administrative expenses   712    705      763    Other   272    271      264             Segment profit  $  2,915   $  2,870    2 %   $  2,711    6 %           ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START                   Factors Contributing to Year-Over-Year Change  2014 vs. 2013  2013 vs. 2012  Sales  Segment Profit  Sales  Segment Profit Organic growth/ Operational segment profit   2 %    8 %    1 %    6 %  Acquisitions, divestitures and other, net   (3 )%    (6 )%                   Total % Change    (1 )%     2 %     1 %     6 %           ##TABLE_END 2014 compared with 2013 Aerospace sales decreased primarily due to the Friction Materials divestiture and an increase in incentive payments due to air transport and regional and business and general aviation original equipment (OE) manufacturers (OEM Incentive Payments), partially offset by an increase in organic sales, as discussed below. ##TABLE_START    Commercial Original Equipment sales decreased by 2% (increased by 3% organic) primarily due to an increase in OEM Incentive Payments to air transport and regional OE manufacturers, partially offset by higher air transport volumes, consistent with the OE Manufacturers higher production rates, and business and general aviation engine shipments.    Commercial Aftermarket sales increased by 3% driven primarily by higher sales of spare parts to air transport and regional customers, partially offset by a decline in retrofits, modifications and ##TABLE_END 19 ##TABLE_START    upgrades and lower repair and overhaul activities for our business and general aviation customers.    Defense and Space sales decreased by 2% primarily due to lower U.S. government services revenue and the absence of a prior year royalty gain, partially offset by growth in international programs.    Transportation Systems sales decreased by 3% (increased by 5% organic) primarily due to the Friction Materials divestiture, partially offset by continued growth from new platform launches, higher global turbo gas penetration and increased commercial vehicle demand in Europe. ##TABLE_END Aerospace segment profit increased by 2% due to an 8% increase in operational segment profit, partially offset by a 6% unfavorable impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other (predominantly higher OEM Incentive Payments and the absence of a prior year royalty gain), as discussed above. The increase in operational segment profit is driven primarily by favorable price and productivity, net of inflation. Cost of products and services sold totaled $11.7 billion in 2014, a decrease of $190 million, primarily due to the factors discussed above (excluding price). 2013 compared with 2012 Aerospace sales increased primarily due to favorable pricing, increased volumes in our Commercial Original Equipment business and increased licensing revenue (primarily due to a royalty gain in the fourth quarter), offset by decreased volumes in our Defense and Space and Commercial Aftermarket businesses and an increase in incentive payments due to business and general aviation and air transport and regional OE manufacturers to partially offset their pre-production costs associated with new aircraft platforms. ##TABLE_START    Commercial Original Equipment sales increased by 3% driven primarily by higher air transport volumes, consistent with the OE Manufacturers higher production rates, and strong demand in the business jet mid to large cabin segment, partially offset by an increase in OEM Incentive Payments to business and general aviation customers.    Commercial Aftermarket sales increased by 2% driven primarily by higher retrofits, modifications and upgrades activities and higher repair and overhaul activities for air transport and regional customers, partially offset by fewer repair and overhaul activities for business and general aviation customers.    Defense and Space sales decreased by 5% primarily due to U.S. government program ramp downs and lower defense budget, partially offset by a royalty gain in the fourth quarter.    Transportation Systems sales increased by 5% primarily due to an increase in organic sales driven by continued strong growth from new platform launches and higher global turbo gas penetration. ##TABLE_END Aerospace segment profit increased by 6% primarily due to an increase in operational segment profit driven by commercial sales growth, as discussed above, including favorable pricing and productivity, net of inflation, partially offset by lower defense and space sales, as discussed above. Cost of products and services sold totaled $11.9 billion in 2013, an increase of approximately $26 million, primarily due to the factors discussed above (excluding price).

Catalyst sales decreased in the fourth quarter due to the timing of shipments as well as stronger volume growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to 2014 which was partially offset by increased licensing revenues.    Sales in our Process Solutions business increased by 1% (4% organic) driven primarily by volume growth in advanced solutions software and services and field products partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange, predominately in the fourth quarter. Project and service orders and backlog increased in 2014.    Advanced Materials sales increased by 3% primarily driven by increased volume in Fluorine Products and Resins and Chemicals, partially offset by unfavorable pricing most significantly in Fluorine Products and Resins and Chemicals. We anticipate unfavorable pricing to continue in 2015 primarily in Resins and Chemicals where sales fluctuate with the market price of certain raw materials, which are correlated to the price of oil. ##TABLE_END PMT segment profit increased by 5% due to a 6% increase in operational segment profit partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily due to higher sales volumes, as discussed above, and productivity, net of inflation partially offset by unfavorable Advanced Materials pricing, continued investment for growth and unfavorable foreign exchange. Cost of products and services sold totaled $7.2 billion in 2014, an increase of $247 million which is primarily due to higher volume and continued investment for growth partially offset by productivity, net of inflation and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. 2013 compared with 2012 PMT sales increased by 6% due to 5% growth from acquisitions and 1% increase in organic growth. ##TABLE_START    UOP sales increased by 31% (9% organic) primarily driven by (i) the favorable impact of acquisitions, (ii) higher volume of petrochemical catalysts, (iii) increased revenue from gas processing and (iv) increased equipment revenue in the first half of 2013, partially offset by decreased service revenues related to scheduled project completions and lower licensing revenues. ##TABLE_END 22 ##TABLE_START    Sales in our Process Solutions business were flat (increased 1% organic) principally due to decreased volume reflecting the completion of several large projects as expected offset by service and software solutions volume growth. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Advanced Materials sales decreased by 3% primarily driven by (i) lower Flourine Products volume (due to the unfavorable impact of unseasonably cool weather on refrigerant volume and planned plant outages in the first half of 2013) and price, (ii) soft end market conditions in Electronic Materials and (iii) lower production volume in Resins and Chemicals. ##TABLE_END PMT segment profit increased by 11% due to a 6% increase in operational segment profit and a 5% increase from acquisitions. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily due to higher UOP sales volume and positive impact of productivity, net of inflation and investment for growth. Cost of products and services sold totaled $6.9 billion in 2013, an increase of $347 million which is primarily due to acquisitions and inflation, partially offset by productivity. Repositioning Charges See Note 3 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2014, 2013 and 2012. These repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of $100 million to $125 million in 2015 compared with 2014 principally from planned workforce reductions. Cash spending related to our repositioning actions was $161 million, $160 million and $136 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and was funded through operating cash flows. In 2015, we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately $150 million and to be funded through operating cash flows. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. We continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. Cash Flow Summary Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows: ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2014  2013  2012 Cash provided by (used for):       Operating activities  $  5,024   $  4,335   $  3,517  Investing activities   (1,876 )    (1,959 )    (1,428 )  Financing activities   (2,272 )    (433 )    (1,206 )  Effect of exchange rate changes on cash   (339 )    (155 )    53         Net increase in cash and cash equivalents  $    $  1,788   $          ##TABLE_END 2014 compared with 2013 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $689 million primarily due to (i) a $508 million increase of net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, (ii) reduced net payments for repositioning and other charges of $233 million (primarily due to the collection of a $130 million asbestos receivable due from one of our insurance carriers and lower asbestos related payments of $98 million), (iii) reduced cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $131 million and (iv) lower cash tax payments of approximately $129 million, partially offset by a $93 million unfavorable impact from working capital (primarily driven by higher inventory to support sales growth). Cash used for investing activities decreased by $83 million primarily due to a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $1,129 million (most significantly Intermec and RAE Systems, Inc. in 2013) and an increase in proceeds from the sales of businesses of $157 million (most significantly Friction Materials), partially offset by (i) a net $688 million increase in investments (primarily short-term marketable securities), (ii) an increase of approximately $371 million in settlement payments of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and (iii) a $147 million increase in expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Cash used for financing activities increased by $1,839 million primarily due to a decrease in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $1,589 million, an increase in cash dividends paid of $157 million and lower net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $33 million. 2013 compared with 2012 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $818 million primarily due to (i) reduced cash contributions to our pension plans of $883 million, (ii) a $447 million increase of net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, (iii) a $135 million favorable impact from working capital (driven by improved accounts payable performance and inventory, partially offset by higher receivables primarily due to sales growth and timing of sales), partially offset by higher cash tax payments of approximately $352 million and a $260 million increase in net payments for repositioning and other charges (most significantly the NARCO Trust establishment payments of $164 million). Cash used for investing activities increased by $531 million primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $695 million (most significantly Intermec and RAE Systems Inc.), partially offset by an increase of approximately $190 million in settlement receipts of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Cash used for financing activities decreased by $773 million primarily due to an increase in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $1,462 million, partially offset by an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $651 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of $142 million. Liquidity Each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. Considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies, including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity. In addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. At December 31, 2014, a substantial portion of the Companys cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. If the amounts held outside of the U.S. were to be repatriated, under current law, they would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest the vast majority of these funds outside of the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability. We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. A source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings and commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 0.60% and 0.79%, respectively. Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2014, Standard and Poors (SP), Fitch, and Moodys have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 respectively, and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1 respectively. SP, Fitch and Moodys have Honeywells rating outlook as stable. To date, the Company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity. We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions. On December 10, 2013, the Company entered into a $4 billion Amended and Restated Five Year Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks. Commitments under the Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. The Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes. There have been no borrowings under the Credit Agreement. During 2014, the Company repurchased $924 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. In December 2013, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $5 billion of Honeywell common stock, $4.1 billion remained available as of December 31, 2014 for additional share repurchases. In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, dividends, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments. Specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2015 to be as follows: ##TABLE_START    Capital expenditureswe expect to spend approximately $1.3 billion for capital expenditures in 2015 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement.    Share repurchasesunder the Companys share repurchase program, $4.1 billion is available as of December 31, 2014 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities.    Dividendswe increased our dividend rate by 15% to $.5175 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2014 dividend. The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2015.    Asbestos claimswe expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $350 million and $30 million, respectively, in 2015.    Pension contributionsin 2015, we are not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans. We plan to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $140 million ($109 million of marketable securities were contributed in January 2015) to our non-U.S. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. The timing and amount of contributions to both our U.S. and non-U.S. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans.    Repositioning actionswe expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute repositioning actions will approximate $150 million in 2015.    Environmental remediation costswe expect to spend approximately $275 million in 2015 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs. ##TABLE_END We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2014 and 2013, we realized $160 million and $3 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from sales of non-strategic businesses. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines, access to the public debt and equity markets, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. Contractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments Following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2014: ##TABLE_START                         Total(6)  Payments by Period  Thereafter  2015  2016- 2017  2018- 2019 Long-term debt, including capitalized leases(1)  $  6,985   $    $    $  1,807   $  3,277  Interest payments on long-term debt, including capitalized leases   3,349    303    552    414    2,080  Minimum operating lease payments   1,281    330    470    224    257  Purchase obligations(2)   1,643    953    472    158    60  Estimated environmental liability payments(3)   591    278    218    75    20  Asbestos related liability payments(4)   1,552    352    737    413    50  Asbestos insurance recoveries(5)   (485 )    (31 )    (112 )    (105 )    (237 )               $  14,916   $  3,124   $  3,299   $  2,986   $  5,507             ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  (1)  Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity.  (2)  Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements.

(4)  These amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2014. See Asbestos Matters in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.  (5)  These amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos related liabilities as of December 31, 2014. See Asbestos Matters in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.  (6)  The table excludes tax effects as well as $659 million of uncertain tax positions. See Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Financial Statements for additional information. ##TABLE_END Environmental Matters Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $268 million, $272 million and $234 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, in both 2014 and 2013 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $88 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations. Spending related to known environmental matters was $321 million, $304 million and $320 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and is estimated to be approximately $275 million in 2015. We expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a numbers of factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of our environmental matters. Financial Instruments The following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at December 31, 2014 and 2013. ##TABLE_START            Face or Notional Amount  Carrying Value(1)  Fair Value(1)  Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value(2) December 31, 2014         Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments         Long-term debt (including current maturities)  $  6,985   $  (6,985 )   $  (7,817 )   $  (478 )  Interest rate swap agreements   1,100    93    93    (69 )  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments         Foreign currency exchange contracts(3)   7,291    10    10    86  December 31, 2013         Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments         Long-term debt (including current maturities)  $  7,433   $  (7,433 )   $  (8,066 )   $  (466 )  Interest rate swap agreements   1,700    55    55    (77 )  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments         Foreign currency exchange contracts(3)   7,298    (7 )    (7 )    296  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  (1)  Asset or (liability).

(3)  Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions. ##TABLE_END See Note 14 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Contingent Liabilities We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies. Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries Honeywells involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust through 2018. In light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims from January 2002 through the effective date of the NARCO Trust on April 30, 2013, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. Annual pension (income) expense is comprised of a potential mark-to-market adjustment (MTM Adjustment) and service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets and prior service amortization (Pension Ongoing (Income) Expense). The key assumptions used in developing our 2014, 2013 and 2012 net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following: ##TABLE_START          2014  2013  2012 Discount rate   4.89 %    4.06 %    4.89 %  Assets:       Expected rate of return   7.75 %    7.75 %    8 %  Actual rate of return   8 %    23 %    13 %  Actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return   8 %    8 %    8 %  ##TABLE_END The MTM Adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor. Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM charges were $249 million, $51 million and $957 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). We plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% for 2015 as this is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and the asset mix of the plans investments. The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We will use a 4.08% discount rate in 2015, reflecting the significant decline in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end. In addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment: ##TABLE_START      Change in Assumption  Impact on 2015 Pension Ongoing Expense  Impact on PBO 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate  Decrease $14 million  Increase $542 million 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate  Increase $13 million  Decrease $515 million 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets  Increase $41 million   0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets  Decrease $41 million   ##TABLE_END Pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately $385 million in 2015 compared with pension ongoing income of $254 million in 2014. The increase in pension ongoing income in 2015 compared with 2014 results primarily from lower interest cost due to a decline in discount rates at December 31, 2014 compared with December 31, 2013 and an increase in the plans assets at December 31, 2014 compared with December 31, 2013 mainly due to strong asset returns in 2014. Also, if required, an MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2015, and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. Long-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets) The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations; ##TABLE_END 30 ##TABLE_START    Annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line;    Significant negative industry or economic trends; or    Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. ##TABLE_END Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates, our assumptions as to volume, selling prices and costs, and the discount rate selected. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions. Income Taxes On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. Our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. Sales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts In 2014, we recognized approximately 15% of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts in our Aerospace, ACS and PMT segments. These long-term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting Principles The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is a description of Honeywells significant accounting policies. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. Our consolidation policy requires equity investments that we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investees activities to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Redeemable noncontrolling interest is considered to be temporary equity and is therefore reported outside of permanent equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the greater of the initial carrying amount adjusted for the noncontrolling interests share of net income (loss) or its redemption value. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding assets useful life. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2014 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. Other Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years. Sales Recognition Product and service sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities in our Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) segments, are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts in the Aerospace, ACS and Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT) segments are recorded on a percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident. Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis. Amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services. Environmental We accrue costs related to environmental matters when it is probable that we have incurred a liability related to a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies. Aerospace Sales Incentives We provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of our aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and braking system hardware, avionics, and auxiliary power units, for installation on commercial aircraft. These incentives consist of free or deeply discounted products, credits for future purchases of product and upfront cash payments. These costs are recognized in the period incurred as cost of products sold or as a reduction to sales, as appropriate. Research and Development Research and development costs for company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred. Such costs are principally included in Cost of Products Sold and were $1,892 million, $1,804 million and $1,847 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Plans The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 18 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs). The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and are based on our historical forfeiture rates. Pension Benefits We recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment), and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered. The remaining components of pension (income) expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recognized on a quarterly basis (Pension ongoing (income) expense). Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings. Derivative Financial Instruments We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the form of accounting standards updates (ASUs) to the FASBs Accounting Standards Codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of time value of money in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers. The guidance is effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016 (early adoption is not permitted). The guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. Note 2. Divestiture In 2014, the Company sold its Friction Materials business to Federal Mogul Corporation for $155 million and recognized a pre-tax and after-tax loss of $33 million (of which $5 million was HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) recognized in 2014). The sale of Friction Materials, which was part of the Transportation Systems business, is consistent with the Companys strategic focus on its portfolio of differentiated global technologies. Following the closing of the sale, the Company announced the realignment of its Transportation Systems business segment with its Aerospace business segment. Under the realigned segment reporting structure, the Company has three business segments: Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions and Performance Materials and Technologies.

The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives, factory transitions in our ACS and Aerospace segments to more cost-effective locations, and site consolidations and HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) organizational realignments of businesses in our ACS and PMT segments. Also, $38 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, mainly in our Aerospace and ACS segment were returned to income in 2014 due principally to the change in scope of a previously announced repositioning action and to fewer employee severance actions caused by higher attrition than originally planned associated with prior severance programs. In 2013, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $231 million including severance costs of $186 million related to workforce reductions of 3,081 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives, achieving acquisition-related synergies in our ACS segment, outsourcing of non-core components in our Aerospace segment, the shutdown of a manufacturing facility in our PMT segment, and factory transitions in our ACS segment to more cost-effective locations. Also, $30 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, in our ACS and PMT segments were returned to income in 2013 due to changes in the scope of previously announced repositioning actions, lower than expected costs in completing the exit of a product line and fewer employee severance actions caused by higher attrition than originally planned associated with prior severance programs. In 2012, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $119 million including severance costs of $91 million related to workforce reductions of 2,204 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to the planned shutdown of a manufacturing facility in our Aerospace segment, the exit from a product line in our PMT segment, and cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. Also, $66 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, in our ACS, Aerospace and PMT segments were returned to income in 2012 due primarily to fewer employee severance actions caused by higher attrition than originally planned associated with prior severance programs and changes in the scope of previously announced repositioning actions.

The decrease was primarily attributable to lower tax expense from the resolution of audits, partially offset by the impact of more income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates and additional reserves. The Companys non-U.S. effective tax rate for 2014 was 21.3%, an increase of approximately 2.3 percentage points compared to 2013. The increase in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily attributable to additional reserves and the impact of more income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates, partially offset by the tax impact of dispositions. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to overall non-U.S. earnings taxed at lower rates. The effective tax rate increased by 2.4 percentage points in 2013 compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to lower mark-to-market pension expense in the U.S. Other factors causing an increase in the effective tax rate include higher tax expense related to an increase in tax reserves and higher state tax expense. These increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by tax benefits from retroactive law changes in the U.S. The Companys non-U.S. effective tax rate for 2013 was 19.0%, an increase of approximately 2.0 percentage points compared to 2012. The increase in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily attributable to higher expense related to retroactive tax law changes in Germany and additional reserves in various jurisdictions, coupled with higher earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to overall non-U.S. earnings taxed at lower rates. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Deferred tax assets (liabilities) The tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which give rise to future income tax benefits and payables are as follows: ##TABLE_START      Deferred tax assets:  December 31,  2014  2013 Pension  $    $   Postretirement benefits other than pensions   441    499  Asbestos and environmental   477    437  Employee compensation and benefits   387    382  Other accruals and reserves   672    702  Net operating and capital losses   639    838  Tax credit carryforwards   199    266       Gross deferred tax assets   3,388    3,156  Valuation allowance   (560 )    (614 )       Total deferred tax assets  $  2,828   $  2,542       Deferred tax liabilities:     Property, plant and equipment  $  (612 )   $  (654 )  Intangibles   (1,060 )    (1,126 )  Other asset basis differences   (286 )    (350 )  Other   (7 )    (22 )       Total deferred tax liabilities   (1,965 )    (2,152 )       Net deferred taxes  $    $        ##TABLE_END The net deferred tax assets are included as components of Current and Non-Current Deferred Income Taxes and Accrued Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our net deferred tax asset of $863 million consists of $305 million related to non-U.S. operations which are comprised principally of net deductible temporary differences and net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards (mainly in Canada and the United Kingdom). We maintain a valuation allowance of $557 million against a portion of the non-U.S. gross deferred tax assets. Our valuation allowance decreased by $54 million in 2014, increased by $16 million in 2013 and increased by $7 million in 2012. The amount of the change in the valuation allowance that was credited to income tax expense for 2014 was $10 million and the amounts charged to income tax expense for 2013 and 2012 were $49 million and $18 million, respectively. In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income tax expense in the period that such determination is made. As of December 31, 2014, our net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards were as follows: ##TABLE_START               Jurisdiction  Expiration Period  Net Operating and Capital Loss Carryforwards  Tax Credit Carryforwards U.S. Federal   2032   $    $   U.S. State   2034    2,200    35  Non-U.S.   2034    2,463    148         Total    $  4,664   $          ##TABLE_END 45 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Many jurisdictions impose limitations on the timing and utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In those instances whereby there is an expected permanent limitation on the utilization of the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward the deferred tax asset and amount of the carryforward have been reduced. U.S. federal income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of the vast majority of our international subsidiaries as it is our intention to reinvest these earnings into the respective subsidiaries. At December 31, 2014 Honeywell has not provided for U.S. federal income and non-U.S. withholding taxes on approximately $15.0 billion of such earnings of our non-U.S. operations. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability. ##TABLE_START                 2014  2013  2012 Change in unrecognized tax benefits:       Balance at beginning of year  $    $    $   Gross increases related to current period tax positions   65    41    25  Gross increases related to prior periods tax positions   204    118    44  Gross decreases related to prior periods tax positions   (277 )    (21 )    (62 )  Decrease related to resolutions of audits with tax authorities   (32 )    (92 )    (40 )  Expiration of the statute of limitations for the assessment of taxes   (10 )    (30 )    (64 )  Foreign currency translation   (20 )    (9 )    4         Balance at end of year  $    $    $          ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 there were $659 million, $729 million and $722 million of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would be recorded as a component of income tax expense.

In addition, the outcome of these HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods. Unrecognized tax benefits for examinations in progress were $403 million, $431 million and $443 million, as of December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of Tax Expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and totaled $24 million, $17 million and $37 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties were $325 million, $301 million and $284 million, as of December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Note 6.

Note 14. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Credit and Market Risk Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers. Foreign Currency Risk Management We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. Our primary objective is to preserve the U.S. Dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows and earnings. We attempt to hedge currency exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts with third parties. We hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in Other (Income) Expense. We partially hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which predominantly occur in the next twelve months and are denominated in non-functional currencies, with currency forward contracts. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the currency forward contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. Open foreign currency exchange forward contracts mature predominantly in the next twelve months. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had contracts with notional amounts of $7,291 million and $7,298 million, respectively, to exchange HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) foreign currencies, principally the Euro, U.S. Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Mexican Peso, Chinese Renminbi, Indian Rupee, British Pound, Czech Koruna and Swiss Franc. Interest Rate Risk Management We use a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively changed $1,100 million and $1,700 million, respectively, of fixed rate debt at rates of 4.00 and 3.96, respectively, to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Our interest rate swaps mature at various dates through 2023. Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The FASBs accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The FASBs guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy: ##TABLE_START    Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or   Unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or   Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability Level 3  Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability ##TABLE_END Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2014 and 2013: ##TABLE_START        December 31,  2014  2013 Assets:     Foreign currency exchange contracts  $    $   Available for sale investments   1,479    826  Interest rate swap agreements   93    63  Liabilities:     Foreign currency exchange contracts  $    $   Interest rate swap agreements       8  ##TABLE_END The foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2. The Company holds investments in marketable equity securities that are designated as available for sale and are valued using quoted market prices. As such, these investments are classified within level 1. The Company also holds investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale and are valued using market transactions in over-the-counter markets. As such, these investments are classified within level 2. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) approximates fair value. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were not carried at fair value: ##TABLE_START                     December 31, 2014  December 31, 2013  Carrying Value  Fair Value  Carrying Value  Fair Value Assets         Long-term receivables  $    $    $    $   Liabilities         Long-term debt and related current maturities  $  6,985   $  7,817   $  7,433   $  8,066  ##TABLE_END The Company determined the fair value of the long-term receivables by discounting based upon the terms of the receivable and counterparty details including credit quality. As such, the fair value of these receivables is considered level 2. The Company determined the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities utilizing transactions in the listed markets for identical or similar liabilities. As such, the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities is considered level 2 as well. We enter into transactions that are subject to arrangements designed to provide for netting of offsetting obligations in the event of the insolvency or default of a counterparty. However, we have not elected to offset multiple contracts with a single counterparty, therefore the fair value of the derivative instruments in a loss position is not offset against the fair value of derivative instruments in a gain position. Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or (losses) on the derivative recognized in Interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt being hedged. Gains on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $38 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Losses on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $91 million in the year ended 2013. Gains and losses are fully offset by losses and gains on the underlying debt being hedged. We also economically hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts. These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. We recognized $181 million of expense and $162 million of income, in Other (Income) Expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See Note 4 Other (Income) Expense for further details of the net impact of these economic foreign currency hedges. Note 15.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans Under the terms of the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (the Plan) there were 19,752,482, shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants at December 31, 2014. Additionally, under the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (the Directors Plan) there were 107,995 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants at December 31, 2014. Stock Options The exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under our stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of our stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employees requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Compensation cost on a pre-tax basis related to stock options recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $85 million, $70 million and $65 million, respectively. The associated future income tax benefit recognized in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $31 million, $24 million and $23 million, respectively. The following table sets forth fair value per share information, including related weighted-average assumptions, used to determine compensation cost: ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2014  2013  2012 Weighted average fair value per share of options granted during the year(1)  $  16.35   $  11.85   $  13.26  Assumptions:       Expected annual dividend yield   2.05 %    2.55 %    2.57 %  Expected volatility   23.06 %    24.73 %    30.36 %  Risk-free rate of return   1.48 %    0.91 %    1.16 %  Expected option term (years)   5.0    5.5    5.8  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  (1)  Estimated on date of grant using Black-Scholes option-pricing model. ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes information about stock option activity for the three years ended December 31, 2014: ##TABLE_START        Number of Options  Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at December 31, 2011   38,916,370   $  43.01  Granted   5,788,734    59.86  Exercised   (8,347,313 )    36.52  Lapsed or canceled   (788,770 )    49.76     Outstanding at December 31, 2012   35,569,021    47.13  Granted   6,041,422    69.89  Exercised   (10,329,611 )    41.91  Lapsed or canceled   (616,995 )    53.84     Outstanding at December 31, 2013   30,663,837    53.27  Granted   5,823,706    93.95  Exercised   (5,697,263 )    47.47  Lapsed or canceled   (1,294,668 )    67.70     Outstanding at December 31, 2014   29,495,612   $  61.80     Vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2014(1)   28,015,623   $  60.44     Exercisable at December 31, 2014   16,019,742   $  49.40     ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  (1)  Represents the sum of vested options of 16.0 million and expected to vest options of 12.0 million.

Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded liabilities for environmental costs: ##TABLE_START                 Years Ended December 31,  2014  2013  2012 Beginning of year  $    $    $   Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable   268    272    234  Environmental liability payments   (321 )    (304 )    (320 )  Other   1    21    17         End of year  $    $    $          ##TABLE_END Environmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts: ##TABLE_START          December 31,    2014  2013 Accrued liabilities  $    $    Other liabilities   313    339         $    $         ##TABLE_END We do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined although they could be material to our consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, NY We are implementing a combined dredging/capping remedy of Onondaga Lake pursuant to a consent decree approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York in January 2007. We have accrued for our estimated cost of remediating Onondaga Lake based on currently available information and analysis performed by our engineering consultants. Honeywell is also conducting remedial investigations and activities at other sites in Syracuse. We have recorded reserves for these investigations and activities where appropriate, consistent with the accounting policy described above. Honeywell has entered into a cooperative agreement with potential natural resource trustees to assess alleged natural resource damages relating to this site. It is not possible to predict the outcome or duration of this assessment, or the amounts of, or responsibility for, any damages. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix) business, which was sold in 2014, manufactured automotive brake parts that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form.

Both Honeywell and NARCO are protected by a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based on exposure to NARCO products to be made against the NARCO Trust. The NARCO Trust reviews submitted claims and determines award amounts in accordance with established Trust Distribution Procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court which set forth the criteria claimants must meet to qualify for compensation including, among other things, exposure and medical criteria that determine the award amount. In addition, Honeywell provided, and continues to provide, input to the design of control procedures for processing NARCO claims, and has on-going audit rights to review and monitor the claims processors adherence to the established requirements of the Trust Distribution Procedures. Honeywell is obligated to fund NARCO asbestos claims submitted to the NARCO Trust which qualify for payment under the Trust Distribution Procedures (Annual Contribution Claims), subject to annual caps of $140 million in the years 2015 through 2018 and $145 million for each year thereafter. However, the initial $100 million of claims processed through the NARCO Trust (the Initial Claims Amount) will not count against the annual cap and any unused portion of the Initial Claims Amount will roll over to subsequent years until fully utilized. As of December 31, 2014, Honeywell has not made any payments to the NARCO Trust for Annual Contribution Claims. Honeywell is also responsible for payments due to claimants pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and Trust Distribution Procedures criteria (Pre-established Unliquidated Claims), which amounts are estimated at $150 million and are expected to be paid during the initial years of trust operations ($3 million of which was paid in 2014). Such payments are not subject to the annual cap described above. Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for pre-established unliquidated claims ($147 million), unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection ($39 million) and for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust through 2018 ($743 million). In the absence of actual trust experience on which to base the estimate, Honeywell projected the probable value of asbestos related future liabilities, including trust claim handling costs, based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts. Some critical assumptions underlying this methodology include claims filing rates, disease criteria and payment values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures, estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances. This projection resulted in a range of estimated liability of $743 million to $961 million. We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) projections and in connection with the recent implementation of the Trust Distribution Procedures by the NARCO Trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims which remained in place throughout NARCOs Chapter 11 case, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Our insurance receivable corresponding to the estimated liability for pending and future NARCO asbestos claims reflects coverage which reimburses Honeywell for portions of NARCO-related indemnity and defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. We conduct analyses to estimate the probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos claims. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. We made judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the NARCO-related asbestos liabilities or assets to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. Given the uncertainties, we review our estimates periodically, and update them based on our experience and other relevant factors. Similarly, we will reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability or other developments that may impact insurance recoveries.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of pending (claims actually filed as of the financial statement date) and future Bendix-related asbestos claims. We have valued Bendix pending and future claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix pending and future claims during the fourth quarter each year. The liability for future claims represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury claims expected to be asserted against Bendix over the next five years. Such estimated cost of future Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. The methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims is similar to that used to estimate the liability for future NARCO-related asbestos claims. Our insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of pending and future Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the solvency of our insurers, judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with our insurers. Honeywell believes it has sufficient insurance coverage and reserves to cover all pending Bendix-related asbestos claims and Bendix-related asbestos claims estimated to be filed within the next five years. Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of either pending or future Bendix-related asbestos claims, we do not believe that such claims would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position in light of our insurance coverage and our prior experience in resolving such claims. If the rate and types of claims filed, the average resolution value of such claims and the period of time over which claim settlements are paid (collectively, the Variable Claims Factors) do not substantially change, Honeywell would not expect future Bendix-related asbestos claims to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in any fiscal year. No assurances can be given, however, that the Variable Claims Factors will not change. Other Matters We are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Included in these other matters are the following: Honeywell v. United Auto Workers (UAW) et. al In July 2011, Honeywell filed an action in federal court (District of New Jersey) against the UAW and all former employees who retired under a series of Master Collective Bargaining Agreements (MCBAs) between Honeywell and the UAW seeking a declaratory judgment that certain express limitations on its obligation to contribute toward the healthcare coverage of such retirees (the CAPS) set forth in the MCBAs may be implemented, effective January 1, 2012. The UAW and certain retiree defendants filed a mirror suit in the Eastern HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) District of Michigan alleging that the MCBAs do not provide for CAPS on the Companys liability for healthcare coverage. The New Jersey action was dismissed and Honeywell subsequently answered the UAWs complaint in Michigan and asserted counterclaims for fraudulent inducement, negligent misrepresentation and breach of implied warranty. The UAW filed a motion to dismiss these counterclaims. The court dismissed Honeywells fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation claims, but let stand the claim for breach of implied warranty. In the second quarter of 2014, the parties agreed to stay the proceedings with respect to those retirees who retired before the initial inclusions of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA until the Supreme Court decided the MG Polymers USA, LLC v. Tackett case. In the Tackett case, the Supreme Court had to resolve a split between the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, on the one hand, and the majority of other U.S. Court of Appeals, on the other hand, as to whether retiree health insurance benefits provided in collective bargaining agreements carry an inference that they are vested or guaranteed to continue for life where the agreement is silent as to their duration. In a ruling on January 26, 2015, the Supreme Court held that no such inference of vesting is appropriate, substantially bolstering Honeywells position in this litigation. Honeywell is confident that the CAPS will be upheld and that its liability for healthcare coverage premiums with respect to the putative class will be limited as negotiated and expressly set forth in the applicable MCBAs. In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywells other postretirement benefits for pre-2003 retirees would increase by approximately $180 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS. In December 2013, the UAW and certain of the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment with respect to those retirees who retired after the initial inclusion of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA. The UAW sought a ruling that the 2003 MCBA did not limit Honeywells obligation to contribute to healthcare coverage for the post-2003 retirees. That motion remains pending. Honeywell is confident that the Court will find that the 2003 MCBA does, in fact, limit Honeywells retiree healthcare obligation for post-2003 retirees. In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywells other postretirement benefits for post- 2003 retirees would increase by approximately $120 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS. Joint Strike Fighter Investigation In 2013 the Company received subpoenas from the Department of Justice requesting information relating primarily to parts manufactured in the United Kingdom and China used in the F-35 fighter jet. The Company is cooperating fully with the investigation. While we believe that Honeywell has complied with all relevant U.S. laws and regulations regarding the manufacture of these sensors, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the investigation or what action, if any, may result from it. Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations (including the specific matters referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above). Considering our past experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. Pension benefits for substantially all U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywells U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. Less than 1% of Honeywells U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company; and this subsidy is limited to a fixed-dollar amount. In addition, more than 75% of Honeywells current retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

To determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments. We use the average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Our expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 7.75% is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations. We review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. For non-U.S. benefit plans actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country. Pension Benefits Included in the aggregate data in the tables above are the amounts applicable to our pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets. Amounts related to such plans were as follows: ##TABLE_START            December 31,  U.S. Plans  Non-U.S. Plans  2014  2013  2014  2013 Projected benefit obligation  $    $    $  1,686   $   Accumulated benefit obligation  $    $    $  1,584   $   Fair value of plan assets  $    $    $    $   ##TABLE_END Accumulated benefit obligation for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $17.2 billion and $15.7 billion and for our Non-U.S. defined benefit plans were $5.5 billion and $5.3 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our asset investment strategy for our U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve our long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. Our actual invested positions in various securities change over time based on short and longer- term investment opportunities. To achieve our objectives, we have established long-term target allocations as follows: 60%-70% equity securities, 10%-20% fixed income securities and cash, 5%-15% real estate investments, and 10%-20% other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located both inside and outside the United States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies. We review our assets on a regular basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations. Our non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing standard funding and investment guidance. Local regulations, local funding rules, and local financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. While our non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country, the long-term investment objectives are generally the same as those for the U.S. pension assets. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

At December 31, 2014 and 2013, our non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $65 million and $61 million, respectively. In both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is primarily related to outstanding equity futures contracts. Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgages, asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in commingled funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals. Our general funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made in 2014 and 2013. In 2012 we made voluntary contributions of $792 million to our U.S. pension plans primarily to improve the funded status. We are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2015. In 2014, contributions of $160 million were made to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. In 2015, we expect to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $140 million to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Contributions for both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets. Benefit payments, including amounts to be paid from Company assets, and reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows: ##TABLE_START        U.S. Plans  Non-U.S. Plans  $  1,133   $   2016   1,104    200  2017   1,103    205  2018   1,117    211  2019   1,132    217  2020-2024   5,799    1,187  ##TABLE_END Other Postretirement Benefits ##TABLE_START        December 31,  2014  2013 Assumed health care cost trend rate:     Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year   7.00 %    7.00 %  Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to   5.00 %    5.00 %  Year that the rate reaches the rate it is assumed to remain at   2023    2019  ##TABLE_END The assumed health care cost trend rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported.

Segment Financial Data We globally manage our business operations through three reportable operating segments. Segment information is consistent with how management reviews the businesses, makes investing and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance. Honeywells senior management evaluates segment performance based on segment profit. Segment profit is measured as business unit income (loss) before taxes excluding general corporate unallocated expense, other income (expense), interest and other financial charges, pension and other postretirement benefits (expense), stock compensation expense, repositioning and other charges and accounting changes. In April 2014, the Company announced the realignment of our Honeywell Process Solutions business from Automation and Control Solutions into Performance Materials and Technologies. The Company has reported its financial performance based on the inclusion of Honeywell Process Solutions in Performance Materials and Technologies for all periods presented. In July 2014, following the closing of the sale of its Friction Materials business, the Company announced the realignment of its Transportation Systems business segment with its Aerospace business segment. Under the realigned segment reporting structure, the Company has three business segments: Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions and Performance Materials and Technologies. The Company has reported its financial performance based on the inclusion of Transportation Systems in Aerospace for all periods presented. These realignments have no impact on the Companys historical consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2014  2013  2012 Net Sales       Aerospace       Product  $  10,773   $  10,798   $  10,560  Service   4,825    4,937    5,041         Total   15,598    15,735    15,601  Automation and Control Solutions       Product   13,219    12,253    11,581  Service   1,268    1,212    1,206         Total   14,487    13,465    12,787  Performance Materials and Technologies       Product   8,406    8,163    7,671  Service   1,815    1,692    1,606         Total   10,221    9,855    9,277           $  40,306   $  39,055   $  37,665         Depreciation and amortization       Aerospace  $    $    $   Automation and Control Solutions   306    302    302  Performance Materials and Technologies   284    336    265  Corporate   57    61    63           $    $    $          Segment Profit       Aerospace  $  2,915   $  2,870   $  2,711  Automation and Control Solutions   2,200    1,983    1,836  Performance Materials and Technologies   1,817    1,725    1,550  Corporate   (236 )    (227 )    (218 )           $  6,696   $  6,351   $  5,879               ##TABLE_END 77 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey February 13, 2015 ", "9A": " Item 9A.

RSUs included in column (a) of the table represent the full number of RSUs awarded and outstanding whereas the number of shares of common stock ##TABLE_END 82 ##TABLE_START    to be issued upon vesting will be lower than what is reflected on the table because the value of shares required to meet employee statutory minimum tax withholding requirements are not issued.    2,969,601 growth plan units were issued and remain outstanding for the performance cycles commencing January 1, 2012 and January 1, 2014 pursuant to the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan. The ultimate value of any growth plan award may be paid in cash or shares of common stock and, thus, growth plan units are not included in the table above.    Because the number of future shares that may be distributed to employees participating in the Honeywell Global Stock Plan is unknown, no shares attributable to that plan are included in column (a) of the table above.  (2)  Column (b) relates to stock options and does not include any exercise price for RSUs because an RSUs value is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals or continued employment or service and they are settled for shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis.  (3)  The number of shares that may be issued under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2014 is 19,752,482 which includes the following additional shares that may again be available for issuance: shares that are settled for cash, expire, are canceled, or under similar prior plans, are tendered as option exercise price or tax withholding obligations, are reacquired with cash option exercise price or with monies attributable to any tax deduction enjoyed by Honeywell to the exercise of an option, or are under any outstanding awards assumed under any equity compensation plan of an entity acquired by Honeywell. No securities are available for future issuance under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 1994 Non-Employee Director Plan.    The number of shares that may be issued under the Honeywell Global Stock Plan as of December 31, 2014 is 2,047,756. This plan is an umbrella plan for three plans described below maintained solely for eligible employees of participating non-U.S. countries.    The UK Sharebuilder Plan, allows an eligible UK employee to invest taxable earnings in common stock. The Company matches those shares and dividends paid are used to purchase additional shares of common stock. For the year ending December 31, 2014, 74,256 shares were credited to participants accounts under the UK Sharebuilder Plan.    The Honeywell International Technologies Employees Share Ownership Plan (Ireland) and the Honeywell Measurex (Ireland) Limited Group Employee Profit Sharing Scheme, allow eligible employees in Ireland to contribute specified percentages of base pay, bonus or performance pay that are then invested in common stock. For the year ending December 31, 2014, 11,583 shares of common stock were credited to participants accounts under these two plans.    The remaining 107,995 shares included in column (c) are shares remaining for future grants under the 2006 Non-Employee Director Plan.  (4)  Equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners included in the table refer to the Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees.    The Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees is an unfunded, non-tax qualified plan that provides benefits equal to the employee deferrals and company matching allocations that would have been provided under Honeywells U.S. tax-qualified savings plan if the Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and contributions did not apply. The Company matching contribution is credited to participants accounts in the form of notional shares of common stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of common stock. The number of shares to be issued under this plan based on the value of the notional shares as of December 31, 2014 is 505,494.    The AlliedSignal Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Employees was a cash incentive compensation plan maintained by AlliedSignal Inc. This plan has expired. Employees were permitted to defer receipt of a cash bonus payable under the plan and invest the deferred bonus in notional shares of common stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of common stock.

Competition We are subject to competition in substantially all product and service areas. Some of our key competitors are: ##TABLE_START    Aerospace: Borg-Warner (automotive), Garmin, General Electric, Rockwell Collins, Thales and United Technologies    ACS: 3M, Johnson Controls, Schneider, Siemens and Zebra-Motorola    PMT: Albemarle, BASF, Dow, Dupont, Emerson and Sinopec ##TABLE_END Our businesses compete on a variety of factors, such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of OEMs. Aerospace Sales Our sales to aerospace customers were 39%, 39%, and 40% of our total sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Our sales to commercial aerospace OEMs were 8%, 6%, and 7% of our total sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013. In addition, our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 12%, 11%, and 11% of our total sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013. U.S. Government Sales Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by Aerospace), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $3,743 million, $3,693 million and $3,856 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a prime contractor and subcontractor, of $2,680 million, $2,792 million and $3,066 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. U.S. defense spending decreased in 2015 compared to 2014. We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2016 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEMs production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs), increases in direct foreign defense and space market sales, as well as our diversified commercial businesses. Backlog Our total backlog at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $18,183 million and $18,313 million. We anticipate that approximately $11,601 million of the 2015 backlog will be filled in 2016. We believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option. International Operations We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development globally. U.S. exports and non-U.S. manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 14% of our total sales in each of 2015, 2014 and 2013. Non-U.S. manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 39% of our total sales in 2015, and 41% in 2014 and 2013. ##TABLE_START        Manufactured Products and Systems and Performance of Services  Year Ended December 31, 2015  Aerospace  ACS  PMT   (% of Total Sales) U.S. Exports   22 %    3 %    20 %  Non-U.S.   29 %    48 %    40 %  ##TABLE_END Raw Materials The principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available. Although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply, we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2015. We are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials, except related to R240 (a key component in foam blowing agents), a raw material used in PMT. The costs of certain key raw materials, including cumene, natural gas, R240, sulfur, fluorspar, ethylene and perchloroethylene in PMT and nickel, steel, titanium and other metals in Aerospace, are expected to continue to fluctuate. We will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2016. Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business. Research and Development The Companys principal research and development activities are in the U.S., India, Europe and China. Research and development (RD) expense totaled $1,856 million, $1,892 million and $1,804 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. RD expense was 5% of sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Customer-sponsored (principally by the U.S. Government) RD activities amounted to an additional $998 million, $1,034 million and $969 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Environment We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is also possible that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys National Priority List. Although there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, to date we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole. We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Companys business or markets that it serves, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. Employees We have approximately 129,000 employees at December 31, 2015, of whom approximately 49,000 are located in the United States. Executive Officers of the Registrant The executive officers of Honeywell, listed as follows, are elected annually by the Board of Directors. There are no family relationships among them. ##TABLE_START    Name, Age, Date First Elected an Executive Officer  Business Experience David M.

Risk Factors Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements We describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Results of Operations and in other parts of this report (including this Item 1A). Such discussions contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Risk Factors Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Macroeconomic and Industry Risks Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations. ##TABLE_START    Aerospace Operating results of Aerospace are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, as well as changes in customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions and capacity constraints. The operating results of our Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial Aftermarket business units may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and global flying hours, which impact business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results in our Defense and Space Systems business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs. Operating results in our Transportation Systems business unit may be affected by the level of production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products and delays in launch schedules for new automobile and truck platforms.    ACS Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation, industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion, and inventory levels in distribution channels.    PMT Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply volatility, and our ability to maximize our facilities production capacity and minimize downtime. In particular, the volatility in oil and natural gas prices have and will continue to impact our customers operating levels and capital spending and thus demand for our products and ##TABLE_END 6 ##TABLE_START    services. Pricing of certain chemical products are driven by raw materials that are correlated to the price of oil, hence revenue could be significantly impacted by volatility in the price of oil. ##TABLE_END An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations. Our international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Companys sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes), violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate these risks), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. Operating outside of the United States also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss. Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. Operational Risks Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities. The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in PMT (cumene, fluorspar, R240, natural gas, perchloroethylene, sulfur and ethylene) and Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations. Many major components, product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies, (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions, and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities or, with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins. Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products and defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors including many new and non- traditional competitors, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses. Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. As a supplier of military and other equipment to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unusual risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future. We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third party service providers including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. Legal and Regulatory Risks Our U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including multi- jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the guidelines provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to address base erosion and profit shifting, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income taxes. Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety, performance and product certification regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial Aftermarket may be impacted by, among other things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations, while emissions, fuel economy and energy efficiency standards for motor vehicles can impact Transportation Systems. Within ACS, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. PMTs results of operations can be affected by environmental, safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, import and export matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Honeywells common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Market and dividend information for Honeywells common stock is included in Note 24 Unaudited Quarterly Financial Information of Notes to Financial Statements. The number of record holders of our common stock at December 31, 2015 was 53,230. Honeywell purchased 1,724,212 shares of its common stock, par value $1 per share, in the quarter ending December 31, 2015. Under the Companys previously reported $5 billion share repurchase program, $2.2 billion remained available as of December 31, 2015 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of our operating, financing and other investing activities.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Honeywell International Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (Honeywell or the Company) for the three years ended December 31, 2015. All references to Notes relate to Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2015, Honeywell successfully navigated a challenging macro-economic climate by combining strategic growth in our diverse portfolio and our well-known cost discipline with a marked acceleration of our capital deployment strategy. Earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution, grew 13% to $6.04 per share in 2015 and net income attributable to Honeywell grew 12% to $4,768 million. Our balanced long-term focus on enhancing shareowner value resulted in segment margin expansion of 220 basis points versus 2014 without sacrificing seed planting intended to ensure future growth, including maintaining RD spending at 5% of sales, new product introductions aligned with global macroeconomic trends in energy, safety and security and productivity, $216 million of repositioning investments to improve our operations and increased investment in High Growth Regions. Honeywell Operating System (HOS) Gold and Honeywell User Experience (HUE) initiatives intensified throughout the company, driving productivity through sustainable improvements to our factories, footprints and supply chain. In 2015 we deployed capital of over $10 billion, including the following: ##TABLE_START    Mergers and Acquisitions we deployed over $5 billion during 2015, acquiring businesses that will be integrated into each of our three operating segments. These acquisitions all share a technology focus and increase our existing deep alignment with enduring macro trends such as energy efficiency, clean energy generation, safety and security, urbanization and customer productivity.    Dividend after a 15% dividend rate increase in 2014, we again increased our annual dividend rate by 15% in 2015, as we seek to grow the dividend faster than earnings.    Share Repurchases we continue to opportunistically repurchase our shares with the goal of generally keeping share count flat and seeking to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans. In 2015, we repurchased 18.8 million shares for $1.9 billion.    Capital Investment in Facilities we invested over $1 billion in high return capital expenditures, focused on revenue growth projects such as our Solstice low global-warming potential refrigerant products for the automotive industry and catalyst products in UOP. ##TABLE_END CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales ##TABLE_START          2015  2014  2013 Net sales  $  38,581   $  40,306   $  39,055  % change compared with prior period   (4 )%    3 %    ##TABLE_END 15 The change in net sales is attributable to the following: ##TABLE_START        2015 Versus 2014  2014 Versus 2013 Volume   1%    3%  Price   (1)%      Acquisitions/Divestitures   (1)%    1%  Foreign Currency Translation   (4)%      Other   1%    (1)%          (4)%    3%       ##TABLE_END A discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this MDA. The foreign currency translation impact is principally driven by the weakening of the Euro and Canadian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar. Cost of Products and Services Sold ##TABLE_START          2015  2014  2013 Cost of products and services sold  $  26,747   $  28,957   $  28,364  % change compared with prior period   (8 )%    2 %    Gross Margin percentage   30.7 %    28.2 %    27.4 %  ##TABLE_END Cost of products and services sold decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 principally due to a decrease in direct and indirect material costs of approximately $1,460 million (driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, productivity, lower raw materials pass-through pricing and the absence of the Friction Materials business, partially offset by higher sales volume), a decrease in labor costs of approximately $450 million and higher pension income of approximately $230 million. Gross margin percentage increased in 2015 compared with 2014 principally due to higher gross margin in all of our business segments (approximately 2.0 percentage point impact collectively) and increased pension income allocated to cost of products and services sold (approximately 0.5 percentage point impact). Cost of products and services sold increased in 2014 compared with 2013 principally due to an increase in direct material and labor costs of approximately $645 million (driven by higher sales volume and acquisitions, net of divestitures) and an increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $35 million, partially offset by a decrease in repositioning and other charges of approximately $40 million. Gross margin percentage increased in 2014 compared with 2013 principally due to higher gross margin in all of our business segments (approximately 0.7 percentage point impact collectively) and lower repositioning and other charges (approximately 0.1 percentage point impact), partially offset by higher pension and other postretirement benefit expense (approximately 0.1 percentage point impact). Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ##TABLE_START          2015  2014  2013 Selling, general and administrative expense  $  5,006   $  5,518   $  5,190  % of sales   13.0 %    13.7 %    13.3 %  ##TABLE_END Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily driven by the favorable impact from foreign currency translation, increased pension income, decreased indirect costs and benefits from repositioning, partially offset by increased labor costs (primarily merit increases and investment for growth). SGA increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily driven by an increase in labor costs (primarily acquisitions, incentive compensation, merit increases and investment for growth) and an increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense, partially offset by a decrease in repositioning charges. Tax Expense ##TABLE_START          2015  2014  2013 Tax expense  $  1,739   $  1,489   $  1,450  Effective tax rate   26.4 %    25.6 %    26.8 %  ##TABLE_END For discussion of changes in the effective tax rate, see Note 5 Income Taxes in the Notes to Financial Statements. The effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 are lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lower tax rates on non-U.S. earnings, the vast majority of which we intend to permanently reinvest outside the United States. The Company currently expects the effective tax rate for 2016 to be approximately 26.5%. The effective tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to unusual or infrequently occurring items, the resolution of income tax audits, changes in tax laws or other items such as pension mark-to-market adjustments. Net Income Attributable to Honeywell ##TABLE_START          2015  2014  2013 Net income attributable to Honeywell  $  4,768   $  4,239   $  3,924  Earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution  $  6.04   $  5.33   $  4.92  ##TABLE_END Earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution increased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily driven by increased segment profit in each of our business segments and lower pension and other postretirement expense, partially offset by increased tax expense and lower other income (principally due to the absence of a realized gain related to the prior year sale of marketable equity securities). Earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to increased segment profit in each of our business segments and lower repositioning and other charges, partially offset by higher pension and other postretirement expense and increased tax expense. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Our consolidated results are principally impacted by: ##TABLE_START    Change in global economic growth rates and industry conditions and demand in our key end markets;    Overall sales mix, in particular the mix of Aerospace original equipment and aftermarket sales and the mix of ACS products, distribution and services sales;    The impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (in particular the Euro), relative to the U.S. Dollar;    The extent to which cost savings from productivity actions are able to offset or exceed the impact of material and non-material inflation; and    The impact of the pension discount rate and asset returns on pension expense, including mark-to-market adjustments, and funding requirements. ##TABLE_END Our 2016 areas of focus are supported by the Honeywell Enablers, including HOS Gold, are generally applicable to each of our operating segments and include: ##TABLE_START    Driving profitable growth through RD, technological excellence and optimized manufacturing capability to deliver innovative products that customers value;    Expanding margins by maintaining and improving the Companys cost structure through manufacturing and administrative process improvements, repositioning, and other actions, which will drive productivity and enhance the flexibility of the business as it works to proactively respond to changes in end market demand; ##TABLE_END 17 ##TABLE_START    Driving strong cash flow conversion through effective working capital management which will enable the Company to deploy capital for strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures and returning cash to shareholders;    Driving organic growth through expansion of our localized footprint in high growth regions, including China, India, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Latin America;    Executing disciplined, rigorous MA and integration processes to deliver inorganic growth through previously announced acquisitions while also identifying appropriate acquisitions to further deploy our capital effectively;    Aligning and prioritizing capital expenditures for long-term growth, while considering short-term demand volatility;    Actively monitoring trends in the oil and gas industry end markets, principally the demand from midstream and downstream customers for products and services provided by Process Solutions and UOP;    Monitoring both suppliers and customers for signs of liquidity constraints, limiting exposure to any resultjing inability to meet delivery commitments or pay amounts due, and identifying alternate sources of supply as necessary;    Proactively managing raw material costs through formula and long-term supply agreements and hedging activities, where feasible and prudent; and    Controlling corporate and other non-operating costs, including costs incurred for asbestos and environmental matters, pension and other post-retirement expenses and tax expense. ##TABLE_END Review of Business Segments ##TABLE_START              Years Ended December 31,  % Change  2015 Versus 2014  2014 Versus 2013  2015  2014  2013 Aerospace Sales           Commercial Original Equipment  $  2,905   $  2,607   $  2,651    11 %    (2 )%  Commercial Aftermarket   4,656    4,578    4,459    2 %    3 %  Defense and Space   4,715    4,754    4,870    (1 )%    (2 )%  Transportation Systems   2,961    3,659    3,755    (19 )%    (3 )%         Total Aerospace Sales   15,237    15,598    15,735      Automation and Control Solutions Sales           Energy Safety  Security   9,544    9,738    8,756    (2 )%    11 %  Building Solutions  Distribution   4,565    4,749    4,709    (4 )%    1 %         Total Automation and Control Solutions Sales   14,109    14,487    13,465      Performance Materials and Technologies Sales           UOP   2,976    3,195    2,962    (7 )%    8 %  Process Solutions   2,749    3,122    3,091    (12 )%    1 %  Advanced Materials   3,510    3,904    3,802    (10 )%    3 %         Total Performance Materials and Technologies Sales   9,235    10,221    9,855             Net Sales  $  38,581   $  40,306   $  39,055             ##TABLE_END 18 Aerospace ##TABLE_START              2015  2014  Change  2013  Change Net sales  $  15,237   $  15,598    (2 )%   $  15,735    (1 )%  Cost of products and services sold   11,068    11,699      11,889    Selling, general and administrative expenses   643    712      705    Other   308    272      271             Segment profit  $  3,218   $  2,915    10 %   $  2,870    2 %           ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START          Factors Contributing to Year-Over-Year Change  2015 vs. 2014  2014 vs. 2013  Sales  Segment Profit  Sales  Segment Profit Organic growth/ Operational segment profit   2 %    8 %    2 %    8 %  Foreign currency translation   (3 )%    (4 )%          Acquisitions, divestitures and other, net    (1 )%     6 %     (3 )%     (6 )%           Total % Change   (2 )%    10 %    (1 )%    2 %           ##TABLE_END 2015 compared with 2014 Aerospace sales decreased primarily due to the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and the Friction Materials divestiture, partially offset by an increase in organic sales, as discussed below, and a decrease in incentives predominantly to air transport and regional aviation original equipment manufacturers (OEM Incentives). ##TABLE_START    Commercial Original Equipment sales increased by 11% (increased 5% organic) primarily driven by a decrease in OEM Incentives and higher business and general aviation engine shipments.    Commercial Aftermarket sales increased by 2% (increased 2% organic) primarily driven by higher repair and overhaul activities, partially offset by lower retrofits, modifications and upgrades for business and general aviation customers.    Defense and Space sales decreased by 1% (flat organic) primarily due to lower U.S. government revenue, partially offset by growth in international programs.    Transportation Systems sales decreased by 19% (increased 3% organic) primarily due to the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and the Friction Materials divestiture, partially offset by continued growth from new platform launches and higher global turbo gas penetration. ##TABLE_END Aerospace segment profit increased primarily due to an 8% increase in operational segment profit and a 6% favorable impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other (predominantly the absence of higher prior year OEM Incentives), as discussed above, partially offset by a 4% unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily driven by productivity, net of inflation, and favorable pricing, partially offset by continued investments for growth. Cost of products and services sold decreased primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, the Friction Materials divestiture, and productivity, net of inflation, partially offset by continued investments for growth. 2014 compared with 2013 Aerospace sales decreased primarily due to the Friction Materials divestiture and an increase in OEM incentives, partially offset by an increase in organic sales, as discussed below. ##TABLE_START    Commercial Original Equipment sales decreased by 2% (increased by 3% organic) primarily due to an increase in OEM Incentives to air transport and regional original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), partially offset by higher air transport volumes, consistent with the OEMs higher production rates, and business and general aviation engine shipments.    Commercial Aftermarket sales increased by 3% driven primarily by higher sales of spare parts to air transport and regional customers, partially offset by a decline in retrofits, modifications and ##TABLE_END 19 ##TABLE_START    upgrades and lower repair and overhaul activities for our business and general aviation customers.    Defense and Space sales decreased by 2% primarily due to lower U.S. government services revenue and the absence of a prior year royalty gain, partially offset by growth in international programs.    Transportation Systems sales decreased by 3% (increased by 5% organic) primarily due to the Friction Materials divestiture, partially offset by continued growth from new platform launches, higher global turbo gas penetration and increased commercial vehicle demand in Europe. ##TABLE_END Aerospace segment profit increased primarily due to an 8% increase in operational segment profit, partially offset by a 6% unfavorable impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other (predominantly higher OEM Incentives and the absence of a prior year royalty gain), as discussed above. The increase in operational segment profit is driven primarily by favorable price and productivity, net of inflation. Cost of products and services sold decreased primarily due to the factors discussed above (excluding price).

Organic sales growth was primarily due to increased sales volumes, most significantly in Security and Fire across all regions, as well as Sensing  Productivity Solutions.    Sales in Building Solutions  Distribution decreased by 4% (increased by 2% organic) principally due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Organic sales growth was primarily due to increased sales volume in Americas Distribution partially offset by softness in the project installation and U.S. energy retrofit businesses, which is expected to continue. ##TABLE_END ACS segment profit increased due to an increase in operational segment profit and acquisitions, net of divestitures partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily due to the positive impact of price and productivity net of inflation and higher organic sales volumes partially offset by continued investments for growth. Cost of products and services decreased primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and productivity partially offset by higher organic sales volume and inflation. 2014 compared with 2013 ACS sales increased primarily due to growth from acquisitions, net of divestitures and organic sales growth, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. ##TABLE_START    Sales in Energy, Safety  Security increased by 11% (4% organic) principally due to (i) acquisitions, net of divestitures, (ii) higher global sales volumes in our Environmental  Energy Solutions business driven by strong U.S. residential market conditions and new product introductions, (iii) increases in sales volumes in our Security and Fire and Industrial Safety businesses driven by organic growth in all regions and (iv) increases in sales volumes in our Sensing  Productivity Solutions business in the second half of 2014.    Sales in Building Solutions  Distribution increased by 1% (2% organic) principally due to increased sales volumes in our Americas Distribution business partially offset by softness in the U.S. energy retrofit business. Building Solutions backlog increased in 2014. ##TABLE_END ACS segment profit increased due to an increase in operational segment profit and acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily the result of higher sales volumes as discussed above, and the positive impact of price and productivity, net of inflation partially offset by continued investment for growth. Cost of products and services sold increased primarily due to higher sales volume, acquisitions, net of divestitures and inflation, partially offset by productivity and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.

Process Solutions sales decreased 12% (decreased 3% organic) driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and lower volumes primarily due to weakness in projects and field products, which is expected to moderate during 2016.    Advanced Materials sales decreased 10% (decreased 7% organic) primarily driven by lower raw material pass-through pricing and unplanned plant outages in Resins and Chemicals partially offset by increased volumes in Fluorine Products. We anticipate volatility in raw materials pass-through pricing to continue in 2016 primarily in Resins and Chemicals where sales fluctuate with the market price of certain raw materials, which are correlated to the price of oil. ##TABLE_END 21 PMT segment profit increased due to an increase in operational segment profit partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily due to price and productivity net of inflation partially offset by lower organic sales volumes and continued investments for growth. Cost of products and services sold decreased primarily due to the favorable impacts of inflation, foreign currency translation, lower organic sales volumes and productivity, partially offset by continued investments for growth. 2014 compared with 2013 PMT sales increased due to an increase in organic sales partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. ##TABLE_START    UOP sales increased by 8% driven primarily by higher catalyst and gas processing volumes partially offset by lower equipment and service revenues in the first nine months. Catalyst sales decreased in the fourth quarter due to the timing of shipments as well as stronger volume growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to 2014 which was partially offset by increased licensing revenues.    Sales in our Process Solutions business increased by 1% (4% organic) driven primarily by volume growth in advanced solutions software and services and field products partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation, predominately in the fourth quarter. Project and service orders and backlog increased in 2014.    Advanced Materials sales increased by 3% primarily driven by increased volume in Fluorine Products and Resins and Chemicals, partially offset by unfavorable pricing most significantly in Fluorine Products and lower raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins and Chemicals. We anticipate lower raw materials pass-through pricing to continue in 2015 primarily in Resins and Chemicals where sales fluctuate with the market price of certain raw materials, which are correlated to the price of oil. ##TABLE_END PMT segment profit increased due to an increase in operational segment profit partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily due to higher sales volumes, as discussed above, and productivity, net of inflation partially offset by unfavorable Advanced Materials pricing, continued investment for growth and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Cost of products and services sold increased primarily due to higher volume and continued investment for growth partially offset by productivity, net of inflation and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Repositioning Charges See Note 3 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2015, 2014 and 2013. These repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of $175 million to $200 million in 2016 compared with 2015 principally from planned workforce reductions. Cash spending related to our repositioning actions was $118 million, $161 million and $160 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, and was funded through operating cash flows. In 2016, we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately $175 million and to be funded through operating cash flows. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. We continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. Cash Flow Summary Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows: ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2015  2014  2013 Cash provided by (used for):       Operating activities  $  5,454   $  5,024   $  4,335  Investing activities   (6,514 )    (1,876 )    (1,959 )  Financing activities   102    (2,272 )    (433 )  Effect of exchange rate changes on cash   (546 )    (339 )    (155 )         Net increase in cash and cash equivalents  $  (1,504 )   $    $  1,788         ##TABLE_END 2015 compared with 2014 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $430 million primarily due to a $489 million favorable impact from working capital and a $382 million increase in net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, partially offset by (i) a $175 million decrease in customer advances and deferred income, (ii) $151 million in OEM incentives and (iii) increased cash tax payments of $50 million. Cash used for investing activities increased by $4,638 million primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $5,224 million, most significantly the Elster Division of Melrose Industries plc (Elster), and a decrease in proceeds of $159 million, primarily from the Friction Materials divestiture, partially offset by a net $659 million decrease in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities. Cash provided by financing activities increased by $2,374 million primarily due to an increase in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $3,648 million, partially offset by an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $1,039 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of $216 million. 2014 compared with 2013 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $689 million primarily due to (i) a $508 million increase of net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, (ii) reduced net payments for repositioning and other charges of $233 million primarily due to the collection of a $130 million asbestos receivable due from one of our insurance carriers and lower asbestos related payments of $98 million, (iii) reduced cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $131 million and (iv) lower cash tax payments of approximately $129 million, partially offset by a $93 million unfavorable impact from working capital primarily driven by higher inventory to support sales growth. Cash used for investing activities decreased by $83 million primarily due to a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $1,129 million most significantly Intermec and RAE Systems, Inc. in 2013 and an increase in proceeds from the sales of businesses of $157 million (most significantly Friction Materials), partially offset by (i) a net $688 million increase in investments primarily short-term marketable securities, (ii) an increase of approximately $371 million in settlement payments of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and (iii) a $147 million increase in expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Cash used for financing activities increased by $1,839 million primarily due to a decrease in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $1,589 million, an increase in cash dividends paid of $157 million and lower net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $33 million. Liquidity Each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. Considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies, including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity. In addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. At December 31, 2015, a substantial portion of the Companys cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. If the amounts held outside of the U.S. were to be repatriated, under current law, they would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest the vast majority of these funds outside of the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability. We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. A source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings and commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 0.26% and 0.60%. Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2015, Standard and Poors (SP), Fitch, and Moodys have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1. SP, Fitch and Moodys have Honeywells rating outlook as stable. To date, the Company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity. We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions. During 2015, the Company entered into credit agreements with a syndicate of banks. See Note 12 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion on the credit agreements. During 2015, the Company repurchased $1,884 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. In December 2013, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $5 billion of Honeywell common stock, $2.2 billion remained available as of December 31, 2015 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including future option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, dividends, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments. Specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2016 to be as follows: ##TABLE_START    Capital expenditureswe expect to spend approximately $1.1 billion for capital expenditures in 2016 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement.    Share repurchasesunder the Companys share repurchase program, $2.2 billion is available as of December 31, 2015 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities.    Dividendswe increased our dividend rate by 15% to $.5950 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2015 dividend. The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2016.    Asbestos claimswe expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $295 million and $25 million in 2016.    Pension contributionsin 2016, we are not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans. We plan to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $160 million ($106 million of marketable securities were contributed in January 2016) to our non-U.S. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. The timing and amount of contributions to both our U.S. and non-U.S. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans.    Repositioning actionswe expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute repositioning actions will approximate $175 million in 2016.    Environmental remediation costswe expect to spend approximately $250 million in 2016 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs.    Acquisitionswe acquired the remaining 30 percent noncontrolling interest in UOP Russell LLC for approximately $240 million in January 2016. In addition, in February 2016 we acquired COM DEV International for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $330 million and entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Xtralis International Holdings Limited for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $480 million. ##TABLE_END We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2015 and 2014, we realized $1 million and $160 million in cash proceeds from sales of non-strategic businesses. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines, access to the public debt and equity markets, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. Contractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments Following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2015: ##TABLE_START              Total(6)  Payments by Period  Thereafter  2016  2017- 2018  2019- 2020 Long-term debt, including capitalized leases(1)  $  6,131   $    $  1,400   $    $  3,250  Interest payments on long-term debt, including capitalized leases   3,047    290    494    344    1,919  Minimum operating lease payments   1,201    316    421    191    273  Purchase obligations(2)   1,980    962    623    392    3  Estimated environmental liability payments(3)   518    253    190    55    20  Asbestos related liability payments(4)   1,543    292    775    382    94  Asbestos insurance recoveries(5)   (449 )    (23 )    (110 )    (103 )    (213 )               $  13,971   $  2,667   $  3,793   $  2,165   $  5,346             ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  (1)  Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity.  (2)  Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements.  (3)  The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2015.  (4)  These amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2015. See Asbestos Matters in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.  (5)  These amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos related liabilities as of December 31, 2015. See Asbestos Matters in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.  (6)  The table excludes tax liability payments, including those for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Financial Statements for additional information. ##TABLE_END Environmental Matters Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $194 million, $268 million and $272 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. In addition, in 2015 and 2014 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $90 million and $88 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations. Spending related to known environmental matters was $273 million, $321 million and $304 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013 and is estimated to be approximately $250 million in 2016. We expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a numbers of factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of our environmental matters. Financial Instruments The following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at December 31, 2015 and 2014. ##TABLE_START            Face or Notional Amount  Carrying Value(1)  Fair Value(1)  Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value(2) December 31, 2015         Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments         Long-term debt (including current maturities)  $  6,131   $  (6,131 )   $  (6,721 )   $  (407 )  Interest rate swap agreements   1,100    92    92    (59 )  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments         Foreign currency exchange contracts(3)   10,538    11    11    (153 )  December 31, 2014         Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments         Long-term debt (including current maturities)  $  6,985   $  (6,985 )   $  (7,817 )   $  (478 )  Interest rate swap agreements   1,100    93    93    (69 )  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments         Foreign currency exchange contracts(3)   7,291    10    10    86  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  (1)  Asset or (liability).  (2)  A hypothetical immediate one percentage point decrease in interest rates across all maturities and a potential change in fair value of foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities will result in a change in fair value equal to the inverse of the amount disclosed in the table.  (3)  Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions. ##TABLE_END See Note 14 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion on the agreements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Contingent Liabilities We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies. Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries Honeywells involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust through 2018. In light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims from January 2002 through the effective date of the NARCO Trust on April 30, 2013, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. Annual pension (income) expense is comprised of a potential mark-to-market adjustment (MTM Adjustment) and service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets and prior service amortization (Pension Ongoing (Income) Expense). The key assumptions used in developing our 2015, 2014 and 2013 net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following: ##TABLE_START          2015  2014  2013 Discount rate   4.08 %    4.89 %    4.06 %  Assets:       Expected rate of return   7.75 %    7.75 %    7.75 %  Actual rate of return   2 %    8 %    23 %  Actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return   7 %    8 %    8 %  ##TABLE_END The MTM Adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor. Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM charges were $67 million, $249 million and $51 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). We plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% for 2016 as this is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and the asset mix of the plans investments. The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We will use a 4.46% discount rate as of December 31, 2015, reflecting the increase in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end. In addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment: ##TABLE_START      Change in Assumption  Impact on 2016 Pension Ongoing Expense  Impact on PBO 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate  Decrease $19 million  Increase $490 million 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate  Increase $17 million  Decrease $470 million 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets  Increase $40 million   0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets  Decrease $40 million   ##TABLE_END Pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately $580 million in 2016 compared with pension ongoing income of $430 million in 2015. The expected increase is primarily due to lower service and interest costs resulting mainly from the change in our discount rate methodology as described in Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Financial Statements and the plan amendment in the fourth quarter of 2015 to freeze final average compensation in our U.S. pension plans as of December 31, 2015 partially offset by the impact of lower asset returns in 2015. Also, if required, an MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2016, and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. Long-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets) The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations;    Annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line;    Significant negative industry or economic trends; or    Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. ##TABLE_END Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates, our assumptions as to volume, selling prices and costs, and the discount rate selected. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions. Income Taxes On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. Our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. Sales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts In 2015, we recognized approximately 14% of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts. These long-term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting Principles The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is a description of Honeywells significant accounting policies. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. Our consolidation policy requires equity investments that we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investees activities to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Redeemable noncontrolling interest is considered to be temporary equity and is therefore reported outside of permanent equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the greater of the initial carrying amount adjusted for the noncontrolling interests share of net income (loss) or its redemption value. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding assets useful life. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2015 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. Other Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years. Sales Recognition Product and service sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts are recorded on a percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident. Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis. Amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services. Environmental We accrue costs related to environmental matters when it is probable that we have incurred a liability related to a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies. Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. In connection HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies. Aerospace Sales Incentives We provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of our aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and braking system hardware, avionics, and auxiliary power units, for installation on commercial aircraft. These incentives consist of free or deeply discounted products, credits for future purchases of product and upfront cash payments. These costs are recognized in the period incurred as cost of products sold or as a reduction to sales, as appropriate. Research and Development Research and development costs for company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred. Such costs are principally included in cost of products sold and were $1,856 million, $1,892 million and $1,804 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Stock-Based Compensation Plans The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 18 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units. The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and are based on our historical forfeiture rates. Pension Benefits We recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment), and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered. The remaining components of pension (income) expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recognized on a quarterly basis (Pension ongoing (income) expense). Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. Dollars are translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings. Derivative Financial Instruments We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract. All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements We consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes by permitting classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company has elected to early adopt the guidance on a prospective basis effective with the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. This is a change from the Companys historical presentation whereby certain deferred tax assets and liabilities were classified as current and the remainder were classified as non-current. Adoption of the guidance resulted in a reclassification of $662 million from current assets and $32 million from current liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of time value of money in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers. The effective date was deferred for one year to the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective dateinterim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016. The guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.

Acquisitions During 2015, we acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash acquired) of $5,244 million. On December 29, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the Elster Division of Melrose Industries plc (Elster), a leading provider of thermal gas solutions for commercial, industrial, and residential heating systems and gas, water, and electricity meters, including smart meters and software and data analytics solutions, for an aggregate value, net of cash acquired, of approximately $4,899 million. Elster had 2015 revenues of approximately $1,670 million and will primarily be integrated into ACS. The following amounts represent the preliminary determination of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed that are included in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. ##TABLE_START    Current assets  $   Intangible assets   2,463  Other noncurrent assets   179  Current liabilities   (658 )  Noncurrent liabilities   (836 )     Net assets acquired   1,680  Noncontrolling interest   (3 )  Goodwill   3,222     Purchase Price  $  4,899     ##TABLE_END The identifiable intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, trade names and technology that are being amortized over their estimated lives ranging from 1 to 20 years using straight line and accelerated amortization methods. The goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. The results from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2015 were included principally in ACS and were not material to the consolidated results of operations. As of December 31, 2015, the purchase accounting for Elster is subject to final adjustment primarily for the valuation of useful lives of intangible assets, amounts allocated to intangible assets and goodwill, tax balances and for certain pre-acquisition contingencies. In January 2016, the Company acquired the remaining 30 percent noncontrolling interest in UOP Russell LLC, which develops technology and manufactures modular equipment to process natural gas, for approximately $240 million. In February 2016, the Company acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of COM DEV International (COM DEV), a leading satellite and space components provider, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $330 million. COM DEV, a public company in Canada, operates globally and had reported 2015 revenues of approximately $180 million. COM DEV will be integrated into Aerospace. In February 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Xtralis International Holdings Limited (Xtralis), a leading global provider of aspiration smoke detection and perimeter security technologies, for approximately $480 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016, pending regulatory approvals. Xtralis will be integrated into ACS. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. Also, $53 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, mainly in Aerospace and ACS, were returned to income in 2015 due principally to higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments, and changes in scope of previously announced repositioning actions. In 2014, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $184 million including severance costs of $156 million related to workforce reductions of 2,975 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives, factory transitions in ACS and Aerospace to more cost-effective locations, and site consolidations and organizational realignments of businesses in ACS and PMT. Also, $38 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, mainly in Aerospace and ACS, were returned to income in 2014 due principally HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) to the change in scope of a previously announced repositioning action and higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments. In 2013, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $231 million including severance costs of $186 million related to workforce reductions of 3,081 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives, achieving acquisition-related synergies in ACS, outsourcing of non-core components in Aerospace, the shutdown of a manufacturing facility in PMT, and factory transitions in ACS to more cost-effective locations. Also, $30 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, in ACS and PMT, were returned to income in 2013 due to changes in the scope of previously announced repositioning actions, lower than expected costs in completing the exit of a product line and higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments.

The increase was primarily attributable to decreased tax benefits from the resolution of tax audits, partially offset by increased tax benefits from manufacturing incentives, the impact of more income in jurisdictions with lower tax rates and fewer reserves. The Companys non-U.S. effective tax rate for 2015 was 19.5%, a decrease of approximately 1.8 percentage points compared to 2014. The year-over-year decrease in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily attributable to higher earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions coupled with lower expense related to reserves in various jurisdictions, partially offset by an increase from the tax impact of restructuring and dispositions. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to overall non-U.S. earnings taxed at lower rates. The effective tax rate decreased by 1.2 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower tax expense from the resolution of audits, partially offset by the impact of more income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates and additional reserves. The Companys non-U.S. effective tax rate for 2014 was 21.3%, an increase of approximately 2.3 percentage points compared to 2013. The increase in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily attributable to additional reserves and the impact of more income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates, partially offset by the tax impact of dispositions. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to overall non-U.S. earnings taxed at lower rates. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

The change in deferred tax balance was primarily attributable to deferred tax liabilities for intangible assets that were recorded in connection with the acquisition of Elster. Our gross deferred tax asset includes $1,049 million related to non-U.S. operations comprised principally of deductible temporary differences and net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards (mainly in Canada, France, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom). We maintain a valuation allowance of $587 million against a portion of the non-U.S. gross deferred tax assets. The change in the valuation allowance resulted in an increase of $114 million, decrease of $10 million and increase of $49 million to income tax expense in 2015, 2014 and 2013. In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a reduction to income tax expense in the period that such determination is made. As of December 31, 2015, our net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards were as follows: ##TABLE_START        Jurisdiction  Expiration Period  Net Operating and Capital Loss Carryforwards  Tax Credit Carryforwards U.S. Federal  2032  $    $   U.S. State  2034   1,315    25  Non-U.S.  2035   517    131  Non-U.S.  Indefinite   2,339                $  4,173   $          ##TABLE_END 45 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Many jurisdictions impose limitations on the timing and utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In those instances whereby there is an expected permanent limitation on the utilization of the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward the deferred tax asset and amount of the carryforward have been reduced. U.S. federal income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of the vast majority of our international subsidiaries as it is our intention to reinvest these earnings into the respective subsidiaries. At December 31, 2015 Honeywell has not provided for U.S. federal income and non-U.S. withholding taxes on approximately $16.6 billion of such earnings of our non-U.S. operations. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability. ##TABLE_START          2015  2014  2013 Change in unrecognized tax benefits:       Balance at beginning of year  $    $    $   Gross increases related to current period tax positions   56    65    41  Gross increases related to prior periods tax positions   175    204    118  Gross decreases related to prior periods tax positions   (72 )    (277 )    (21 )  Decrease related to resolutions of audits with tax authorities   (11 )    (32 )    (92 )  Expiration of the statute of limitations for the assessment of taxes   (13 )    (10 )    (30 )  Foreign currency translation   (29 )    (20 )    (9 )         Balance at end of year  $    $    $          ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 there were $765 million, $659 million and $729 million of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would be recorded as a component of income tax expense.

In addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods. Unrecognized tax benefits for examinations in progress were $349 million, $403 million and $431 million, as of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.

Note 14. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Credit and Market Risk Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers. Foreign Currency Risk Management We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. Our primary objective is to preserve the U.S. Dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows and earnings. We attempt to hedge currency exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts with third parties. We hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in Other (Income) Expense. We partially hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which predominantly occur in the next twelve months and are denominated in non-functional currencies, with currency forward contracts. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the currency forward contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. Open foreign currency exchange forward contracts mature predominantly in the next twelve months. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had contracts with notional amounts of $10,538 million and $7,291 million to exchange foreign HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) currencies, principally the U.S. Dollar, Euro, British Pound, Chinese Renminbi, Indian Rupee, Mexican Peso, Canadian Dollar, U.A.E. Dirham and Singapore Dollar. We have also designated foreign currency debt as hedges against portions of our net investment in foreign operations during the year ended December 31, 2015. Gains or losses on the effective portion of the foreign currency debt designated as a net investment hedge are recorded in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. The Company did not have ineffectiveness related to net investment hedges during the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest Rate Risk Management We use a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively changed $1,100 million of fixed rate debt at rate of 4.00 to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Our interest rate swaps mature at various dates through 2023. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The FASBs accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014: ##TABLE_START       December 31,  2015  2014 Assets:     Foreign currency exchange contracts  $    $   Available for sale investments   1,501    1,479  Interest rate swap agreements   92    93  Liabilities:     Foreign currency exchange contracts  $    $   ##TABLE_END The foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale and are valued using published prices based off observable market data. As such, these investments are classified within level 2. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were not carried at fair value: ##TABLE_START           December 31, 2015  December 31, 2014  Carrying Value  Fair Value  Carrying Value  Fair Value Assets         Long-term receivables  $    $    $    $   Liabilities         Long-term debt and related current maturities  $  6,131   $  6,721   $  6,985   $  7,817  ##TABLE_END The Company determined the fair value of the long-term receivables by discounting based upon the terms of the receivable and counterparty details including credit quality. As such, the fair value of these receivables is considered level 2. The Company determined the fair value of the long-term debt HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) and related current maturities utilizing transactions in the listed markets for identical or similar liabilities. As such, the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities is considered level 2 as well. Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or losses on the derivative recognized in Interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt being hedged. Losses on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Gains on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $38 million in the year ended 2014. Gains and losses are fully offset by losses and gains on the underlying debt being hedged. We also economically hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts. These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. We recognized $86 million and $181 million of expense, in other (income) expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. See Note 4 Other (Income) Expense for further details of the net impact of these economic foreign currency hedges. Note 15.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans Under the terms of the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (2011 Plan) there were 14,050,760 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants at December 31, 2015. Additionally, the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (2006 Directors Plan) expires on April 24, 2016 and it is expected that no future grants will be made under the 2006 Directors Plan prior to expiration. In 2016, the Company is seeking shareowner approval of a new employee stock plan and non-employee director plan and, upon approval, no additional grants will be permitted under the 2011 Plan or the 2006 Directors Plan. Stock Options The exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under our stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of our stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employees requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Compensation cost on a pre-tax basis related to stock options recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $78 million, $85 million and $70 million. The associated future income tax benefit recognized in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $26 million, $31 million and $24 million. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded liabilities for environmental costs: ##TABLE_START         Years Ended December 31,  2015  2014  2013 Beginning of year  $    $    $   Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable   194    268    272  Environmental liability payments   (273 )    (321 )    (304 )  Other   6    1    21         End of year  $    $    $          ##TABLE_END Environmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts: ##TABLE_START          December 31,    2015  2014 Accrued liabilities  $    $    Other liabilities   265    313         $    $         ##TABLE_END We do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined although they could be material to our consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, NY We are implementing a combined dredging/capping remedy of Onondaga Lake pursuant to a consent decree approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York in January 2007. We have accrued for our estimated cost of remediating Onondaga Lake based on currently available information and analysis performed by our engineering consultants. Honeywell is also conducting remedial investigations and activities at other sites in Syracuse. We have recorded reserves for these investigations and activities where appropriate, consistent with the accounting policy described above. Honeywell has entered into a cooperative agreement with potential natural resource trustees to assess alleged natural resource damages relating to this site. It is not possible to predict the outcome or duration of this assessment, or the amounts of, or responsibility for, any damages. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Asbestos Matters Honeywell is a defendant in asbestos related personal injury actions related to two predecessor companies: ##TABLE_START    North American Refractories Company (NARCO), which was sold in 1986, produced refractory products (bricks and cement used in high temperature applications). Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing refractory products in an occupational setting.    Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix) business, which was sold in 2014, manufactured automotive brake parts that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form.

Both Honeywell and NARCO are protected by a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products to be made against the NARCO Trust. The NARCO Trust reviews submitted claims and determines award amounts in accordance with established Trust Distribution Procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court which set forth the criteria claimants must meet to qualify for compensation including, among other things, exposure and medical criteria that determine the award amount. In addition, Honeywell provided, and continues to provide, input to the design of control procedures for processing NARCO claims, and has on-going audit rights to review and monitor the claims processors adherence to the established requirements of the Trust Distribution Procedures. Honeywell is obligated to fund NARCO asbestos claims submitted to the NARCO Trust which qualify for payment under the Trust Distribution Procedures (Annual Contribution Claims), subject to annual caps of $140 million in the years 2016 through 2018 and $145 million for each year thereafter. However, the initial $100 million of claims processed through the NARCO Trust (the Initial Claims Amount) will not count against the annual cap and any unused portion of the Initial Claims Amount will roll over to subsequent years until fully utilized. In 2015, Honeywell filed suit against the NARCO Trust in Bankruptcy Court alleging breach of certain provisions of the Trust Agreement and Trust Distribution Procedures. The proceeding is ongoing. As of December 31, 2015, Honeywell has not made any payments to the NARCO Trust for Annual Contribution Claims. Honeywell is also responsible for payments due to claimants pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and Trust Distribution Procedures criteria (Pre-established Unliquidated Claims), which amounts are estimated at $150 million and are expected to be paid during the initial years of trust operations ($5 million of which has been paid since the effective date of the NARCO Trust). Such payments are not subject to the annual cap described above. Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for pre-established unliquidated claims ($145 million), unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection ($33 million) and for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust through 2018 ($743 million). In the absence of actual trust experience on which to base the estimate, Honeywell projected the probable value of asbestos related future liabilities, including trust claim handling costs, based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts. Some critical assumptions underlying this methodology include claims filing rates, disease criteria and payment values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures, estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances. This projection resulted in a range of estimated HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) liability of $743 million to $961 million. We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections and in connection with the recent implementation of the Trust Distribution Procedures by the NARCO Trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims which remained in place throughout NARCOs Chapter 11 case, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Our insurance receivable corresponding to the estimated liability for pending and future NARCO asbestos claims reflects coverage which reimburses Honeywell for portions of NARCO-related indemnity and defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. We conduct analyses to estimate the probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos claims. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. We made judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the NARCO-related asbestos liabilities or assets to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. Given the uncertainties, we review our estimates periodically, and update them based on our experience and other relevant factors. Similarly, we will reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability or other developments that may impact insurance recoveries.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of pending (claims actually filed as of the financial statement date) and future Bendix-related asbestos claims. We have valued Bendix pending and future claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix pending and future claims during the fourth quarter each year. The liability for future claims represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury claims expected to be asserted against Bendix over the next five years. Such estimated cost of future Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. The methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims is similar to that used to estimate the liability for future NARCO-related asbestos claims. Our insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of pending and future Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the solvency of our insurers, judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with our insurers. Honeywell believes it has sufficient insurance coverage and reserves to cover all pending Bendix-related asbestos claims and Bendix-related asbestos claims estimated to be filed within the next five years. Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of either pending or future Bendix-related asbestos claims, we do not believe that such claims would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position in light of our insurance coverage and our prior experience in resolving such claims. If the rate and types of claims filed, the average resolution value of such claims and the period of time over which claim settlements are paid (collectively, the Variable Claims Factors) do not substantially change, Honeywell would not expect future Bendix-related asbestos claims to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in any fiscal year. No assurances can be given, however, that the Variable Claims Factors will not change. Other Matters We are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Included in these other matters are the following: Honeywell v. United Auto Workers (UAW) et. al In July 2011, Honeywell filed an action in federal court (District of New Jersey) against the UAW and all former employees who retired under a series of Master Collective Bargaining Agreements (MCBAs) between Honeywell and the UAW seeking a declaratory judgment that certain express limitations on its obligation to contribute toward the healthcare coverage of such retirees (the CAPS) set forth in the MCBAs may be implemented, effective January 1, 2012. The UAW and certain retiree defendants filed a mirror suit in the Eastern HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) District of Michigan alleging that the MCBAs do not provide for CAPS on the Companys liability for healthcare coverage. The New Jersey action was dismissed and Honeywell subsequently answered the UAWs complaint in Michigan and asserted counterclaims for fraudulent inducement, negligent misrepresentation and breach of implied warranty. The UAW filed a motion to dismiss these counterclaims. The court dismissed Honeywells fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation claims, but let stand the claim for breach of implied warranty. In the second quarter of 2014, the parties agreed to stay the proceedings with respect to those retirees who retired before the initial inclusions of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA until the Supreme Court decided the MG Polymers USA, LLC v. Tackett case. In a ruling on January 26, 2015, the Supreme Court held that retiree health insurance benefits provided in collective bargaining agreements do not carry an inference that they are vested or guaranteed to continue for life and that the vesting issue must be decided pursuant to ordinary principles of contract law. The stay of the proceedings has been lifted and the case is again proceeding in the normal course. Based on the Supreme Courts ruling, Honeywell is confident that the CAPS will be upheld and that its liability for healthcare coverage premiums with respect to the putative class will be limited as negotiated and expressly set forth in the applicable MCBAs. In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywells other postretirement benefits for pre-2003 retirees would increase by approximately $176 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS. In December 2013, the UAW and certain of the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment with respect to those retirees who retired after the initial inclusion of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA. The UAW sought a ruling that the 2003 MCBA did not limit Honeywells obligation to contribute to healthcare coverage for the post-2003 retirees. That motion remains pending. Honeywell is confident that the Court will find that the 2003 MCBA does, in fact, limit Honeywells retiree healthcare obligation for post-2003 retirees. In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywells other postretirement benefits for post- 2003 retirees would increase by approximately $110 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS. Joint Strike Fighter Investigation In 2013 the Company received subpoenas from the Department of Justice requesting information relating primarily to parts manufactured in the United Kingdom and China used in the F-35 fighter jet. The Company is cooperating fully with the investigation. While we believe that Honeywell has complied with all relevant U.S. laws and regulations regarding the manufacture of these sensors, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the investigation or what action, if any, may result from it. Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations (including the specific matters referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above). Considering our past experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. Warranties and Guarantees In the normal course of business we issue product warranties and product performance guarantees.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. Pension benefits for substantially all U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywells U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. Less than 1% of Honeywells U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company; and this subsidy is limited to a fixed-dollar amount. In addition, more than 80% of Honeywells current retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

To determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments. We use the single weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) During the fourth quarter of 2015 we changed the methodology used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit (income) cost for our significant pension plans. Previously, we estimated such cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the pension benefit obligation. The new methodology utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these cost components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. The change does not affect the measurement of our pension obligation and is applied prospectively as a change in estimate. For our U.S. pension plans, the single weighted-average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2016 are 4.69% and 3.59%. We estimate the service and interest costs for our U.S. pension plans will be reduced by approximately $150 million in 2016. Our expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 7.75% is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations. We review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. For non-U.S. benefit plans actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country. The impact of the discount rate methodology change on service and interest costs for our non-U.S. pension plans was not material. Pension Benefits Included in the aggregate data in the tables above are the amounts applicable to our pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets. Amounts related to such plans were as follows: ##TABLE_START            December 31,  U.S. Plans  Non-U.S. Plans  2015  2014  2015  2014 Projected benefit obligation  $  17,298   $    $  1,624   $  1,686  Accumulated benefit obligation  $  16,899   $    $  1,574   $  1,584  Fair value of plan assets  $  16,349   $    $    $   ##TABLE_END Accumulated benefit obligation for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $16.9 billion and $17.2 billion and for our Non-U.S. defined benefit plans were $6.2 billion and $5.5 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014. Our asset investment strategy for our U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve our long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. Our actual invested positions in various securities change over time based on short and longer- term investment opportunities. To achieve our objectives, we have established long-term target allocations as follows: 60%-70% equity securities, 10%-20% fixed income securities and cash, 5%-15% real estate investments, and 10%-20% other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located both inside and outside the United States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies. We review our assets on a regular basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations.

Sufficient cash or cash equivalents are held by our pension plans to cover the notional value of the futures contracts. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, our U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $2,613 million and $2,354 million. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, our non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $54 million and $65 million. In both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is primarily related to outstanding equity futures contracts. Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgages, asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in commingled funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals. Our general funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made. We are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2016. In 2015, contributions of $139 million were made to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. In 2016, we expect to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $160 million to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Contributions for both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at the Elster Division of Melrose Industries Plc. (Elster), which was acquired on December 29, 2015 and whose financial statements constitute approximately 1.8% of consolidated total assets and a de minimis percentage of total consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Elster. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, including in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP Parsippany, New Jersey February 12, 2016 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm T O T HE B OARD OF D IRECTORS AND S HAREHOLDERS OF H ONEYWELL I NTERNATIONAL I NC .: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of two years in the period ended December 31, 2014 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Honeywell International Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey February 13, 2015 ", "9A": " Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Honeywell management maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There have been no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Honeywells internal control over financial reporting that have occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2015. Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) at December 31, 2015. Based on these evaluations, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 were effective as of December 31, 2015. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Honeywell management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Honeywells internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management assessed the effectiveness of Honeywells internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) . Management excluded the Elster Division of Melrose Industries plc (Elster), acquired on December 29, 2015, from its evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 Elster represented approximately 1.8% of our consolidated total assets and a de minimus percentage of our total consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Based on this assessment, management determined that Honeywell maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. The effectiveness of Honeywells internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by Deloitte  Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. ", "9B": " Item 9B. Other Information Under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syrian Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Honeywell is required to disclose in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with entities or individuals designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. A non-U.S. wholly-owned subsidiary of Honeywell (the Non-U.S. Subsidiary) inadvertently made four ground shipments of low value, non-U.S. items from Turkey to Uzbekistan from December 2013 to March 2014 that transited through Iran en route to Uzbekistan on trucks operated by a third party transportation vendor (the Vendor) retained by the Non-U.S. Subsidiary. The Non-U.S. Subsidiary hired the Vendor to facilitate shipment and the Vendor further engaged a trucking company to provide surface transport. The Vendor proposed the transport route for the shipment. The shipment of the items via Iran occurred inadvertently as a result of non-U.S. person employees approving the transport route proposed by the Vendor. Honeywell disclosed these past transactions voluntarily to the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The Non-U.S. Subsidiary did not pay, directly or indirectly, any duties or taxes to the Government of Iran as a result of these shipments because the shipments were made under TIR (Transports Internationaux Routiers) Carnets, a treaty system which allows for the transport of merchandise through contracting parties from the customs office of departure to the customs office of destination without payment of customs duties/taxes in transiting countries. Further, the Non-U.S. Subsidiary made all payments for shipping services to the Vendor on a flat-fee basis at a rate of $11,800 per shipment, and the Non- U.S. Subsidiary did not reimburse the Vendor for any fees or other expenses incurred in Iran. Neither Honeywell nor the Non-U.S. Subsidiary derived any revenue by inadvertently shipping the items via Iran. ", "10": " Item 10.

Brand identity, service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of OEMs. Aerospace Sales Our Aerospace segment sales were 38%, 39% and 39% of our total sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Our sales to commercial aerospace OEMs were 6%, 8% and 6% of our total sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014. In addition, our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 12%, 12% and 11% of our total sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014.U.S. Government Sales Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by Aerospace), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $3,330 million, $3,743 million and $3,693 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a prime contractor and subcontractor, of $2,647 million, $2,680 million and $2,792 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014. U.S. defense##TABLE_START 4 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDspending decreased in 2016 compared to 2015. We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2017 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEMs production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs), as well as our diversified commercial businesses.Backlog Our total backlog at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $19,075 million and $18,183 million. We anticipate that approximately $12,022 million of the 2016 backlog will be filled in 2017. We believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option.International Operations We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development (RD) globally. U.S. exports and non-U.S. manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 13% of our total sales in 2016 and 14% in each of 2015 and 2014. Non-U.S. manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 43% of our total sales in 2016, 39% in 2015 and 41% in 2014.##TABLE_START   Year Ended December 31, 2016    Manufactured Products and Systems and Performance of Services  Aerospace  Home and Building Technologies  Performance Materials and Technologies  Safety and Productivity Solutions   (% of Total Sales)  U.S. Exports   21 %   2 %   18 %   5 % Non-U.S.   33 %   50 %   48 %   46 % ##TABLE_END Information related to risks attendant to our foreign operations is included in Item 1A. Risk Factors under the caption Macroeconomic and Industry Risks.Raw Materials The principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available. Although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply, we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2016. We are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials.The costs of certain key raw materials, including R240, fluorspar, copper, ethylene and perchloroethylene in Performance Materials and Technologies and nickel, steel, titanium and other metals in Aerospace, are expected to continue to fluctuate. We will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2017.Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business.Research and Development The Companys principal research and development activities are in the U.S., India, Europe and China. Research and development expense totaled $2,143 million, $1,856 million and $1,892 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014. RD expense was 5% of sales in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014. Customer-sponsored (principally by the U.S. Government) RD activities amounted to an additional $967 million, $998 million and $1,034 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014.##TABLE_START 5 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDEnvironment We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is also possible that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances.Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys National Priority List. Although there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we do not anticipate having to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole.We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Companys business or markets that it serves, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures, earnings, competitive position or financial standing. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.Employees We have approximately 131,000 employees at December 31, 2016, of whom approximately 45,000 are located in the United States.##TABLE_START 6 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDExecutive Officers of the Registrant The executive officers of Honeywell, listed as follows, are elected annually by the Board of Directors.

Risk Factors Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements We describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in other parts of this report (including this Item 1A). Such discussions contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.Risk Factors Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.Macroeconomic and Industry Risks Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations. ##TABLE_START  Aerospace Operating results of Aerospace are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, as well as changes in customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions and capacity constraints. The operating results of our Commercial Aviation business unit may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and global flying hours, which impact air transport, regional, business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain. Operating results in our Transportation Systems business unit may be affected by the level of production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products and delays in launch schedules for new automobile and truck platforms. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Home and Building Technologies Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global residential and commercial construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects, less industrial plant expansion, changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Performance Materials and Technologies Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply volatility, product commoditization, and our ability to maximize our facilities production capacity and minimize downtime. In particular, the volatility in oil and natural gas prices have and will continue to impact our customers operating levels and capital spending and thus demand for our products and services. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 8 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Safety and Productivity Solutions Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global capital spending and operating expenditures, including in the oil and gas industry, reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives, fluctuations in retail markets, lower customer demand due to the failure to anticipate and respond to overall trends related to end market demand, changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and technology that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices and lower margins. ##TABLE_END An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations. Our international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Companys sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes), violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate these risks), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, including the United Kingdom referendum in favor of exiting the European Union and the evolving U.S. political, regulatory and economic landscape following the 2016 elections, and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.Operating outside of the United States also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss.Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations.Operational Risks Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities. The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in Performance Materials and Technologies (R240, fluorspar, copper, ethylene and perchloroethylene) and in Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.Many major components, product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers inability to scale##TABLE_START 9 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDproduction and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, and during integration we may discover cybersecurity and compliance issues. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification.Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins. Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors including many new and non-traditional competitors, (iv) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (v) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (vi) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products.The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses. Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, attrition, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations.As a supplier to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unique risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future.We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government##TABLE_START 10 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDprocurement regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended.Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third party service providers including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.Legal and Regulatory Risks Our U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments##TABLE_START 11 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDof future earnings of the Company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the guidelines provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to address base erosion and profit shifting, and potential comprehensive U.S. tax reform which, among other things, might change certain U.S. tax rules impacting the way U.S based multinationals are taxed, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income taxes.Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety, performance and product certification regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial Aftermarket may be impacted by, among other things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations, while emissions, fuel economy and energy efficiency standards for motor vehicles can impact Transportation Systems. Within Home and Building Technologies, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies results of operations can be affected by environmental, safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive.We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, import and export, and environmental, health and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_END (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Honeywell International Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (Honeywell or the Company) for the three years ended December 31, 2016. All references to Notes relate to Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.In July 2016, the Company announced the realignment of the business units comprising its Automation and Control Solutions reporting segment by forming two new reportable operating segments: Home and Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions. Home and Building Technologies includes Environmental  Energy Solutions, Security and Fire, and Building Solutions and Distribution. Additionally, the Industrial Combustion/Thermal business, previously part of Environmental  Energy Solutions in Automation and Control Solutions, became part of Performance Materials and Technologies. Safety and Productivity Solutions includes Sensing  Productivity Solutions and Industrial Safety, as well as the Intelligrated business. Under the realigned segment reporting structure, the Company has four reportable operating segments: Aerospace, Home and Building Technologies, Performance Materials and Technologies, and Safety and Productivity Solutions. The Company has reported its financial performance based on this realignment for all periods presented. These realignments have no impact on the Companys historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period segment presentation. On September 16, 2016, the Company completed the sale of the Aerospace government services business, Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. The assets and liabilities associated with Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. have been removed from the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the effective date of the sale. The results of operations for Honeywell Technology Solutions are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations through the effective date of the sale. On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off of its Resins and Chemicals business, part of Performance Materials and Technologies, into a standalone, publicly-traded company (named AdvanSix) to Honeywell shareowners. The assets and liabilities associated with AdvanSix have been removed from the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the effective date of the spin-off. The results of operations for AdvanSix are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations through the effective date of the spin-off.Executive summary In 2016, Honeywell successfully navigated a challenging macro-economic environment. We grew net sales 2% to $39,302 million, grew earnings per share of common stock  assuming dilution 3% to $6.20 and grew net income attributable to Honeywell 1% to $4,809 million. We executed on cost reduction activities, accelerated our capital deployment strategy and improved the growth portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures, including the divestiture of Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. and the tax-free spin-off of AdvanSix. We also announced the realignment of the business units comprising our Automation and Control Solutions segment to two new reportable operating segments, as previously mentioned. The Company also announced a leadership succession plan for our Chief Executive Officer and successfully executed leadership transitions in three of our four reportable operating segments.We continued our balanced long-term focus on enhancing shareowner value without sacrificing growth investment, including maintaining RD spending at 5% of sales, new product introductions aligned with global macroeconomic trends in energy, safety, security, productivity and global urbanization, over $300 million of new repositioning investments to improve our operations and increased investment in High Growth Regions. We also continued to enhance our software capabilities through the creation of a software center in the United States to staff more than 730 full-time product software engineers, who are in addition to the more than 11,000 software engineers already part of Honeywell.##TABLE_START 16 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDIn 2016 we deployed capital of over $7.5 billion, including the following:##TABLE_START  Mergers and Acquisitions we deployed over $2.5 billion during 2016, acquiring businesses that will be integrated into each of our four operating segments. These acquisitions all share a software and technology focus and increase our existing deep alignment with enduring macro trends such as energy efficiency, clean energy generation, safety, security, productivity and global urbanization.     Dividend after a 15% dividend rate increase in 2015, we increased our annual dividend rate by 12% in 2016, as we seek to continue to grow the dividend faster than earnings, marking the 12 th dividend increase in the past 11 years.     Share Repurchases we continue to opportunistically repurchase our shares with the goal of generally keeping share count flat and seeking to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation and savings plans. In 2016, we repurchased 19.3 million shares for $2.1 billion.     Capital Investment in Facilities we invested over $1 billion in capital expenditures focused on high return investments such as the expansion of facilities to manufacture our Solstice low global-warming potential refrigerant products and building new production facilities to make UOP catalyst and absorbent products. ##TABLE_END Honeywell also completed refinancing of long-term debt through the issuance of 4,000 million Senior Notes in February and an additional $4,500 million Senior Notes in October. The proceeds from the offerings of Senior Notes were used to repurchase $2,200 million of Senior Notes outstanding, as well as repay outstanding commercial paper. We expect these refinancing activities will reduce our ongoing annual interest expense.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales ##TABLE_START   2016  2015  2014              Net sales  $ 39,302   $ 38,581   $ 40,306  % change compared with prior period   2 %   (4 )%     ##TABLE_END The change in net sales is attributable to the following:##TABLE_START   2016 Versus 2015  2015 Versus 2014      Volume   (2 )%   1 % Price   -

The effective tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to unusual or infrequently occurring items, the resolution of income tax audits, changes in tax laws or other items such as pension mark-to-market adjustments and the tax impact from employee share-based payments.Net Income Attributable to Honeywell ##TABLE_START   2016  2015  2014           Net income attributable to Honeywell  $ 4,809   $ 4,768   $ 4,239               Earnings per share of common stock  assuming dilution  $ 6.20   $ 6.04   $ 5.33  ##TABLE_END Earnings per share of common stock  assuming dilution increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily driven by increased pension and other postretirement income, higher segment profit in Home and Building Technologies and Performance Materials and Technologies, the gain related to the Honeywell Technology Solutions, Inc. divestiture, a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding and the tax benefit from adoption of the FASBs accounting standard related to employee share-based payment accounting, partially offset by lower segment profit in Aerospace and Safety and Productivity Solutions, increased pension mark-to-market expense and higher repositioning and other charges.Earnings per share of common stock  assuming dilution increased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily driven by increased segment profit in each of our business segments and lower pension and other postretirement expense, partially offset by increased tax expense and lower other income (principally due to the absence of a realized gain related to the prior year sale of marketable equity securities).BUSINESS OVERVIEW ##TABLE_START  Our consolidated results are principally impacted by:     Change in global economic growth rates and industry conditions and demand in our key end markets;      Ability of recently acquired businesses to integrate and continue to operate and grow in accordance with the assumptions utilized in determining the acquisition purchase price;      The impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (in particular the Euro), relative to the U.S. Dollar;      The extent to which cost savings from productivity actions are able to offset or exceed the impact of material and non-material inflation; and      The impact of the pension discount rate and asset returns on pension expense, including mark-to-market adjustments, and funding requirements.     Our 2017 areas of focus which are generally applicable to each of our operating segments include:     Ensuring the successful completion of the leadership transition, which includes the Chief Executive Officer and leaders for three of our operating segments, and continuing to execute on the realignment of our Home and Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions operating segments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 19 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   Driving profitable organic growth through RD and technological excellence to deliver innovative products that customers value and expansion and localization of our footprint in high growth regions;      Executing on our strategy to become a software-industrial company, which for us means products and services that facilitate the connected plane, home, building and factory;      Executing disciplined, rigorous MA and integration processes to deliver growth through previously announced acquisitions;      Expanding margins by maintaining and improving the Companys cost structure through manufacturing and administrative process improvements, repositioning, and other productivity actions;      Controlling corporate and other non-operating costs, including costs incurred for asbestos and environmental matters, pension and other post-retirement and income tax expense;      Increasing availability of capital through strong cash flow conversion from effective working capital management and proactively managing debt levels to enable the Company to smartly deploy capital for strategic acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases and capital expenditures. ##TABLE_END Review of Business Segments ##TABLE_START            % Change            2016  2015   Years Ended December 31,   Versus  Versus   2016  2015  2014  2015  2014 Aerospace Sales                     Commercial Aviation Original Equipment  $ 2,525   $ 2,905   $ 2,607    (13 )%   11 % Commercial Aviation Aftermarket   4,796    4,656    4,578    3 %   2 % Defense and Space   4,375    4,715    4,754    (7 )%   (1 )% Transportation Systems   3,055    2,961    3,659    3 %   (19 )% Total Aerospace Sales   14,751    15,237    15,598                               Home and Building Technologies Sales                     Home and Building Products   5,967    4,711    4,868    27 %   (3 )% Home and Building Distribution   4,687    4,450    4,617    5 %   (4 )% Total Home and Building Technologies Sales   10,654    9,161    9,485                               Performance Materials and Technologies Sales                     UOP   2,469    2,976    3,195    (17 )%   (7 )% Process Solutions   3,476    2,989    3,378    16 %   (12 )% Advanced Materials   3,327    3,510    3,904    (5 )%   (10 )% Total Performance Materials and                     Technologies Sales   9,272    9,475    10,477                               Safety and Productivity Solutions Sales                     Safety   2,075    2,135    2,339    (3 )%   (9 )% Productivity Solutions   2,550    2,573    2,407    (1 )%   7 % Total Safety and Productivity Solutions Sales   4,625    4,708    4,746          Net Sales  $ 39,302   $ 38,581   $ 40,306          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 20 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDAerospace ##TABLE_START   2016  2015  Change  2014  Change                 Net sales  $ 14,751   $ 15,237    (3 )%  $ 15,598    (2 )% Cost of products and services sold   10,820    11,068        11,699      Selling, general and administrative expenses   620    643        712      Other   320    308        272      Segment profit  $ 2,991   $ 3,218    (7 )%  $ 2,915    10 % ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   2016 vs. 2015  2015 vs. 2014 Factors Contributing to Year-Over-Year Change  Sales  Segment Profit  Sales  Segment Profit              Organic growth/ Operational segment profit   (3 )%   (6 )%   2 %   8 % Foreign currency translation   -    (1 )%   (3 )%   (4 )% Acquisitions, divestitures and other, net   -    -    (1 )%   6 % Total % Change   (3 )%   (7 )%   (2 )%   10 % ##TABLE_END 2016 compared with 2015 Aerospace sales decreased primarily due to higher incentives to original equipment manufacturers (OEM Incentives), a decrease in organic sales volumes and the Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. divestiture, which was partially offset by growth from acquisitions.##TABLE_START   Commercial Original Equipment sales decreased by 13% (decreased 12% organic) primarily due to higher OEM incentives and decreased demand from business and general aviation original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), partially offset by higher shipments to air transport OEMs. Consistent with broader aerospace industry trends, we expect the continuation of lower business and general aviation OEM sales volumes.      Commercial Aftermarket sales increased by 3% (increased 3% organic) primarily driven by higher repair and overhaul activities and increased spares shipments.      Defense and Space sales decreased by 7% (decreased 6% organic) primarily due to declines in U.S. space and international defense programs, lower U.S. government services revenue, largely attributable to the impact of divestitures, and decreased demand from commercial helicopter OEMs, partially offset by sales from acquisitions.      Transportation Systems sales increased by 3% (increased 4% organic) primarily driven by new platform launches and higher global turbo gas penetration. ##TABLE_END Aerospace segment profit decreased primarily due to a 6% decrease in operational segment profit and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The decrease in operational segment profit is primarily due to product mix, higher OEM incentives and lower sales volumes, partially offset by productivity and price, net of inflation. Cost of products and services sold decreased primarily driven by productivity, net of inflation, and lower sales volumes, partially offset by acquisitions, net of divestitures.2015 compared with 2014 Aerospace sales decreased primarily due to the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and the Friction Materials divestiture, partially offset by an increase in organic sales, as discussed below, and a decrease in OEM incentives predominantly to air transport and regional aviation OEMs.##TABLE_START   Commercial Original Equipment sales increased by 11% (increased by 5% organic) primarily driven by a decrease in OEM Incentives and higher business and general aviation engine shipments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 21 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   Commercial Aftermarket sales increased by 2% (increased 2% organic) primarily driven by higher repair and overhaul activities, partially offset by lower retrofits, modifications and upgrades for business and general aviation customers.

These repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of $200 million to $300 million in 2017 compared with 2016 principally from planned workforce reductions. Cash spending related to our repositioning actions was $228 million, $118 million and $161 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, and was funded through operating cash flows. In 2017, we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately $225 million and to be funded through operating cash flows.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. We continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends.Cash Flow Summary Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows:##TABLE_START 25 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   Years Ended December 31,   2016  2015  2014 Cash provided by (used for):             Operating activities  $ 5,498   $ 5,519   $ 5,080  Investing activities   (3,342 )   (6,514 )   (1,876 ) Financing activities   346    37    (2,328 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash   (114 )   (546 )   (339 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents  $ 2,388   $ (1,504 )  $ 537  ##TABLE_END 2016 compared with 2015 Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $21 million primarily due to a $958 million unfavorable impact from working capital, partially offset by (i) a $395 million improvement in customer advances and deferred income, (ii) a $171 million increase in net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, (iii) the absence of $151 million in OEM incentive payments and (iv) lower cash tax payments of $50 million.Cash used for investing activities decreased by $3,172 million primarily due to (i) a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $2,655 million, most significantly Elster in 2015, (ii) an increase in proceeds from the sales of businesses of $295 million (most significantly Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc.) and (iii) a $384 million favorable change in settlements of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The decreases were partially offset by a net $146 million increase in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities.Cash provided by financing activities increased by $309 million primarily due to an increase in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $497 million, partially offset by an increase in cash dividends paid of $189 million including amounts paid to the former UOP Russell LLC noncontrolling shareholder.2015 compared with 2014 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $439 million primarily due to a $489 million favorable impact from working capital and a $382 million increase in net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, partially offset by (i) a $175 million decrease in customer advances and deferred income, (ii) $151 million in OEM incentives and (iii) increased cash tax payments of $50 million.Cash used for investing activities increased by $4,638 million primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $5,224 million, most significantly Elster, and a decrease in proceeds of $159 million, primarily from the Friction Materials divestiture, partially offset by a net $659 million decrease in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities.Cash provided by financing activities increased by $2,365 million primarily due to an increase in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $3,648 million, partially offset by an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $1,039 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of $216 million.Liquidity Each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. Considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies, including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity. In addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. At December 31, 2016, a substantial portion of the Companys cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. If the amounts held outside of the U.S. were to be repatriated, under current law, they would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest the vast majority of these funds outside of the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability.##TABLE_START 26 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDWe monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.A source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings and commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2016 was (0.13%) and as of December 31, 2015 was 0.26%. Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2016, Standard and Poors (SP), Fitch, and Moodys have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1. SP, Fitch and Moodys have Honeywells rating outlook as stable. To date, the Company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity.We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions.See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 12 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements of Notes to Financial Statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity.In 2016, the Company repurchased $2,079 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. In April 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $5 billion of Honeywell common stock, of which $4.1 billion remained available as of December 31, 2016 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans.In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, dividends, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments.Specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2017 to be as follows:##TABLE_START  Capital expenditureswe expect to spend approximately $1.1 billion for capital expenditures in 2017 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Share repurchases under the Companys share repurchase program, $4.1 billion is available as of December 31, 2016 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Dividendswe increased our quarterly dividend rate by 12% to $.6650 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2016 dividend. The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2017. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Asbestos claimswe expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $546 million and $23 million in 2017. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Pension contributionsin 2017, we are not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans. We plan to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $130 million ($89 million of marketable securities were contributed in January 2017) to our non-U.S. plans to ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 27 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDsatisfy regulatory funding standards. The timing and amount of contributions to both our U.S. and non-U.S. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans.##TABLE_START  Repositioning actionswe expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute repositioning actions will approximate $225 million in 2017. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Environmental remediation costswe expect to spend approximately $250 million in 2017 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs. ##TABLE_END We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2016 and 2015, we realized $565 million and $1 million in cash proceeds from sales and a spin-off of non-strategic businesses.Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines and access to the public debt and equity markets, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities.Contractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments Following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2016:##TABLE_START      Payments by Period      Total(6)  2017  2018- 2019  2020- 2021  Thereafter Long-term debt, including capitalized leases (1)  $ 12,409   $ 227   $ 2,672   $ 3,611   $ 5,899  Interest payments on long-term debt, including capitalized leases   3,491    290    568    495    2,138  Minimum operating lease payments   1,123    289    374    204    256  Purchase obligations (2)   1,657    778    499    293    87  Estimated environmental liability payments (3)   511    252    191    62    6  Asbestos related liability payments (4)   1,560    546    699    295    20  Asbestos insurance recoveries (5)   (440 )   (23 )   (110 )   (103 )   (204 )   $ 20,311   $ 2,359   $ 4,893   $ 4,857   $ 8,202  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity.

See Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Financial Statements for additional information. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 28 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDEnvironmental Matters Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $195 million, $194 million and $268 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014. In addition, in 2016 and 2015 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $83 million and $90 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations.Spending related to known environmental matters was $228 million, $273 million and $321 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014 and is estimated to be approximately $250 million in 2017. We expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties.See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of our environmental matters.Financial Instruments The following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at December 31, 2016 and 2015.##TABLE_START   Face or Notional Amount  Carrying Value (1)  Fair Value (1)  Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value (2) December 31, 2016                 Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments                 Long-term debt (including current maturities)  $ 12,409   $ (12,409 )  $ (13,008 )  $ (537 ) Interest rate swap agreements   1,850    21    21    (112 ) Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments                 Foreign currency exchange contracts (3)   9,554    150    150    (195 )                  December 31, 2015                 Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments                 Long-term debt (including current maturities)  $ 6,131   $ (6,131 )  $ (6,721 )  $ (407 ) Interest rate swap agreements   1,100    92    92    (59 ) Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments                 Foreign currency exchange contracts (3)   10,538    11    11    (153 ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Asset or (liability).

(3) Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions. ##TABLE_END See Note 14 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion on the agreements.##TABLE_START 29 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.Contingent Liabilities We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, legal and environmental, health and safety matters. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies.Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries Honeywells involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust. The estimate of future NARCO claims is based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts and also reflects disputes concerning implementation of the Trust Distribution Procedures by the NARCO Trust, a lack of sufficient trust claims processing experience, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims which remained in place throughout NARCOs Chapter 11 case. Some critical assumptions underlying this commonly accepted methodology include claims filing rates, disease criteria and payment values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures, estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances. The estimated value of future NARCO claims was originally established at the time of the NARCO Chapter 11 filing reflecting claims expected to be asserted against NARCO over a fifteen year period. This projection resulted in a range of estimated liability of $743 million to $961 million. We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years.In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries.##TABLE_START 30 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDSee Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries.Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. Annual pension (income) expense is comprised of a potential mark-to-market adjustment (MTM Adjustment) and service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets and prior service amortization (Pension Ongoing (Income) Expense).The key assumptions used in developing our 2016, 2015 and 2014 net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following:##TABLE_START   2016  2015  2014 Discount Rate:             Projected benefit obligation   4.46 %   4.08 %   4.89 % Service cost (1)   4.69 %   N/A    N/A  Interest cost (1)   3.59 %   N/A    N/A  Assets:             Expected rate of return   7.75 %   7.75 %   7.75 % Actual rate of return   10 %   2 %   8 % Actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return   6 %   7 %   8 % ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) N/A in 2015 and 2014 as the discount rate methodology was changed in fourth quarter of 2015. See Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END The MTM Adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor. Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM charges were $273 million, $67 million and $249 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014.We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). We plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% for 2017 as this is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and the asset mix of the plans investments.The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We used a 4.20% discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of December 31, 2016, reflecting the decrease in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end.In addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment:##TABLE_START 31 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   Impact on 2017     Pension   Change in Assumption  Ongoing Expense  Impact on PBO 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate  Decrease $20 million  Increase $500 million 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate  Increase $18 million  Decrease $460 million 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets  Increase $40 million   0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets  Decrease $40 million   ##TABLE_END Pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately $715 million in 2017 compared with pension ongoing income of $601 million in 2016. The expected increase is primarily due to higher asset returns in 2016 and lower interest costs due to a decline in discount rates, mainly in our U.S. and UK plans. Also, if required, an MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2017, and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets.Long-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets) The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows:##TABLE_START   Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations;      Annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line;      Significant negative industry or economic trends; or      Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. ##TABLE_END Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry growth rates, sales volume, selling prices and costs, and the discount rate selected. These estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility. Management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing  Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing. In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions.Income Taxes On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections##TABLE_START 32 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDof future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. Our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences.Sales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts In 2016, we recognized approximately 13% of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts. These long-term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.OTHER MATTERS Litigation See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation matters.Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.", "7A": " Item 7A.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting Principles The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is a description of Honeywells significant accounting policies.Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. Our consolidation policy requires equity investments that we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investees activities to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.Redeemable noncontrolling interest is considered to be temporary equity and is therefore reported outside of permanent equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the greater of the initial carrying amount adjusted for the noncontrolling interests share of net income (loss) or its redemption value.Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding assets useful life.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2016 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date.Other Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years.Sales Recognition Product and service sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts are recorded on a percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident. Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis. Amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services.Environmental We accrue costs related to environmental matters when it is probable that we have incurred a liability related to a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies.Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies.Aerospace Sales Incentives We provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of our aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and braking system hardware, avionics, and auxiliary power units, for installation on commercial aircraft. These incentives consist of##TABLE_START 39 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) free or deeply discounted products, credits for future purchases of product and upfront cash payments. These costs are recognized in the period incurred as cost of products sold or as a reduction to sales, as appropriate.Research and Development Research and development costs for company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred. Such costs are principally included in cost of products sold and were $2,143 million, $1,856 million and $1,892 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014.Stock-Based Compensation Plans The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 18 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units. The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and are based on our historical forfeiture rates.Pension Benefits  We recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment), and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered. The remaining components of pension (income) expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recognized on a quarterly basis (Pension ongoing (income) expense). Foreign Currency Translation  Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. Dollars are translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings.Derivative Financial Instruments  We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item.Income Taxes  Significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known.##TABLE_START 40 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Cash and cash equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less.Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding.Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.Recent Accounting Pronouncements We consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows (consolidated financial statements).In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of time value of money in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers. The effective date was deferred for one year to the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date  interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016. The guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method.We are still finalizing the analysis to quantify the adoption impact of the provisions of the new standard, but we do not currently expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Based on the evaluation of our current contracts and revenue streams, most will be recorded consistently under both the current and new standard. The FASB has issued, and may issue in the future, interpretive guidance which may cause our evaluation to change. We believe we are following an appropriate timeline to allow for proper recognition, presentation and disclosure upon adoption effective the beginning of fiscal year 2018.In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases that will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance requires the use of a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and related notes to financial statements.In March 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance related to the employee share-based payment accounting. The guidance requires all income tax effect of awards to be recognized in the income statement, which were previously presented as a component of Total shareowners equity, on a prospective basis. The guidance also requires presentation of excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity. We have elected to early adopt the standard in the quarter ended September 30, 2016, which requires adoption effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year. The adoption resulted in a diluted earnings per share benefit of $0.14 and the recognition of excess tax benefits as a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $127 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Refer to Note 24 Unaudited Quarterly Financial Information for the earnings per share for the first and second quarters of 2016, recast to reflect the impact from adoption. Cash paid by the Company when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes are classified as a financing activity on a retrospective basis.##TABLE_START 41 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The guidance allows for an accounting policy election to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. We elected to maintain the current forfeitures policy and will continue to include an estimate of those forfeitures when recognizing stock compensation expense. Classification of the excess tax benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are presented on a prospective basis as of January 1, 2016.In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and payments are classified in the statement of cash flows, including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, the settlement of contingent liabilities arising from a business combination, proceeds from insurance settlements, and distributions from certain equity method investees. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The guidance requires application on a retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance.In October 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Under current GAAP, recognition of the income tax consequences for asset transfers other than inventory could not be recognized until the asset was sold to a third party. The guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice related to the tax consequences of certain types of intra-entity asset transfers, particularly those involving intellectual property. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The guidance requires application on a modified retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.Note 2. Acquisitions and Divestitures During 2016 and 2015, we acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash and debt assumed) of $2,538 million and $5,244 million.In August 2016, the Company acquired Intelligrated, a leading provider of supply chain and warehouse automation technologies, for an aggregate value, net of cash acquired, of $1,488 million. Intelligrated is part of Safety and Productivity Solutions. The preliminary determination of the assets and liabilities acquired with Intelligrated have been included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016, including $1,129 million allocated to goodwill, which is non-deductible for tax purposes.In April 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Xtralis International Holdings Limited (Xtralis), a leading global provider of aspiration smoke detection and perimeter security technologies, for an aggregate cost, net of cash acquired and debt assumed, of $515 million. Xtralis is part of Home and Building Technologies.In February 2016, the Company acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of COM DEV International (COM DEV), a leading satellite and space components provider, for an aggregate value, net of cash acquired and debt assumed, of $347 million. COM DEV is part of Aerospace and had reported 2015 fiscal year revenues of $159 million.I n January 2016, the Company acquired the remaining 30 percent noncontrolling interest in UOP Russell LLC, which develops technology and manufactures modular equipment to process natural gas, for $240 million. UOP Russell LLC is part of Performance Materials and Technologies. In December 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the Elster Division of Melrose Industries plc (Elster), for an aggregate value, net of cash acquired, of $4,899 million.

Goodwill arising from these acquisitions is non-deductible for tax purposes. The results of operations from date of acquisition through December 31, 2016 are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off of its Resins and Chemicals business, part of Performance Materials and Technologies, into a standalone, publicly-traded company (named AdvanSix Inc. or AdvanSix) to Honeywell shareowners. The assets and liabilities associated with AdvanSix have been removed from the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. The results of operations for AdvanSix are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations through the effective date of the spin-off.Honeywell shareowners of record as of the close of business on September 16, 2016 received one share of AdvanSix common stock for every 25 shares of Honeywell common stock. Immediately prior to the effective date of the spin-off, AdvanSix incurred debt to make a cash distribution of $269 million to the Company. At the same time, AdvanSix also incurred $38 million of borrowings in order to fund its post spin-off working capital.The Company entered into certain agreements with AdvanSix to effect our legal and structural separation including a transition services agreement with AdvanSix to provide certain administrative and other services for a limited time.On September 16, 2016, the Company completed the sale of Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. for a sale price of $300 million. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $176 million, which was recorded in Other (income) expense. The Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. business was part of Aerospace.##TABLE_START 43 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives; the separation of the former Automation and Control Solutions reporting segment into two new reporting segments; factory transitions in each of our reportable operating segments to more cost-effective locations; and achieving acquisition-related synergies. The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $43 million principally related to the write-off of certain intangible assets in connection with the sale of a Performance Materials and Technologies business. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $43 million principally for expenses related to the spin-off of our AdvanSix business and closure obligations associated with factory transitions. Also, $109 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned to income as a result of higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments, lower than expected severance costs in certain repositioning actions, and changes in scope of previously announced repositioning actions.##TABLE_START 44 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) In 2015, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $216 million including severance costs of $197 million related to workforce reductions of 6,405 manufacturing and administrative positions across our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. Also, $53 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned to income due principally to higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments, and changes in scope of previously announced repositioning actions.In 2014, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $184 million including severance costs of $156 million related to workforce reductions of 2,975 manufacturing and administrative positions across our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives; factory transitions in Home and Building Technologies, Safety and Productivity Solutions and Aerospace to more cost-effective locations; and site consolidations and organizational realignments of businesses in Home and Building Technologies, Safety and Productivity Solutions and Performance Materials and Technologies. Also, $38 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned to income due principally to the change in scope of a previously announced repositioning action and higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments.The following table summarizes the status of our total repositioning reserves:##TABLE_START   Severance  Asset  Exit     Costs  Impairments  Costs  Total Balance at December 31, 2013  $ 302   $ -   $ 45   $ 347  2014 charges   156    12    16    184  2014 usage - cash   (135 )   -    (26 )   (161 ) 2014 usage - noncash   -    (12 )   -    (12 ) Adjustments   (33 )   -    (5 )   (38 ) Foreign currency translation   (5 )   -    -    (5 ) Balance at December 31, 2014   285    -    30    315  2015 charges   197    13    6    216  2015 usage - cash   (109 )   -    (9 )   (118 ) 2015 usage - noncash   -    (13 )   -    (13 ) Acquisitions   16    -    -    16  Adjustments   (49 )   -    (4 )   (53 ) Foreign currency translation   (11 )   -    (2 )   (13 ) Balance at December 31, 2015   329    -    21    350  2016 charges   283    43    43    369  2016 usage - cash   (203 )   -    (25 )   (228 ) 2016 usage - noncash   (6 )   (43 )   -    (49 ) Adjustments   (106 )   -    (3 )   (109 ) Foreign currency translation   1    -    (3 )   (2 ) Balance at December 31, 2016  $ 298   $ -   $ 33   $ 331  ##TABLE_END Certain repositioning projects in each of our reportable operating segments in 2016, 2015 and 2014 included exit or disposal activities, the costs related to which will be recognized in future periods when the actual liability is incurred.

The decrease was primarily attributable to excess tax benefits from employee share-based payments arising from adoption of the FASBs amended guidance related to employee share-based payment accounting, partially offset by increased tax reserves in various jurisdictions and lower tax benefits from manufacturing incentives. The Companys non-U.S. effective tax rate was 16.7%, a decrease of approximately 2.8 percentage points compared to 2015. The year-over-year decrease in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily driven by higher earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and a decrease in the tax impact of restructuring and divestitures. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to overall non-U.S. earnings taxed at lower rates.The effective tax rate increased by 0.8 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to decreased tax benefits from the resolution of tax audits, partially offset by increased tax benefits from manufacturing incentives, the impact of more income in jurisdictions with lower tax rates and fewer reserves. The Companys non-U.S. effective tax rate for 2015 was 19.5%, a decrease of approximately 1.8 percentage points compared to 2014. The year-over-year decrease in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily attributable to higher earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions coupled with lower expense related to reserves in various jurisdictions, partially offset by an increase from the tax impact of restructuring and dispositions. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to overall non-U.S. earnings taxed at lower rates.Deferred tax assets (liabilities) The tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which give rise to future income tax benefits and payables are as follows:##TABLE_START 47 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Our gross deferred tax assets include $1,034 million related to non-U.S. operations comprised principally of net operating losses, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards (mainly in Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom) and deductible temporary differences. We maintain a valuation allowance of $619 million against a portion of the non-U.S. gross deferred tax assets. The change in the valuation allowance resulted in an increase of $69 million, increase of $114 million and decrease of $10 million to income tax expense in 2016, 2015 and 2014. In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a reduction to income tax expense in the period that such determination is made.As of December 31, 2016, our net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards were as follows:##TABLE_START Jurisdiction  Expiration Period  Net Operating and Capital Loss Carryforwards  Tax Credit Carryforwards U.S. Federal  2036  $ 25   $ 55  U.S. State  2036   720    26  Non-U.S.  2035   651    137  Non-U.S.  Indefinite   2,186    -      $ 3,582   $ 218  ##TABLE_END Many jurisdictions impose limitations on the timing and utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.

Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Credit and Market Risk Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities.We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers.Foreign Currency Risk Management We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. Our primary objective is to preserve the U.S. Dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows and earnings. We attempt to hedge currency exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts (foreign currency exchange contracts) with third parties.We hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in other (income) expense. We partially hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which occur in the next twelve months and are denominated in non-functional currencies, with foreign currency exchange contracts. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. Open foreign currency exchange contracts mature in the next twelve months. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had contracts with notional amounts of $9,554 million and $10,538 million to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S. Dollar, Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi, Indian Rupee, Mexican Peso, Singapore Dollar, U.A.E. Dirham and Swiss Franc.We have also designated foreign currency debt as hedges against portions of our net investment in foreign operations during the year ended December 31, 2016. Gains or losses on the effective portion of the foreign currency debt designated as a net investment hedge are recorded in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. The Company did not have ineffectiveness related to net investment hedges during the year ended December 31, 2016.##TABLE_START 55 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Interest Rate Risk Management We use a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively changed $1,850 million and $1,100 million of fixed rate debt at rates of 3.39% and 4.00% to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Our interest rate swaps mature at various dates through 2026.Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The FASBs accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:##TABLE_START   December 31,   2016  2015 Assets:         Foreign currency exchange contracts  $ 152   $ 28  Available for sale investments   1,670    1,501  Interest rate swap agreements   69    92           Liabilities:         Foreign currency exchange contracts  $ 2   $ 17  Interest rate swap agreements   48    -  ##TABLE_END The foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale and are valued using published prices based off observable market data. As such, these investments are classified within level 2.The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were not carried at fair value:##TABLE_START   December 31, 2016  December 31, 2015   Carrying Value  Fair Value  Carrying Value  Fair Value Assets                 Long-term receivables  $ 280   $ 273   $ 292   $ 283  Liabilities                 Long-term debt and related current maturities  $ 12,409   $ 13,008   $ 6,131   $ 6,721  ##TABLE_END The Company determined the fair value of the long-term receivables by discounting based upon the terms of the receivable and counterparty details including credit quality. As such, the fair value of these receivables is considered level 2. The Company determined the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities utilizing transactions in the listed markets for identical or similar liabilities. As such, the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities is considered level 2 as well.Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or losses on the derivative recognized in interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt##TABLE_START 56 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) being hedged. Losses on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $71 million and $2 million in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Gains on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $38 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Gains and losses are fully offset by losses and gains on the underlying debt being hedged.We also economically hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts. These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. We recognized $232 million of income in other (income) expense in the year ended December 31, 2016. We recognize $86 million and $181 million of expense in other (income) expense in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans The 2016 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (2016 Plan) and 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (2016 Directors Plan) were both approved by the shareowners at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners effective on April 25, 2016. Following approval of both plans, we have not and will not grant any new awards under any previously existing stock-based compensation plans. At December 31, 2016, there were 46,365,609, and 960,609 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants under terms of the 2016 Plan and 2016 Directors Plan, respectively.Stock Options  The exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under our stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of our stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employees requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years.The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.Compensation cost on a pre-tax basis related to stock options recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $87 million, $78 million and $85 million. The associated future income tax benefit recognized in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $29 million, $26 million and $31 million.The following table sets forth fair value per share information, including related weighted-average assumptions, used to determine compensation cost:##TABLE_START 60 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future.With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of##TABLE_START 63 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties.The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded liabilities for environmental costs:##TABLE_START   Years Ended December 31,   2016  2015  2014 Beginning of year  $ 518   $ 591   $ 643  Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable   195    194    268  Environmental liability payments   (228 )   (273 )   (321 ) Other   26    6    1  End of year  $ 511   $ 518   $ 591  ##TABLE_END Environmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts:##TABLE_START   December 31,    2016   2015 Accrued liabilities  $ 252   $ 253  Other liabilities   259    265    $ 511   $ 518  ##TABLE_END We do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined although they could be material to our consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, NY In 2016, we largely completed a dredging/capping remedy of Onondaga Lake pursuant to a consent decree approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York in January 2007. Some additional long-term monitoring and maintenance activities will continue, as required by the consent decree. Honeywell is also conducting remedial investigations and activities at other sites in Syracuse. We have recorded reserves for these investigations and activities where appropriate, consistent with the accounting policy described above.Honeywell has entered into a cooperative agreement with potential natural resource trustees to assess alleged natural resource damages relating to this site. It is not possible to predict the outcome or duration of this assessment, or the amounts of, or responsibility for, any damages.Asbestos Matters  Honeywell is a defendant in asbestos related personal injury actions related to two predecessor companies:##TABLE_START  North American Refractories Company (NARCO), which was sold in 1986, produced refractory products (bricks and cement used in high temperature applications).

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) and future NARCO asbestos claims. Both Honeywell and NARCO are protected by a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products to be made against the NARCO Trust. The NARCO Trust reviews submitted claims and determines award amounts in accordance with established Trust Distribution Procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court which set forth the criteria claimants must meet to qualify for compensation including, among other things, exposure and medical criteria that determine the award amount. In addition, Honeywell provided, and continues to provide, input to the design of control procedures for processing NARCO claims, and has on-going audit rights to review and monitor the claims processors adherence to the established requirements of the Trust Distribution Procedures.Honeywell is obligated to fund NARCO asbestos claims submitted to the NARCO Trust which qualify for payment under the Trust Distribution Procedures (Annual Contribution Claims), subject to annual caps of $140 million in the years 2017 and 2018 and $145 million for each year thereafter. However, the initial $100 million of claims processed through the NARCO Trust (the Initial Claims Amount) will not count against the annual cap and any unused portion of the Initial Claims Amount will roll over to subsequent years until fully utilized. In 2015, Honeywell filed suit against the NARCO Trust in Bankruptcy Court alleging breach of certain provisions of the Trust Agreement and Trust Distribution Procedures. The parties agreed to dismiss the proceeding without prejudice pursuant to an 18 month Standstill Agreement that expires in October 2017. Claims processing will continue during this period subject to a defined dispute resolution process. As of December 31, 2016, Honeywell has not made any payments to the NARCO Trust for Annual Contribution Claims.Honeywell is also responsible for payments due to claimants pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and Trust Distribution Procedures criteria (Pre-established Unliquidated Claims), which amounts are estimated at $150 million and are expected to be paid during the initial years of trust operations ($5 million of which has been paid since the effective date of the NARCO Trust). Such payments are not subject to the annual cap described above.Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for pre-established unliquidated claims ($145 million), unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection ($31 million) and for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust ($743 million). The estimate of future NARCO claims is based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts and also reflects disputes concerning implementation of the Trust Distribution Procedures by the NARCO Trust, a lack of sufficient trust claims processing experience, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims which remained in place throughout NARCOs Chapter 11 case. Some critical assumptions underlying this commonly accepted methodology include claims filing rates, disease criteria and payment values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures, estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances. The estimated value of future NARCO claims was originally established at the time of the NARCO Chapter 11 filing reflecting claims expected to be asserted against NARCO over a fifteen year period. This projection resulted in a range of estimated liability of $743 million to $961 million. We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range.Our insurance receivable corresponding to the estimated liability for pending and future NARCO asbestos claims reflects coverage which reimburses Honeywell for portions of NARCO-related indemnity and defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. We conduct analyses to estimate the probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos claims. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. We made judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers.Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the NARCO-related asbestos liabilities or assets to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. Given the uncertainties, we review our estimates periodically, and update them based on our experience and other relevant factors. Similarly, we will reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability or other developments that may impact insurance recoveries.##TABLE_START 66 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

We have valued Bendix pending and future claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix pending and future claims during the fourth quarter each year.The liability for future claims represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury claims expected to be asserted against Bendix over the next five years. Such estimated cost of future Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. The methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims is similar to that used to estimate the liability for future NARCO-related asbestos claims.Our insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of pending and future Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the solvency of our insurers, judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with our insurers.##TABLE_START 67 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Honeywell believes it has sufficient insurance coverage and reserves to cover all pending Bendix-related asbestos claims and Bendix-related asbestos claims estimated to be filed within the next five years. Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of either pending or future Bendix-related asbestos claims, we do not believe that such claims would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position in light of our insurance coverage and our prior experience in resolving such claims. If the rate and types of claims filed, the average resolution value of such claims and the period of time over which claim settlements are paid (collectively, the Variable Claims Factors) do not substantially change, Honeywell would not expect future Bendix-related asbestos claims to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in any fiscal year. No assurances can be given, however, that the Variable Claims Factors will not change . Other Matters  We are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Included in these other matters are the following: Honeywell v. United Auto Workers (UAW) et. al In July 2011, Honeywell filed an action in federal court (District of New Jersey) against the UAW and all former employees who retired under a series of Master Collective Bargaining Agreements (MCBAs) between Honeywell and the UAW seeking a declaratory judgment that certain express limitations on its obligation to contribute toward the healthcare coverage of such retirees (the CAPS) set forth in the MCBAs may be implemented, effective January 1, 2012. The UAW and certain retiree defendants filed a mirror suit in the Eastern District of Michigan alleging that the MCBAs do not provide for CAPS on the Companys liability for healthcare coverage. The New Jersey action was dismissed and Honeywell subsequently answered the UAWs complaint in Michigan and asserted counterclaims for fraudulent inducement, negligent misrepresentation and breach of implied warranty. The UAW filed a motion to dismiss these counterclaims. The court dismissed Honeywells fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation claims, but let stand the claim for breach of implied warranty. In the second quarter of 2014, the parties agreed to stay the proceedings with respect to those retirees who retired before the initial inclusions of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA until the Supreme Court decided the MG Polymers USA, LLC v. Tackett case . In a ruling on January 26, 2015, the Supreme Court held that retiree health insurance benefits provided in collective bargaining agreements do not carry an inference that they are vested or guaranteed to continue for life and that the vesting issue must be decided pursuant to ordinary principles of contract law. The stay of the proceedings has been lifted and the case is again proceeding. Based on the Supreme Courts ruling, Honeywell is confident that the CAPS will be upheld and that its liability for healthcare coverage premiums with respect to the putative class will be limited as negotiated and expressly set forth in the applicable MCBAs. In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywells other postretirement benefits for pre-2003 retirees would increase by approximately $129 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS. In December 2013, the UAW and certain of the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment with respect to those retirees who retired after the initial inclusion of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA. The UAW sought a ruling that the 2003 MCBA did not limit Honeywells obligation to contribute to healthcare coverage for the post-2003 retirees. That motion remains pending. Honeywell is confident that the Court will find that the 2003 MCBA does, in fact, limit Honeywells retiree healthcare obligation for post-2003 retirees. In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywells other postretirement benefits for post-2003 retirees would increase by approximately $95 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS.Joint Strike Fighter Investigation - In 2013 the Company received subpoenas from the Department of Justice requesting information relating primarily to parts manufactured in the United Kingdom and China used in the F-35 fighter jet. The Company is cooperating fully with the investigation. While we believe that Honeywell has complied with all relevant U.S. laws and regulations regarding the manufacture of these sensors, it is not possible##TABLE_START 68 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) to predict the outcome of the investigation or what action, if any, may result from it.Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations (including the specific matters referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above). Considering our past experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid.Warranties and Guarantees In the normal course of business we issue product warranties and product performance guarantees. We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale. Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties and guarantees are made as changes to the obligations become reasonably estimable. The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded obligations for product warranties and product performance guarantees.##TABLE_START   Years Ended December 31,   2016  2015  2014 Beginning of year  $ 416   $ 403   $ 405  Accruals for warranties/guarantees issued during the year   326    206    225  Adjustment of pre-existing warranties/guarantees   (40 )   13    (34 ) Settlement of warranty/guarantee claims   (215 )   (206 )   (193 ) End of year  $ 487   $ 416   $ 403  ##TABLE_END Product warranties and product performance guarantees are included in the following balance sheet accounts:##TABLE_START   December 31,   2016  2015 Accrued liabilities  $ 351   $ 355  Other liabilities   136    61    $ 487   $ 416  ##TABLE_END Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywells U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate.We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywells U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, more than 80% of Honeywells U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow.##TABLE_START 69 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

To determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments. We use the single weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations.During the fourth quarter of 2015 we changed the methodology used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit (income) cost for our significant pension plans. Previously, we estimated such cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the pension benefit obligation. The new methodology utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these cost components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. The change did not affect the measurement of our pension obligation and was applied prospectively as a change in estimate. For our U.S. pension plans, the single weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2017 are 4.42% and 3.49%.Our expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 7.75% is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations. We review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate.For non-U.S. benefit plans actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country.Pension Benefits Included in the aggregate data in the tables above are the amounts applicable to our pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets. Amounts related to such plans were as follows:##TABLE_START   December 31,    U.S. Plans   Non-U.S. Plans    2016   2015   2016   2015  Projected benefit obligation  $ 17,414   $ 17,298   $ 2,294   $ 1,624  Accumulated benefit obligation  $ 17,263   $ 16,899   $ 2,220   $ 1,574  Fair value of plan assets  $ 16,814   $ 16,349   $ 1,552   $ 976  ##TABLE_END Accumulated benefit obligation for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $17.3 billion and $16.9 billion and for our Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $6.4 billion and $6.2 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015.Our asset investment strategy for our U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve our long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. Our##TABLE_START 74 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) actual invested positions in various securities change over time based on short and longer-term investment opportunities. To achieve our objectives, we have established long-term target allocations as follows: 60%-70% equity securities, 10%-20% fixed income securities and cash, 5%-15% real estate investments, and 10%-20% other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located both inside and outside the United States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies. We review our assets on a regular basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations.Our non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing funding and investment guidance. Our non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country as local regulations, funding requirements, and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country.In accordance with ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the following tables are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented for the total pension benefits plan assets.The fair values of both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans assets by asset category are as follows:##TABLE_START   U.S. Plans   December 31, 2016   Total  Level 1  Level 2   Level 3  Equities:               Honeywell common stock  $ 2,140   $ 2,140   $ -   $ -  U.S. equities   3,583    3,583    -    -  Non-U.S. equities   2,069    2,037    32    -  Real estate investment trusts   203    203    -    -  Fixed income:                 Short term investments   1,306    1,306    -    -  Government securities   305    -    305    -  Corporate bonds   4,366    -    4,366    -  Mortgage/Asset-backed securities   617    -    617    -  Insurance contracts   7    -    7    -  Direct investments:                 Direct private investments   609    -    -    609  Real estate properties   664    -    -    664  Total   15,869   $ 9,269   $ 5,327   $ 1,273  Investments measured at NAV:                 Private funds   815              Real estate funds   110              Hedge funds   20              Total assets at fair value  $ 16,814              ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 75 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Sufficient cash or cash equivalents are held by our pension plans to cover the notional value of the futures contracts. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $3,775 million and $2,613 million. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $55 million and $54 million. In both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is primarily related to outstanding equity futures contracts.Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgages, asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in collective trust funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals.Our general funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made. We are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2017. In 2016, contributions of $149 million were made to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. In 2017, we expect to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $130 million to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Contributions for both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets.Benefit payments, including amounts to be paid from Company assets, and reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:##TABLE_START 78 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Segment Financial Data We globally manage our business operations through four reportable operating segments. Segment information is consistent with how management reviews the businesses, makes investing and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance.Honeywells senior management evaluates segment performance based on segment profit. Segment profit is measured as business unit income (loss) before taxes excluding general corporate unallocated expense, other income (expense), interest and other financial charges, pension and other postretirement benefits (expense), stock compensation expense and repositioning and other charges.In July 2016, the Company announced the realignment of the business units comprising its Automation and Control Solutions reporting segment by forming two new reportable operating segments: Home and Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions. Home and Building Technologies includes Environmental  Energy Solutions, Security and Fire, and Building Solutions and Distribution. Additionally, the Industrial Combustion/Thermal business, previously part of Environmental  Energy Solutions in Automation and Control Solutions, became part of Performance Materials and Technologies. Safety and Productivity Solutions includes##TABLE_START 79 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Sensing  Productivity Solutions and Industrial Safety, as well as the Intelligrated business. Under the realigned segment reporting structure, the Companys reportable operating segments are Aerospace, Home and Building Technologies, Performance Materials and Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions. These realignments have no impact on the Companys historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period segment presentation.##TABLE_START   Years Ended December 31, Net Sales  2016  2015  2014 Aerospace             Product  $ 9,926   $ 10,379   $ 10,773  Service   4,825    4,858    4,825  Total   14,751    15,237    15,598  Home and Building Technologies             Product   9,374    7,985    8,267  Service   1,280    1,176    1,218  Total   10,654    9,161    9,485  Performance Materials and Technologies             Product   7,601    7,674    8,662  Service   1,671    1,801    1,815  Total   9,272    9,475    10,477  Safety and Productivity Solutions             Product   4,461    4,657    4,696  Service   164    51    50  Total   4,625    4,708    4,746    $ 39,302   $ 38,581   $ 40,306               Depreciation and amortization             Aerospace  $ 275   $ 267   $ 277  Home and Building Technologies   192    101    114  Performance Materials and Technologies   314    285    292  Safety and Productivity Solutions   188    173    184  Corporate   61    57    57    $ 1,030   $ 883   $ 924               Segment Profit             Aerospace  $ 2,991   $ 3,218   $ 2,915  Home and Building Technologies   1,683    1,512    1,455  Performance Materials and Technologies   2,050    1,990    1,876  Safety and Productivity Solutions   680    746    686  Corporate   (218 )   (210 )   (236 )   $ 7,186   $ 7,256   $ 6,696  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 80 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Honeywell International Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.##TABLE_START 83 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for employee share-based payments in 2016 and 2015 due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, CompensationStock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ./s/ Deloitte  Touche LLPParsippany, New JerseyFebruary 10, 2017##TABLE_START 84 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Honeywell International Inc.:In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 present fairly, in all material respects, the results of operations and cash flows of Honeywell International Inc. and its subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

Competition We are subject to competition in substantially all product and service areas. Some of our key competitors are: ##TABLE_START    Aerospace: Borg-Warner (automotive), Garmin, General Electric, Rockwell Collins, Thales and United Technologies    Home and Building Technologies: Emerson Electric, Itron, Johnson Controls, Schneider and Siemens    Performance Materials and Technologies: Albemarle, BASF, Dow, Dupont, Emerson and Sinopec    Safety and Productivity Solutions: 3M, Mine Safety Appliances (MSA), Kion Group, TE Connectivity and Zebra Technologies ##TABLE_END Our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of OEMs. Aerospace Sales Our Aerospace segment sales were 36%, 38% and 39% of our total sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Our sales to commercial aerospace OEMs were 6%, 6% and 8% of our total sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015. In addition, our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 13%, 12% and 12% of our total sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015. U.S. Government Sales Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by Aerospace), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $3,203 million, $3,330 million and $3,743 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a prime contractor and subcontractor, of $2,546 million, $2,647 million and $2,680 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015. U.S. defense spending decreased in 2017 compared to 2016. We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2018 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEMs production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs), as well as our diversified commercial businesses. Backlog Our total backlog at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $17,690 million and $17,277 million. We anticipate that approximately $12,337 million of the 2017 backlog will be filled in 2018. We believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option. The 2016 backlog previously disclosed has been revised to apply the methodology used for the 2017 backlog and excludes certain previously included amounts that do not meet the criteria for inclusion. International Operations We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development (RD) globally. U.S. exports and non-U.S. manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 12% of our total sales in 2017, 13% in 2016 and 14% in 2015. Non-U.S. manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 44% of our total sales in 2017, 43% in 2016 and 39% in 2015. ##TABLE_START          Manufactured Products and Systems and Performance of Services  Year Ended December 31, 2017  Aerospace  Home and Building Technologies  Performance Materials and Technologies  Safety and Productivity Solutions   (% of Segment Sales) U.S. Exports   21 %    1 %    15 %    4 %  Non-U.S.   34 %    50 %    54 %    41 %  ##TABLE_END Information related to risks attendant to our foreign operations is included in Item 1A. Risk Factors under the caption Macroeconomic and Industry Risks. Raw Materials The principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available. Although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply, we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2017. We are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials. The costs of certain key raw materials, including R240, fluorspar, copper, ethylene and perchloroethylene in Performance Materials and Technologies and nickel, steel, titanium and other metals in Aerospace, are expected to continue to fluctuate. We will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2018. Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business. Research and Development The Companys principal research and development activities are in the U.S., India, Europe, and China. Research and development expense totaled $1,835 million, $1,864 million and $1,856 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015. RD expense was 5% of sales in each of 2017, 2016 and 2015. Customer-sponsored (principally by the U.S. Government) RD activities amounted to an additional $876 million, $967 million and $998 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Environment We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacturing, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is also possible that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys National Priority List. Although there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we do not anticipate having to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole. We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Companys business or markets that it serves, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures, earnings, competitive position or financial standing. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. Employees We have approximately 131,000 employees at December 31, 2017, of whom approximately 46,000 are located in the United States. Executive Officers of the Registrant The executive officers of Honeywell, listed as follows, are elected annually by the Board of Directors.

Risk Factors Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements We describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in other parts of this report (including this Item 1A). Such discussions contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements, including with respect to any changes in or abandonment of the proposed spin-offs. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Risk Factors Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Macroeconomic and Industry Risks Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations. ##TABLE_START    Aerospace Operating results of Aerospace are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, as well as changes in customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions and capacity constraints. The operating results of our Commercial Aviation business unit may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and global flying hours, which impact air transport, regional, business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as, new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain. Operating results in our Transportation Systems business unit may be affected by the level of production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, growing importance of automotive electrification, consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products and delays in launch schedules for new automobile and truck platforms.    Home and Building Technologies Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global residential and commercial construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects, less industrial plant expansion, changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels.    Performance Materials and Technologies Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply volatility, product commoditization, and our ability to maximize our facilities production capacity and minimize downtime. In particular, the volatility in oil and natural gas prices have and will continue to impact our customers operating levels and capital spending and thus demand for our products and services.    Safety and Productivity Solutions Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global capital spending and operating expenditures, including in the ##TABLE_END 6 ##TABLE_START    oil and gas industry, reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives, fluctuations in retail markets, lower customer demand due to the failure to anticipate and respond to overall trends related to end market demand, changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and technology that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices and lower margins. ##TABLE_END An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations. Our international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Companys sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes), violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate these risks), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, including the United Kingdom referendum in favor of exiting the European Union and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory and economic landscape, the potential for changes in global trade policies including sanctions and trade barriers, trends such as populism, economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies, and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. Operating outside of the United States also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss. Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. Operational Risks Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities. The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in Performance Materials and Technologies (R240, fluorspar, copper, ethylene and perchloroethylene) and in Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations. Many major components, product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, and during integration we may discover cybersecurity and compliance issues. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification. The proposed spin-offs of our Homes and Global Distribution business and of our Transportation Systems business into two stand-alone, publicly-traded companies are each contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline, or at all, and may not achieve the intended benefits. On October 10, 2017, the Company announced its intention to separately spin-off our Homes and Global Distribution business, which is part of our Home and Building Technologies segment, and our Transportation Systems business, which is part of our Aerospace segment, into two stand-alone, publicly-traded companies. Completion of each proposed spin-off is subject to readiness of each spin-off to operate as an independent public company, finalization of the financial statements of the spun-off business, assurance that the separation will be tax-free to our shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes, finalization of the capital structure of the three corporations, the effectiveness of appropriate filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, final approval of the Board of Directors, and other customary matters. Each proposed spin-off is complex in nature, and may be affected by unanticipated developments, credit and equity markets, or changes in market conditions. These or other unanticipated developments could delay or prevent the proposed spin-offs or cause the proposed spin-offs to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable than anticipated, including without limitation, the failure to qualify as tax-free to our shareowners, and the inability of the two spun-off companies to incur sufficient indebtedness to allow for a distribution to Honeywell of proceeds concurrently with the consummation of the spin-offs or to make ongoing cash contributions towards the satisfaction of certain of our legacy asbestos and environmental remediation liabilities. Furthermore, if the spin-offs are completed, we cannot assure you that each will be successful in meeting its objectives. There is the potential for business disruption and significant separation costs. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or the price of our common stock. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins. Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors including many new and non-traditional competitors, (iv) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (v) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively, (vi) monitor disruptive technologies and business models, (vii) achieve sufficient return on investment for new products introduced based on capital expenditures and research and development spending, (viii) respond to changes in overall trends related to end market demand, and (x) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses. Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, attrition, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations. As a supplier to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unique risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future. We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third party service providers, including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. Data privacy, identity protection, and information security may require significant resources and presents certain risks. We collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data and other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect such data, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, or employee errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. A material disruption of our operations, particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our information technology infrastructure, could adversely affect our business. Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters including hurricanes and floods, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, equipment failures, sabotage, adverse weather conditions, public health crises, labor disputes, critical supply failure, inaccurate downtime forecast, political disruption, and other reasons, which can result in undesirable consequences, including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers. We employ information technology systems and networks to support the business and rely on them to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Disruptions to our information technology infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, and other events, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server, systems and other third party IT service providers, could interfere with our operations, interrupt production and shipments, damage customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact our reputation. Legal and Regulatory Risks Our U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. tax reform legislation as well as multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), will increase tax uncertainty and impact our provision for income taxes. Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety, performance and product certification regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial Aftermarket may be impacted by, among other things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations, while emissions, fuel economy and energy efficiency standards for motor vehicles can impact Transportation Systems. Within Home and Building Technologies, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies results of operations can be impacted by environmental standards, regulations, and judicial determinations. Growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive. Noncompliance with legislation and regulations can result in fines and penalties. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, import and export, and environmental, health and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters under the caption Equity Compensation Plans. Honeywell purchased 10,300,000 shares of its common stock, par value $1 per share, in the quarter ending December 31, 2017. In December 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $8 billion of Honeywell common stock, which included amounts remaining under and replaced the previously approved share repurchase program. $7.7 billion remained available as of as of December 31, 2017 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of our operating, financing and other investing activities.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Honeywell International Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (Honeywell or the Company) for the three years ended December 31, 2017. All references to Notes relate to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In October 2017, the Company announced the results of a comprehensive portfolio review which included the announcement of our intent to spin-off our Homes and Global Distribution business, as well as our Transportation Systems business, into two stand-alone, publicly traded companies. Effective October 2017, we realigned the Smart Energy business, previously part of the Home and Building Technologies segment, into the Process Solutions business within the Performance Materials and Technologies segment. Effective July 2016, the Company realigned the business units comprising its Automation and Control Solutions segment by forming two new segments: Home and Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions. These realignments have no impact on the Companys historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period segment presentation. On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off of its Resins and Chemicals business, part of Performance Materials and Technologies, into a standalone, publicly-traded company (named AdvanSix Inc. (AdvanSix)) to Honeywell shareowners. The assets and liabilities associated with AdvanSix have been removed from the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the effective date of the spin-off. The results of operations for AdvanSix are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations through the effective date of the spin-off. On September 16, 2016, the Company completed the sale of the Aerospace government services business, Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc (HTSI or government services business). The assets and liabilities associated with HTSI have been removed from the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the effective date of the sale. The results of operations for HTSI are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations through the effective date of the sale. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY During 2017, Honeywell continued to successfully deliver on its financial commitments while still creating long-term value for our shareowners. We grew net sales 3% to $40,534 million and grew income before taxes 7% to $6,902 million. The improvement in year over year income before taxes was attributable to both organic sales growth as well as operational improvements that increased operating margins. We believe our ability to consistently grow earnings derives from the consistent, rigorous deployment of the Honeywell Operating System as well as a long history of identifying and investing in productivity initiatives. We have made concerted efforts to revitalize our commercial excellence processes, such as Velocity Product Development (VPD), which enables higher organic revenue at better margins. We are careful to not allow the attainment of short-term financial results imperil the creation of long-term, sustainable shareowner value. Hence, as part of the announcement in October 2017 of the results of our portfolio review, we affirmed our commitment to a strategy and investments that are intended to enable us to become one of the worlds leading software industrial companies. Our refocused strategy and investments are intended to take better advantage of our core technological and software strengths in high growth businesses that participate in six attractive industrial end markets. Each of these end markets is characterized by favorable global mega-trends including energy efficiency, infrastructure investment, urbanization and safety. In 2017 we deployed capital of over $6 billion, including the following: ##TABLE_START    Share Repurchases we continue to repurchase our shares with the goal of keeping share count flat by offsetting the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation and savings plans. Additionally, we seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. In 2017, we repurchased 20.5 million shares for $2.9 billion.    Dividend In 2017, we paid cash dividends of $2.1 billion and increased our annual dividend rate by 12%, as we seek to continue to grow the dividend faster than earnings. Since 2010, we have increased the dividend rate by 10% or more eight times.    Capital Investment in Facilities we invested over $1 billion in capital expenditures focused on high return projects. ##TABLE_END CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales ##TABLE_START          2017  2016  2015 Net sales  $  40,534   $  39,302   $  38,581  % change compared with prior period   3 %    2 %    ##TABLE_END The change in net sales is attributable to the following: ##TABLE_START        2017 Versus 2016  2016 Versus 2015 Volume   3%    (2)%  Price   1%      Acquisitions/Divestitures   (1)%    5%  Foreign Currency Translation       (1)%         3%    2%       ##TABLE_END A discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this MDA. The foreign currency translation impact in 2017 compared with 2016 was flat. The strengthening of the Euro was offset by the weakening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar. The foreign currency translation impact in 2016 compared with 2015 is principally driven by the weakening of the British Pound, Chinese Renminbi and Canadian Dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar. Cost of Products and Services Sold ##TABLE_START          2017  2016  2015 Cost of products and services sold  $  27,575   $  27,150   $  26,747  % change compared with prior period   2 %    2 %    Gross Margin percentage   32.0 %    30.9 %    30.7 %  ##TABLE_END Cost of products and services sold increased in 2017 compared with 2016 principally due to increased direct material costs of approximately $290 million (driven by higher sales volume and acquisitions partially offset by divestitures and productivity, net of inflation), higher repositioning and other charges of approximately $260 million and higher depreciation and amortization of approximately $90 million, partially offset by higher pension and other postretirement benefits income, and lower pension mark-to-market expense, allocated to cost of products and services sold of approximately $110 million, and decreased indirect material costs of approximately $70 million. Gross margin percentage increased in 2017 compared with 2016 principally due to higher gross margin in Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies (approximately 1.7 percentage point impact collectively) and higher pension and other postretirement benefits income and lower pension market to market expense allocated to cost of products and services sold (approximately 0.3 percentage point impact), partially offset by higher repositioning and other charges (approximately 0.6 percentage point impact) and by lower gross margin in Home and Building Solutions and Safety and Productivity Solutions (approximately 0.3 percentage point impact collectively). Cost of products and services sold increased in 2016 compared with 2015 principally due to increased direct material costs of approximately $380 million (driven primarily by acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by the favorable impact of productivity, net of inflation, and foreign currency translation), higher depreciation and amortization attributable to acquisitions of approximately $135 million and increased pension mark-to-market expense allocated to cost of products and services sold of $70 million, partially offset by higher pension and other postretirement benefits income allocated to cost of products and services sold of $200 million. Gross margin percentage increased in 2016 compared with 2015 principally due to higher gross margin in Performance Materials and Technologies (approximately 0.2 percentage point impact) and higher pension and other postretirement benefits income allocated to cost of products and services sold (approximately 0.5 percentage point impact), partially offset by lower gross margin in Aerospace, Home and Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions an (approximately 0.3 percentage point impact collectively) and increased pension mark-to-market expense allocated to cost of products and services sold (approximately 0.2 percentage point impact). Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ##TABLE_START          2017  2016  2015 Selling, general and administrative expense  $  5,808   $  5,469   $  5,006  % of sales   14.3 %    13.9 %    13.0 %  ##TABLE_END Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) increased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to increased labor costs (driven primarily by acquisitions, net of divestitures, investment for growth and merit increases), and higher repositioning charges, partially offset by decreased pension mark-to-market expense allocated to SGA. SGA increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to increased labor costs (driven primarily by acquisitions, net of divestitures, investment for growth and merit increases), increased pension mark-to-market expense allocated to SGA and higher repositioning charges, partially offset by the favorable impact from foreign currency translation and increased pension income allocated to SGA. Tax Expense ##TABLE_START          2017  2016  2015 Tax expense  $  5,204   $  1,601   $  1,739  Effective tax rate   75.4 %    24.8 %    26.4 %  ##TABLE_END On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) that instituted fundamental changes to the U.S. tax system. The Tax Act includes changes to the taxation of foreign earnings by implementing a dividend exemption system, expansion of the current anti-deferral rules, a minimum tax on low-taxed foreign earnings and new measures to deter base erosion. The Tax Act also permanently reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposes a one-time mandatory transition tax on the historical earnings of foreign affiliates and implements a territorial style tax system. The impacts of these changes are reflected in the 2017 tax expense which resulted in a provisional charge of approximately $3.8 billion, which is subject to adjustment given the provisional nature of the charge. This resulted in an effective tax rate higher than the statutory rate in 2017. The effective tax rates for 2016 and 2015 were lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lower tax rates on non-U.S. earnings. The Company currently expects the effective tax rate for 2018 to be in the range of 22.0% and 23.0%. The effective tax rate may vary from quarter to quarter due to unusual or infrequently occurring items, the resolution of income tax audits, changes in tax laws, the tax impact from employee share-based payments, taxes incurred in connection to the territorial style tax system, or other items such as pension mark-to-market adjustments. For further discussion of changes in the effective tax rate, see Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Income Attributable to Honeywell ##TABLE_START          2017  2016  2015 Net income attributable to Honeywell  $  1,655   $  4,809   $  4,768  Earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution  $  2.14   $  6.20   $  6.04  ##TABLE_END Earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily driven by additional income tax expense from the Tax Act, higher repositioning and other charges, partially offset by higher segment profit across all segments, lower pension mark-to-market expense and increased pension and other postretirement income. Earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily driven by increased pension and other postretirement income, higher segment profit in Home and Building Technologies and Performance Materials and Technologies, the gain related to the Honeywell Technology Solutions, Inc. divestiture, a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding and the tax benefit from adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) accounting standard related to employee share-based payment accounting, partially offset by lower segment profit in Aerospace and Safety and Productivity Solutions, increased pension mark-to-market expense and higher repositioning and other charges. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Our consolidated results are principally impacted by: ##TABLE_START    Changes in global economic growth rates and industry conditions and demand in our key end markets;    The impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (in particular the Euro), relative to the U.S. Dollar;    The extent to which cost savings from productivity actions are able to offset or exceed the impact of material and non-material inflation;    The impact of the pension discount rate and asset returns on pension expense, including mark-to-market adjustments, and funding requirements; and    The impact from the Tax Act. ##TABLE_END Our 2018 areas of focus, most of which are applicable to each of our segments include: ##TABLE_START    Driving profitable organic growth through RD and technological excellence to deliver innovative products that customers value and expansion and localization of our footprint in high growth regions;    Executing on our strategy to become a software-industrial company, which for us means products and services that facilitate the connected plane, home, building and factory;    Expanding margins by maintaining and improving the Companys cost structure through manufacturing and administrative process improvements, repositioning, and other productivity actions;    Executing disciplined, rigorous MA and integration processes to deliver growth through acquisitions;    Ensuring the successful completion of the proposed spin-offs of our Homes and Global Distribution business, as well as our Transportation Systems business, into two stand-alone, publicly traded companies;    Controlling corporate costs, including costs incurred for asbestos and environmental matters, pension and other post-retirement benefits;    Increasing availability of capital through strong cash flow conversion from effective working capital management and proactively managing debt levels to enable the Company to smartly ##TABLE_END 20 ##TABLE_START    deploy capital for strategic acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases and capital expenditures; and    Aligning our operating structure to benefit from the territorial tax system being implemented by the Tax Act. ##TABLE_END Review of Business Segments ##TABLE_START              Years Ended December 31,  % Change  2017 Versus 2016  2016 Versus 2015  2017  2016  2015 Aerospace Sales           Commercial Aviation Original Equipment  $  2,475   $  2,525   $  2,905    (2 )%    (13 )%  Commercial Aviation Aftermarket   5,103    4,796    4,656    6 %    3 %  Defense and Space   4,053    4,375    4,715    (7 )%    (7 )%  Transportation Systems   3,148    3,055    2,961    3 %    3 %         Total Aerospace Sales   14,779    14,751    15,237      Home and Building Technologies Sales           Home and Building Products   4,928    4,803    4,576    3 %    5 %  Home and Building Distribution   4,849    4,687    4,450    3 %    5 %         Total Home and Building Technologies Sales   9,777    9,490    9,026      Performance Materials and Technologies Sales           UOP   2,753    2,469    2,976    12 %    (17 )%  Process Solutions   4,795    4,640    3,124    3 %    49 %  Advanced Materials   2,791    3,327    3,510    (16 )%    (5 )%         Total Performance Materials and Technologies Sales   10,339    10,436    9,610      Safety and Productivity Solutions Sales           Safety   2,169    2,075    2,135    5 %    (3 )%  Productivity Solutions   3,470    2,550    2,573    36 %    (1 )%         Total Safety and Productivity Solutions Sales   5,639    4,625    4,708             Net Sales  $  40,534   $  39,302   $  38,581             ##TABLE_END Aerospace ##TABLE_START              2017  2016  Change  2015  Change Net sales  $  14,779   $  14,751       $  15,237    (3 )%  Cost of products and services sold   10,320    10,820      11,068    Selling, general and administrative and other expenses   1,171    940      951             Segment profit  $  3,288   $  2,991    10 %   $  3,218    (7 )%           ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START          Factors Contributing to Year-Over-Year Change  2017 vs. 2016  2016 vs. 2015  Sales  Segment Profit  Sales  Segment Profit Organic growth/ Operational segment profit   2 %    11 %    (3 )%    (6 )%  Foreign currency translation               (1 )%  Acquisitions, divestitures and other, net   (2 )%    (1 )%                   Total % Change       10 %    (3 )%    (7 )%           ##TABLE_END 21 2017 compared with 2016 Aerospace sales were flat due to organic sales growth, offset by the government services business divestiture. ##TABLE_START    Commercial Original Equipment sales decreased 2% (decreased 2% organic) primarily due to lower shipments to business jet OEMs, partially offset by lower air transport and regional OEM incentives.    Commercial Aftermarket sales increased 6% (increased 6% organic) primarily driven by higher repair and overhaul activities and increased spares shipments.

Repositioning Charges See Note 3 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2017, 2016 and 2015. These repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pre-tax savings of $300 million in 2018 compared with 2017 principally from planned workforce reductions. Cash spending related to our repositioning actions was $177 million, $228 million and $118 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, and was funded through operating cash flows. In 2018, we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately $250 million and to be funded through operating cash flows. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, access to the public debt and equity markets and the ability to access non-U.S. cash as a result of the Tax Act. We continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. Cash Flow Summary Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows: ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2017  2016  2015 Cash provided by (used for):       Operating activities  $  5,966   $  5,498   $  5,519  Investing activities   (3,574 )    (3,342 )    (6,514 )  Financing activities   (3,516 )    346    37  Effect of exchange rate changes on cash   340    (114 )    (546 )         Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents  $  (784 )   $  2,388   $  (1,504 )         ##TABLE_END 2017 compared with 2016 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $468 million primarily due to a $504 million increase in segment profit and a $294 million favorable impact from working capital (favorable accounts payable partially offset by inventory and accounts receivable), partially offset by higher cash tax payments of $609 million. Cash used for investing activities increased by $232 million primarily due to (i) a net $2,056 million increase in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities, (ii) an increase of $500 million of settlement payments of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and (iii) a decrease in proceeds from the sales of businesses of $296 million (most significantly Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. in 2016), partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $2,491 million (most significantly Intelligrated in 2016). Cash used for financing activities increased by $3,862 million primarily due to a decrease in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $2,827 million, an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $699 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of $204 million. 2016 compared with 2015 Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $21 million primarily due to a $725 million unfavorable impact from working capital, offset by (i) a $395 million improvement in customer advances and deferred income, (ii) a $171 million increase in net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment (iii) the absence of $151 million in OEM incentive payments and (iv) lower cash tax payments of $50 million. Cash used for investing activities decreased by $3,172 million primarily due to (i) a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $2,655 million, most significantly Elster in 2015, (ii) an increase in proceeds from the sales of businesses of $295 million (most significantly Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc.) and (iii) a $384 million favorable change in settlements of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The decreases were partially offset by a net $146 million increase in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities. Cash provided by financing activities increased by $309 million primarily due to an increase in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $497 million, partially offset by an increase in cash dividends paid of $189 million including amounts paid to the former UOP Russell LLC noncontrolling shareholder. Liquidity Each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. Considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies, including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity. In addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. A source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings and commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2017 was (0.17%) and as of December 31, 2016 was (0.13%). Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2017, Standard and Poors (SP), Fitch, and Moodys have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1. SP, Fitch and Moodys have Honeywells rating outlook as stable. To date, the Company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity. We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 12 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity. In 2017, the Company repurchased $2,889 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we sought to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arose. In December 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $8 billion of Honeywell common stock, of which $7.7 billion remained available as of December 31, 2017 for additional share repurchases. This authorization included amounts remaining under and replaced the previously approved share repurchase program. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. We will continue to seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. At December 31, 2017, a substantial portion of the Companys cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company no longer intends to permanently reinvest its historical foreign earnings and plans to repatriate at least $7 billion of such earnings to the U.S. over the next two years. In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, dividends, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments. Specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2018 to be as follows: ##TABLE_START    Capital expenditureswe expect to spend approximately $900 million for capital expenditures in 2018 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement.    Share repurchasesunder the Companys share repurchase program, $7.7 billion is available as of December 31, 2017 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we will seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities.    Dividendswe increased our quarterly dividend rate by 12% to $.745 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2017 dividend. The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2018.    Asbestos claimswe expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $350 million and $24 million in 2018.    Pension contributionsin 2018, we are not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans. We plan to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $140 million ($99 million of marketable securities were contributed in January 2018) to our non-U.S. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. The timing and amount of contributions to both our U.S. and non-U.S. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans.    Repositioning actionswe expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute repositioning actions will be approximately $250 million in 2018.    Environmental remediation costswe expect to spend approximately $225 million in 2018 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs.    Spin-off separation costswe expect to incur significant cash expenditures associated with the announced spin-off transactions, including third party professional services and tax costs, the amounts of which are still being determined. ##TABLE_END We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2016, we realized $565 million in cash proceeds from sales and a spin-off of non-strategic businesses. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines and access to the public debt and equity markets, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. Contractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments Following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2017: ##TABLE_START              Total(6)  Payments by Period  Thereafter  2018  2019- 2020  2021- 2022 Long-term debt, including capitalized leases(1)  $  13,924   $  1,351   $  4,225   $  2,310   $  6,038  Interest payments on long-term debt, including capitalized leases   3,267    307    559    422    1,979  Minimum operating lease payments   1,126    295    387    218    226  Purchase obligations(2)   1,713    819    523    323    48  Estimated environmental liability payments(3)   595    226    271    89    9  Asbestos related liability payments(4)   1,523    350    731    407    35  Asbestos insurance recoveries(5)   (435 )    (24 )    (114 )    (84 )    (213 )               $  21,713   $  3,324   $  6,582   $  3,685   $  8,122             ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  (1)  Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity.  (2)  Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements.  (3)  The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2017.  (4)  These amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2017. See Asbestos Matters in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  (5)  These amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos related liabilities as of December 31, 2017. See Asbestos Matters in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  (6)  The table excludes tax liability payments, including those for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. ##TABLE_END Environmental Matters Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $287 million, $195 million and $194 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015. In addition, in 2017 and 2016 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $82 million and $83 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations. Spending related to known environmental matters was $212 million, $228 million and $273 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015 and is estimated to be approximately $225 million in 2018. We expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our environmental matters. Financial Instruments The following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at December 31, 2017 and 2016. ##TABLE_START            Face or Notional Amount  Carrying Value(1)  Fair Value(1)  Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value(2) December 31, 2017         Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments         Long-term debt (including current maturities)  $  13,924   $  (13,924 )   $  (14,695 )   $  (782 )  Interest rate swap agreements   2,600    (8 )    (8 )    (233 )  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments         Foreign currency exchange contracts(3)   9,273    (53 )    (53 )    (58 )  December 31, 2016         Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments         Long-term debt (including current maturities)  $  12,409   $  (12,409 )   $  (13,008 )   $  (537 )  Interest rate swap agreements   1,850    21    21    (112 )  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments         Foreign currency exchange contracts(3)   9,554    150    150    (195 )  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  (1)  Asset or (liability).

(3)  Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value, cash flows, or net investments of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions or foreign operations. ##TABLE_END See Note 14 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the agreements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Contingent Liabilities We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, legal and environmental, health and safety matters. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a thorough analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies. Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries Honeywells involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust. The estimate of future NARCO claims was prepared in 2002, in the same year NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection, using NARCO tort system litigation experience based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts. Accordingly, the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims was prepared before there was data on claims filings and payment rates in the NARCO Trust under the Trust Distribution Procedures and also prepared when the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims was in effect (which remained in effect until NARCO emerged from Bankruptcy protection). Some critical assumptions underlying this commonly accepted methodology included claims filing rates, disease criteria and payment values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures, estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances. The estimated value of the future NARCO liability reflects claims expected to be asserted against NARCO over a fifteen year period. This projection resulted in a range of estimated liability of $743 million to $961 million. We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. Given the Trusts lack of sufficient claims processing experience since NARCO emerged from bankruptcy protection, it is not yet possible to reliably estimate future claim costs based on actual Trust experience. Regarding Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix) asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. Annual pension (income) expense is comprised of service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets, prior service amortization (Pension Ongoing (Income) Expense) and a potential mark-to-market adjustment (MTM Adjustment). The key assumptions used in developing our 2017, 2016 and 2015 net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following: ##TABLE_START          2017  2016  2015 Discount Rate:       Projected benefit obligation   4.20 %    4.46 %    4.08 %  Service cost(1)   4.42 %    4.69 %    N/A  Interest cost(1)   3.49 %    3.59 %    N/A  Assets:       Expected rate of return   7.75 %    7.75 %    7.75 %  Actual rate of return   20.5 %    9.7 %    1.5 %  Actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return   7.4 %    6.4 %    6.8 %  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  (1)  N/A in 2015 as the discount rate methodology was changed in fourth quarter of 2015. See Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END The MTM Adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor). Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM charges were $87 million, $273 million and $67 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015. We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). We plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% for 2018 as this is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and the asset mix of the plans investments. The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We used a 3.68% discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of December 31, 2017, reflecting the decrease in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end. In addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment: ##TABLE_START      Change in Assumption  Impact on 2018 Pension Ongoing Expense  Impact on PBO 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate  Decrease $22 million  Increase $520 million 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate  Increase $22 million  Decrease $510 million 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets  Increase $47 million   0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets  Decrease $46 million   ##TABLE_END Pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately $984 million in 2018 compared with pension ongoing income of $713 million in 2017. The expected increase is primarily due to higher asset returns in 2017 in our U.S. and UK plans. Also, if required, an MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2018, and if one is required, what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. Long-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets) The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations;    Annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line;    Significant negative industry or economic trends; or    Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. ##TABLE_END Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry and business growth rates, sales volume, selling prices and costs, cash flows, and the discount rate selected. These estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility. Management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing. In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions. Income Taxes On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. Our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. Sales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts In 2017, we recognized approximately 16% of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts. These long-term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting Principles The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is a description of Honeywells significant accounting policies. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. Our consolidation policy requires equity investments that we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investees activities to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding assets useful life. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2017 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. Other Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years. Sales Recognition Product and service sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts are recorded on a percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident. Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis. Amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services. Environmental We accrue costs related to environmental matters when it is probable that we have incurred a liability related to a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies. Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Aerospace Sales Incentives We provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of our aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and braking system hardware, avionics, and auxiliary power units, for installation on commercial aircraft. These incentives consist of free or deeply discounted products, credits for future purchases of product and upfront cash payments. These costs are recognized in the period incurred as cost of products sold or as a reduction to sales, as appropriate. Research and Development Research and development costs for company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred. Such costs are principally included in cost of products sold and were $1,835 million, $1,864 million and $1,856 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015. The 2016 research and development costs previously disclosed have been revised to reflect the amounts recorded in the 2016 Consolidated Statement of Operations and had no impact on the results of operations. Stock-Based Compensation Plans The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 18 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units. The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and are based on our historical forfeiture rates. Pension Benefits We recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment), and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered. The remaining components of pension (income) expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recognized on a quarterly basis (Pension ongoing (income) expense). Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. Dollars are translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings. Derivative Financial Instruments We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. We do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract. All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is reported as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements We consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows (consolidated financial statements). In May 2014, and in following related amendments, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that supersedes upon adoption previous revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle requires an entity to recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of time value of money in the transaction price, and in certain circumstances, allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers. The Company has completed its evaluation of the new standard and has assessed the impacts of adoption on the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures. Based on the evaluation of our current contracts and revenue streams, revenue recognition is mostly consistent under both the previous and new standard, with the exception of two key revenue streams within our Aerospace segment, which are described below. First, the previous accounting policy for costs incurred for nonrecurring engineering and development activities of our Aerospace products with commercial customers was generally to record the expense as incurred. Any customer funding received for such efforts was recognized when earned as a reduction of cost of sales. Upon adoption of the new standard, the customer funding is generally classified as revenue and not as a reduction of cost of sales. Such revenues are deferred and HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) subsequently recognized as products are delivered to the customers. Additionally, under the new guidance, expenses incurred, up to the customer agreed funded amount, are deferred as an asset and subsequently recognized as cost of sales as products are delivered to the customer. As a result of these changes, both deferred costs (assets) and deferred revenue (liability) increased by approximately $1,090 million effective January 1, 2018. The aforementioned change in classification within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and timing difference in recognition is expected to have a minor impact on our gross margin percentage but no change to gross profit. Second, the accounting for revenues for our mechanical service programs at our Aerospace segment are impacted. Our previous policy was to recognize revenue over time as costs were incurred (input method). Upon adoption, we continue to recognize revenue over time, but recognition is based on a series of distinct services using the output method. At adoption, this change results in unbilled receivables and deferred revenue being eliminated through retained earnings. We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. The cumulative effect recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings of the above impacted revenue streams is $75 million. The disclosures in our notes to Consolidated Financial Statements related to revenue recognition will be significantly expanded under the new standard, specifically around the quantitative and qualitative information about performance obligations, changes in contract assets and liabilities, and disaggregation of revenue. In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases that will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We expect to adopt the requirements of the new standard effective January 1, 2019. The guidance requires the use of a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating our lease portfolio to assess overall financial statement impact and planning for adoption and implementation of this standard. We will continue to evaluate the adoption impact of this standard on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and related notes to financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, at the time the entity transfer occurs rather than when the asset is ultimately transferred to a third party, as required under current U.S. GAAP. The guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice, particularly for transfers involving intellectual property. Subsequent to 2017 fiscal year, we adopted the accounting standard update as of January 1, 2018. The guidance requires application on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance increases our deferred tax assets by approximately $340 million with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of the same amount. In March 2017, the FASB issued guidance on presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The new standard requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component of net benefit cost. The employer is required to report the service cost component in the same line item or items in the statement of operations as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component, such as in other income and expense. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Subsequent to 2017 fiscal year, we adopted the accounting standard update as of January 1, 2018. This guidance impacts the presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our current presentation of the service cost component is consistent with the requirements of the new standard. We will present the other components within Other (income) expense (we currently present the other components within Cost of products and services sold and HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Selling, general, and administrative expenses). All components will continue to be excluded from Segment Profit (see Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits for components of net period benefit cost). In August 2017, the FASB issued amendments to hedge accounting guidance. These amendments are intended to better align a companys risk management strategies and financial reporting for hedging relationships. Under the new guidance, more hedging strategies will be eligible for hedge accounting and the application of hedge accounting is simplified. In addition, the new guidance amends presentation and disclosure requirements. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted, including the interim periods within those years. The guidance requires the use of a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating whether to early adopt the new guidance and the impact of this amendment on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and related notes to financial statements. Note 2. Acquisitions and Divestitures During 2017 there were no significant acquisitions individually or in aggregate. During 2016, we acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash and debt assumed) of $2,538 million. In August 2016, the Company acquired Intelligrated, a leading provider of supply chain and warehouse automation technologies, for an aggregate value, net of cash acquired, of $1,488 million. Intelligrated is part of Safety and Productivity Solutions. In the third quarter of 2017, we completed our evaluation of the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities acquired. Management recorded goodwill and intangible assets acquired of, $1,121 million and $507 million, respectively. The Intelligrated identifiable intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, technology, and trade name that are being amortized over their estimated lives ranging from 1 to 15 years using straight line and accelerated amortization methods. The goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. In April 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Xtralis International Holdings Limited (Xtralis), a leading global provider of aspiration smoke detection and perimeter security technologies, for an aggregate cost, net of cash acquired and debt assumed, of $515 million. Xtralis is part of Home and Building Technologies. In February 2016, the Company acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of COM DEV International (COM DEV), a leading satellite and space components provider, for an aggregate value, net of cash acquired and debt assumed, of $347 million. COM DEV is part of Aerospace. In January 2016, the Company acquired the remaining 30 percent noncontrolling interest in UOP Russell LLC, which develops technology and manufactures modular equipment to process natural gas, for $240 million. UOP Russell LLC is part of Performance Materials and Technologies. In December 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the Elster Division of Melrose Industries plc (Elster), for an aggregate value, net of cash acquired, of $4,899 million. Elster had 2015 revenues of $1,670 million and has been integrated into Home and Building Technologies and HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

The goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off of its Resins and Chemicals business, part of Performance Materials and Technologies, into a standalone, publicly-traded company (named AdvanSix Inc. (AdvanSix)) to Honeywell shareowners. The assets and liabilities associated with AdvanSix have been removed from the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. The results of operations for AdvanSix are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations through the effective date of the spin-off. Honeywell shareowners of record as of the close of business on September 16, 2016 received one share of AdvanSix common stock for every 25 shares of Honeywell common stock. Immediately prior to the effective date of the spin-off, AdvanSix incurred debt to make a cash distribution of $269 million to the Company. At the same time, AdvanSix also incurred $38 million of borrowings in order to fund its post spin-off working capital. In 2016 in connection with the spin-off, the Company entered into certain agreements with AdvanSix to effect our legal and structural separation including a transition services agreement with AdvanSix to provide certain administrative and other services for a limited time. As of the end of 2017, most of those agreements have ended. On September 16, 2016, the Company completed the sale of Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. for a sale price of $300 million. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $176 million, which was recorded in Other (income) expense. The Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. business was part of Aerospace.

The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives and with site transitions, in each of our segments, to more cost-effective locations. The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $142 million principally in our Corporate segment related to the write-down of legacy properties and certain equipment in connection with their planned disposition and the write-down of a research and development facility in connection with a planned exit from such facility. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $60 million principally for closure obligations associated with site transitions in each of our segments and for lease exit obligations in our Corporate segment. In 2016, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $369 million including severance costs of $283 million related to workforce reductions of 6,585 manufacturing and administrative positions across our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives; the separation of the HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) former Automation and Control Solutions reporting segment into two new reporting segments; site transitions in each of our segments to more cost-effective locations; and achieving acquisition-related synergies. The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $43 million principally related to the write-off of certain intangible assets in connection with the sale of a Performance Materials and Technologies business. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $43 million principally for expenses related to the spin-off of our AdvanSix business and closure obligations associated with site transitions. Also, $109 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned to income as a result of higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments, lower than expected severance costs in certain repositioning actions, and changes in scope of previously announced repositioning actions. In 2015, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $216 million including severance costs of $197 million related to workforce reductions of 6,405 manufacturing and administrative positions across our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. Also, $53 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned to income due principally to higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments, and changes in scope of previously announced repositioning actions.

The increase was primarily attributable to the provisional impact of U.S. tax reform (see The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act further below), partially offset by increased tax benefits from foreign tax credits and for employee share-based payments. The Companys non-U.S. effective tax rate was 71.4%, an increase of approximately 54.7 percentage points compared to 2016. The year-over-year increase in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily driven by the Companys change in assertion regarding foreign unremitted earnings, increased expense for reserves in various jurisdictions and increased withholding taxes, partially offset by higher earnings in low tax rate jurisdictions. The effective tax rate decreased by 1.6 percentage points in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to excess tax benefits from employee share-based payments arising from adoption of the FASBs amended guidance related to employee share-based payment accounting, partially offset by increased tax reserves in various jurisdictions and lower tax benefits from manufacturing incentives. The Companys non-U.S effective tax rate was 16.7%, a decrease of approximately 2.8 percentage points compared to 2015. The year-over-year decrease in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily driven by higher earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and a decrease in the tax impact of restructuring and divestitures. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to overall non-U.S. earnings taxed at lower rates. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Our gross deferred tax assets include $794 million related to non-U.S. operations comprised principally of net operating losses, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards (mainly in Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom) and deductible temporary differences. We maintain a valuation allowance of $660 million against a portion of the non-U.S. gross deferred tax assets. The change in the valuation allowance resulted in increases of $4 million, $69 million and $114 million to income tax expense in 2017, 2016 and 2015. In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a reduction to income tax expense in the period that such determination is made.

In addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Unrecognized tax benefits for examinations in progress were $487 million, $398 million and $349 million, as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of Tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and totaled $28 million, $18 million and $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Accrued interest and penalties were $423 million, $395 million and $336 million, as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) that instituted fundamental changes to the taxation of multinational corporations. The Tax Act includes changes to the taxation of foreign earnings by implementing a dividend exemption system, expansion of the current anti-deferral rules, a minimum tax on low-taxed foreign earnings and new measures to deter base erosion. The Tax Act also includes a permanent reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21%, repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, expensing of capital investment, and limitation of the deduction for interest expense. Furthermore, as part of the transition to the new tax system, a one-time transition tax is imposed on a U.S. shareholders historical undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates. Although the Tax Act is generally effective January 1, 2018, GAAP requires recognition of the tax effects of new legislation during the reporting period that includes the enactment date, which was December 22, 2017. As a result of the impacts of the Tax Act, the SEC provided guidance that allows the Company to record provisional amounts for those impacts, with the requirement that the accounting be completed in a period not to exceed one year from the date of enactment. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has not completed the accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. Therefore, we have recorded provisional amounts for the effects of the Tax Act. The primary impacts of the Tax Act relate to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the change in the corporate tax rate (Corporate Tax Rate Change); the one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates (Mandatory Transition Tax); and deferred taxes in connection with a change in the Companys intent to permanently reinvest the historical undistributed earnings of its foreign affiliates (Undistributed Foreign Earnings). Corporate Tax Rate Change For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $235 million due to the decrease in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. At the date of enactment, the Company had a deferred tax liability for the excess of its net book value over its tax basis of its U.S. assets and liabilities that will generate future taxable income in excess of book income. Due to the Tax Act, this additional taxable income will be subject to tax at a lower corporate tax rate, consequently reducing the Companys deferred tax liability as of the date of enactment. Mandatory Transition Tax For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provisional tax charge of approximately $1.9 billion due to the imposition of the mandatory transition tax (MTT) on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. The Tax Act imposes a one-time tax on undistributed and previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (EP), as determined in accordance with U.S. tax principles, of certain foreign corporations owned by U.S. shareholders. In general, we have estimated $20 billion of EP related to our foreign affiliates that is subject to the MTT. The MTT is imposed at a rate of 15.5% to the extent of the cash and cash equivalents that are held by the foreign affiliates at certain testing dates; the remaining EP is taxed at a rate of 8.0%. In accordance with the Tax Act, the Company will elect to pay the MTT liability over a period of eight years, with the first installment of $144 million due in 2018; the remainder of the balance is recorded in Other liabilities (noncurrent). As of December 31, 2017, the Company has recorded a provisional amount because certain information related to the computation of EP is not readily available, some of the testing dates to determine taxable amounts have not yet occurred, and there is limited information from federal and state taxing authorities regarding the HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) application and interpretation of the recently enacted legislation. The Company will disclose the impact to the provisional amount in the reporting period in which the accounting is completed, which will not exceed one year from the date of enactment of the Tax Act. Undistributed Foreign Earnings For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provisional tax charge of approximately $2.1 billion due to the Companys intent to no longer permanently reinvest the historical undistributed earnings of its foreign affiliates. We previously considered substantially all of the earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested and, accordingly, recorded no deferred income taxes on such earnings. As a result of the fundamental changes to the taxation of multinational corporations created by the Tax Act, the Company no longer intends to permanently reinvest the historical undistributed earnings of its foreign affiliates, which amounted to approximately $20 billion as of December 31, 2017 (including current year earnings). GAAP requires recognition of a deferred tax liability in the reporting period in which its intent to no longer permanently reinvest its historical undistributed foreign earnings is made. Although no U.S. federal taxes will be imposed on such future distributions of foreign earnings, in many cases the cash transfer will be subject to foreign withholding and other local taxes. Accordingly, at December 31, 2017 the Company has included a provisional deferred tax liability, mostly related to non-U.S. withholding taxes. The Company has recorded a provisional amount because certain information related to the computation of EP, distributable reserves and foreign exchange gains and losses is not readily available. The Company will disclose the impact to the provisional amount in the reporting period in which the accounting is completed, which will not exceed one year from the date of enactment of the Tax Act. The provisional amount is based on the Companys current legal ownership structure which may change in the future. Any future tax impacts resulting from changes to the legal ownership structure will not be considered changes to the provisional amount and will be recorded in the reporting period in which a plan to modify the legal structure is adopted, which may exceed one year from the date of enactment of the Tax Act. Global Intangible Low Taxed Income In addition to the changes described above, the Tax Act imposes a U.S. tax on global intangible low taxed income (GILTI) that is earned by certain foreign affiliates owned by a U.S. shareholder. The computation of GILTI is still subject to interpretation and additional clarifying guidance is expected, but is generally intended to impose tax on the earnings of a foreign corporation that are deemed to exceed a certain threshold return relative to the underlying business investment. In accordance with guidance issued by FASB, the Company has made a policy election to treat future taxes related to GILTI as a current period expense in the reporting period in which the tax is incurred.

Note 14. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Credit and Market Risk Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers. Foreign Currency Risk Management We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. Our primary objective is to preserve the U.S. Dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows and earnings. We attempt to hedge currency exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts (foreign currency exchange contracts) with third parties. We hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in other (income) expense. We partially hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which occur in the next twelve months and are denominated in non-functional currencies, with foreign currency exchange contracts. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. Open foreign currency exchange contracts mature in the next twelve months. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had contracts with notional amounts of $9,273 million and $9,554 million to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S. Dollar, Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi, Indian Rupee, Mexican Peso, and Singapore Dollar. We have also designated foreign currency debt and certain derivative contracts as hedges against portions of our net investment in foreign operations during the year ended December 31, 2017. Gains or losses on the effective portion of the foreign currency debt designated as a net investment hedge are recorded in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. The Company did not have ineffectiveness related to net investment hedges during the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest Rate Risk Management We use a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively changed $2,600 million and $1,850 million of fixed rate debt at rates of 2.93% and 3.39% to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Our interest rate swaps mature at various dates through 2026. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The FASBs accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2017 and 2016: ##TABLE_START        December 31,  2017  2016 Assets:     Foreign currency exchange contracts  $    $   Available for sale investments   3,916    1,670  Interest rate swap agreements   44    69  Liabilities:     Foreign currency exchange contracts  $    $   Interest rate swap agreements   52    48  ##TABLE_END The foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale and are valued using published prices based off observable market data. As such, these investments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds available for sale investments in U.S. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) government and corporate debt securities valued utilizing published prices based on quoted market pricing, which are classified within level 1. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were not carried at fair value: ##TABLE_START            December 31, 2017  December 31, 2016  Carrying Value  Fair Value  Carrying Value  Fair Value Assets         Long-term receivables  $    $    $    $   Liabilities         Long-term debt and related current maturities  $  13,924   $  14,695   $  12,409   $  13,008  ##TABLE_END The Company determined the fair value of the long-term receivables by discounting based upon the terms of the receivable and counterparty details including credit quality. As such, the fair value of these receivables is considered level 2. The Company determined the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities utilizing transactions in the listed markets for identical or similar liabilities. As such, the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities is considered level 2 as well. Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or losses on the derivative recognized in interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt being hedged. Losses on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $29 million and $71 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and were $2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Gains and losses are fully offset by losses and gains on the underlying debt being hedged. We also economically hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts. These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. We recognized $207 million of expense and $232 million of income in Other (income) expense in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We recognized $86 million of expense in Other (income) expense in the year ended December 31, 2015.

Common shareowners are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by the Board of Directors, are entitled to one vote per share, and are entitled, in the event of liquidation, to share ratably in all the assets of Honeywell which are available for distribution to the common shareowners. Common shareowners do not have preemptive or conversion rights. Shares of common stock issued and outstanding or held in the treasury are not liable to further calls or assessments.

In December 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $8 billion of Honeywell common stock, which replaces the previously approved share repurchase program. Approximately $7.7 billion remained available as of December 31, 2017. This authorization included amounts remaining under and replaced the previously approved share repurchase program. Under that previous share repurchase plan announced in April 2016 the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of Honeywell common stock and $4.1 billion remained available as of December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased approximately 20.5 million shares of our common stock for $2,889 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased approximately 19.3 million shares of our common stock for $2,079 million. We are authorized to issue up to 40,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value, and can determine the number of shares of each series, and the rights, preferences and limitations of each series. At December 31, 2017, there was no preferred stock outstanding. Note 17.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans The 2016 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (2016 Plan) and 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc (2016 Directors Plan) were both approved by the shareowners at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners effective on April 25, 2016. Following approval of both plans, we have not and will not grant any new awards under any previously existing stock-based compensation plans. At December 31, 2017, there were 42,025,990, and 924,694 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants under terms of the 2016 Plan and 2016 Directors Plan, respectively. Stock Options The exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under our stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of our stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employees requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock unit (RSU) awards entitle the holder to receive one share of common stock for each unit when the units vest. RSUs are issued to certain key employees and directors as compensation at fair market value at the date of grant.

Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded liabilities for environmental costs: ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2017  2016  2015 Beginning of year  $    $    $   Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable   287    195    194  Environmental liability payments   (212 )    (228 )    (273 )  Other   9    26    6         End of year  $    $    $          ##TABLE_END Environmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts: ##TABLE_START          December 31,    2017  2016 Accrued liabilities  $    $    Other liabilities   369    259         $    $         ##TABLE_END We do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined although they could be material to our consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, NY In 2016, we largely completed a dredging/capping remedy of Onondaga Lake pursuant to a consent decree approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York in January 2007. Some additional long-term monitoring and maintenance activities will continue, as required by the consent decree. Honeywell is also conducting remedial investigations and activities at other sites in Syracuse. We have recorded reserves for these investigations and activities where appropriate, consistent with the accounting policy described above. Honeywell and the federal and New York State natural resource trustees have submitted a consent decree to the federal court requesting approval for a negotiated settlement of natural resource damages claims for this site.

Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix) business, which was sold in 2014, manufactured automotive brake parts that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form.

Both Honeywell and NARCO are protected by a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products to be made against the NARCO Trust. The NARCO Trust reviews submitted claims and determines award amounts in accordance with established Trust Distribution Procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court which set forth the criteria claimants must meet to qualify for compensation including, among other things, exposure and medical criteria that determine the award amount. In addition, Honeywell provided, and continues to provide, input to the design of control procedures for processing NARCO claims, and has on-going audit rights to review and monitor the claims processors adherence to the established requirements of the Trust Distribution Procedures. Honeywell is obligated to fund NARCO asbestos claims submitted to the NARCO Trust which qualify for payment under the Trust Distribution Procedures (Annual Contribution Claims), subject to annual caps of $140 million in 2018 and $145 million for each year thereafter. However, the initial $100 million of claims processed through the NARCO Trust (the Initial Claims Amount) will not count against the annual cap and any unused portion of the Initial Claims Amount will roll over to subsequent years until fully utilized. In 2015, Honeywell filed suit against the NARCO Trust in Bankruptcy Court alleging breach of certain provisions of the Trust Agreement and Trust Distribution Procedures. The parties agreed to dismiss the proceeding without prejudice pursuant to an 18 month Standstill Agreement. Claims processing continued during this period as the parties attempted to resolve disputed issues. The Standstill Agreement expired on October 12, 2017. Notwithstanding its expiration, claims processing continues, and Honeywell continues to negotiate and attempt to resolve remaining disputed issues (that is, instances where Honeywell believes the Trust is not processing claims in accordance with established Trust Distribution Procedures). Honeywell reserves its right to seek judicial intervention should negotiations fail or prove futile. As of December 31, 2017, Honeywell has not made any payments to the NARCO Trust for Annual Contribution Claims. Honeywell is also responsible for payments due to claimants pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and Trust Distribution Procedures criteria (Pre-established Unliquidated Claims), which amounts are estimated at $150 million and are expected to be paid during the initial years of trust operations ($5 million of which has been paid since the effective date of the NARCO Trust). Such payments are not subject to the annual cap described above. Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for Pre-established Unliquidated Claims ($145 million), as well as unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection and operating and legal costs related to the Trust (collectively $19 million) and for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) ($743 million). The estimate of future NARCO claims was prepared in 2002, in the same year NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection, using NARCO tort system litigation experience based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts. Accordingly, the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims was prepared before there was data on claims filings and payment rates in the NARCO Trust under the Trust Distribution Procedures and also prepared when the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims was in effect (which remained in effect until NARCO emerged from Bankruptcy protection). Some critical assumptions underlying this commonly accepted methodology included claims filing rates, disease criteria and payment values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures, estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances. The estimated value of the future NARCO liability reflects claims expected to be asserted against NARCO over a fifteen year period. This projection resulted in a range of estimated liability of $743 million to $961 million. We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. Given the Trusts lack of sufficient claims processing experience since NARCO emerged from bankruptcy protection, it is not yet possible to reliably estimate future claim costs based on actual Trust experience. Our insurance receivable corresponding to the estimated liability for pending and future NARCO asbestos claims reflects coverage which reimburses Honeywell for portions of NARCO-related indemnity and defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. We conduct analyses to estimate the probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos claims. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. We made judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the NARCO-related asbestos liabilities or assets to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. Given the uncertainties, we review our estimates periodically, and update them based on our experience and other relevant factors. Similarly, we will reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability or other developments that may impact insurance recoveries.

Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of pending (claims actually filed as of the financial statement date) and future Bendix-related asbestos claims. We have valued Bendix pending and future claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix pending and future claims during the fourth quarter each year. The liability for future claims represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury claims expected to be asserted against Bendix over the next five years. Such estimated cost of future Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. The methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims is similar to that used to estimate the liability for future NARCO-related asbestos claims. Our insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of pending and future Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the solvency of our insurers, judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with our insurers. Honeywell believes it has sufficient insurance coverage and reserves to cover all pending Bendix-related asbestos claims and Bendix-related asbestos claims estimated to be filed within the next five years. Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of either pending or future Bendix-related asbestos claims, we do not believe that such claims would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position in light of our insurance coverage and our prior experience in resolving such claims. If the rate and types of claims filed, the average resolution value of such claims and the period of time over which claim settlements are paid (collectively, the Variable Claims Factors) do not substantially change, Honeywell would not expect future Bendix-related asbestos claims to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in any fiscal year. No assurances can be given, however, that the Variable Claims Factors will not change. Other Matters We are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Included in these other matters are the following: Honeywell v. United Auto Workers (UAW) et. al In September 2011, the UAW and certain Honeywell retirees filed a suit in the Eastern District of Michigan alleging that the Master Collective Bargaining Agreements (MCBAs) between Honeywell and the UAW do not provide for limitations on Honeywells obligation to contribute toward healthcare coverage for former employees who retired under the MCBAs (CAPS). Honeywell subsequently answered the UAWs complaint and asserted counterclaims. Honeywell began enforcing the CAPS against former employees who retired after the initial inclusion of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA (the post-2003 retirees) on January 1, 2014. The UAW and certain of the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment with respect to the post-2003 retirees, seeking a ruling that the 2003 MCBA did not limit Honeywells obligation to contribute to healthcare coverage for those retirees. That motion remains pending. Honeywell is confident that the District Court will find that the 2003 MCBA does, in fact, limit Honeywells retiree healthcare obligation for the post-2003 retirees. In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywells other postretirement benefits for post-2003 retirees would increase by approximately $79 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS. In the second quarter of 2014, the parties agreed to stay the proceedings with respect to former employees who retired before the initial inclusion of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA (the pre-2003 retirees) until the Supreme Court decided MG Polymers USA, LLC v. Tackett . The Supreme Court decided the case on January 26, 2015 and, based on the ruling, Honeywell began enforcing the CAPS against the pre-2003 retirees on May 1, 2015. Honeywell is confident that the CAPS will be upheld by the District Court and that its liability for healthcare coverage premiums with respect to the putative class will be limited as negotiated and expressly set forth in the applicable MCBAs. In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywells other postretirement benefits for pre-2003 retirees would increase by approximately $103 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS. Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations (including the specific matter referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above). Considering our past experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. Warranties and Guarantees In the normal course of business we issue product warranties and product performance guarantees. We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale. Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties and guarantees are made as changes to the obligations become reasonably estimable. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywells U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywells U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywells U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Rate was changed to 3.60% for the remainder of 2017 due to Plan remeasurement as of 3/1/17. ##TABLE_END The discount rate for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefits plans reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be settled at the measurement date of December 31. To determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments. We use the single HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations. During the fourth quarter of 2015 we changed the methodology used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit (income) cost for our significant pension plans. Previously, we estimated such cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the pension benefit obligation. The new methodology utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these cost components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. The change did not affect the measurement of our pension obligation and was applied prospectively as a change in estimate. For our U.S. pension plans, the single weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2018 are 3.77% and 3.27%. Our expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 7.75% is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations. We review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. For non-U.S. benefit plans actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country. Pension Benefits The following amounts relate to our significant pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets. ##TABLE_START            December 31,  U.S. Plans  Non-U.S. Plans  2017  2016  2017  2016 Projected benefit obligation  $    $  17,414   $  1,082   $  2,294  Accumulated benefit obligation  $    $  17,263   $  1,018   $  2,220  Fair value of plan assets      $  16,814   $    $  1,552  ##TABLE_END Accumulated benefit obligation for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $18.1 billion and $17.3 billion and for our Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $6.9 billion and $6.4 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016. Our asset investment strategy for our U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve our long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. Our actual invested positions in various securities change over time based on short and longer-term investment opportunities. To achieve our objectives, we have established long-term target allocations as follows: 60%-70% equity securities, 10%-20% fixed income securities and cash, 5%-15% real estate investments, and 10%-20% other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located both inside and outside the United States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies. We review our assets on a regular basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations. Our non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing funding and investment guidance. Our non-U.S. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Sufficient cash or cash equivalents are held by our pension plans to cover the notional value of the futures contracts. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, our U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $4,188 million and $3,775 million. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, our non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $133 million and $55 million. In both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is primarily related to outstanding equity futures contracts. Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgages, asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in collective trust funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals. Our general funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2017, 2016, and 2015, we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made. We are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2018. In 2017, contributions of $136 million were made to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. In 2018, we expect to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $142 million to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Contributions for both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets. Benefit payments, including amounts to be paid from Company assets, and reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows: ##TABLE_START        U.S. Plans  Non-U.S. Plans  $  1,170   $   2019   1,159    256  2020   1,165    264  2021   1,169    271  2022   1,176    289  2023-2027   5,795    1,477  ##TABLE_END Other Postretirement Benefits ##TABLE_START        December 31,  2017  2016 Assumed health care cost trend rate:     Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year   6.50 %    6.50 %  Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to   5.00 %    5.00 %  Year that the rate reaches the rate it is assumed to remain at   2023    2023  ##TABLE_END The assumed health care cost trend rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported.

Segment Financial Data We globally manage our business operations through four reportable operating segments. Segment information is consistent with how management reviews the businesses, makes investing and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance. Honeywells senior management evaluates segment performance based on segment profit. Segment profit is measured as segment income (loss) before taxes excluding general corporate unallocated expense, other income (expense), interest and other financial charges, stock compensation expenses, pension and other postretirement benefits (expense), stock compensation expense and repositioning and other charges. Effective October 2017, the Company realigned the Smart Energy business, previously part of the Home and Building Technologies segment, into the Process Solutions business within the Performance Materials and Technologies segment. Effective July 2016, the Company realigned the business units comprising its Automation and Control Solutions reporting segment by forming two new reportable operating segments: Home and Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions. These realignments have no impact on the Companys historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period segment presentation. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Honeywell International Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP Parsippany, New Jersey February 9, 2018 We have served as the Companys auditor since 2014. ", "9A": " Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Honeywell management maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There have been no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Honeywells internal control over financial reporting that have occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) at December 31, 2017. Based on these evaluations, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 were effective as of December 31, 2017. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Honeywell management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Honeywells internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management assessed the effectiveness of Honeywells internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment, management determined that Honeywell maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. The effectiveness of Honeywells internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by Deloitte  Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8.

RSUs included in column (a) of the table represent the full number of RSUs awarded and outstanding whereas the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon vesting will be lower than what is reflected on the table because the value of shares required to meet employee tax withholding requirements are not issued.    1,398,906 growth plan units were issued and remain outstanding for the performance cycle commencing January 1, 2016 and ended December 31, 2017 pursuant to the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan. The value of this growth plan award will be paid in cash and, thus, growth plan units are not included in the table above.    Because the number of future shares that may be distributed to employees participating in the Honeywell Global Stock Plan is unknown, no shares attributable to that plan are included in column (a) of the table above.  (2)  Column (b) relates to stock options and does not include any exercise price for RSUs because an RSUs value is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals or continued employment or service and they are settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis.  (3)  The number of shares that may be issued under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2017 is 42,025,990 which includes the following additional shares that may again be available for issuance: shares that are settled for cash, expire, are canceled, or under similar prior plans, are tendered as option exercise price or tax withholding obligations, are reacquired with cash option exercise price or with monies attributable to any tax deduction to Honeywell upon the exercise of an option, or are under any outstanding awards assumed under any equity compensation plan of ##TABLE_END 92 ##TABLE_START    an entity acquired by Honeywell. No securities are available for future issuance under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan or the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan.    The number of shares that may be issued under the Honeywell Global Stock Plan as of December 31, 2017 is 1,854,517. This plan is an umbrella plan for three plans described below maintained solely for eligible employees of participating non-U.S. countries. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The UK Sharebuilder Plan allows an eligible UK employee to invest taxable earnings in Common Stock. The Company matches those shares and dividends paid are used to purchase additional shares of Common Stock. For the year ending December 31, 2017, 46,573 shares were credited to participants accounts under the UK Sharebuilder Plan.    The Honeywell International Technologies Employees Share Ownership Plan (Ireland) and the Honeywell Measurex (Ireland) Limited Group Employee Profit Sharing Scheme, allow eligible employees in Ireland to contribute specified percentages of base pay, bonus or performance pay that are then invested in Common Stock. For the year ending December 31, 2017, 5,887 shares of Common Stock were credited to participants accounts under these two plans. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The remaining 924,694 shares included in column (c) are shares remaining under the 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors.  (4)  Equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners included in the table refers to the Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees.    The Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees is an unfunded, non-tax qualified plan that provides benefits equal to the employee deferrals and company matching allocations that would have been provided under Honeywells U.S. tax-qualified savings plan if the Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and contributions did not apply. The Company matching contribution is credited to participants accounts in the form of notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of Common Stock. The number of shares to be issued under this plan based on the value of the notional shares as of December 31, 2017 is 399,676.    The AlliedSignal Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Employees was a cash incentive compensation plan maintained by AlliedSignal Inc. This plan has expired. Employees were permitted to defer receipt of a cash bonus payable under the plan and invest the deferred bonus in notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock that remain to be issued as of December 31, 2017 is 4,372.  (5)  Column (b) does not include any exercise price for notional shares allocated to employees under Honeywells equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners because all of these shares are only settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis.  (6)  The amount of securities available for future issuance under the Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees is not determinable because the number of securities that may be issued under this plan depends upon the amount deferred to the plan by participants in future years. ##TABLE_END ", "13": " Item 13.

Major Businesses On October 1, 2018, the Company completed the spin-off of its Transportation Systems business, formerly part of Aerospace, and on October 29, 2018, the Company completed the spin-off of its Homes and Global Distribution business, formerly part of Home and Building Technologies. Therefore, as of the end of 2018, those businesses were no longer part of the Company. Following the spin-off of the Homes and Global Distribution business, the Home and Building Technologies segment was renamed Honeywell Building Technologies. The major products/services, customers/uses and key competitors of each of our segments are: Aerospace Aerospace is a leading global supplier of products, software and services for aircrafts that it sells to original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and other customers in a variety of end markets including: air transport, regional, business and general aviation aircraft, airlines, aircraft operators and defense and space contractors.

Competition We are subject to competition in substantially all product and service areas. Some of our key competitors are: ##TABLE_START    Aerospace: Garmin, Thales, Safran and United Technologies    Honeywell Building Technologies: Emerson Electric, Itron, Johnson Controls, Schneider Electric and Siemens    Performance Materials and Technologies: Albemarle, BASF, DowDupont, Emerson Electric and Sinopec    Safety and Productivity Solutions: 3M, Mine Safety Appliances (MSA), Kion Group, TE Connectivity and Zebra Technologies ##TABLE_END Our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of OEMs. Aerospace Sales Our Aerospace segment sales were 37%, 36% and 38% of our total sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our sales to commercial aerospace OEMs were 7%, 6% and 6% of our total sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016. In addition, our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 13%, 13% and 12% of our total sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016. U.S. Government Sales Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by Aerospace), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $3,403 million, $3,203 million and $3,330 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a prime contractor and subcontractor, of $2,832 million, $2,546 million and $2,647 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016. We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2019 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEMs production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs), as well as our diversified commercial businesses. Backlog Our backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts. Starting in 2018 following the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under the contracts that meet the new guidance on revenue from contracts with customers as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog was $24,850 million and $17,690 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017. We expect to recognize approximately 56% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in 2019, and the remaining balance thereafter. International Operations We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development (RD) globally. U.S. exports and non-U.S. manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 13% of our total sales in 2018, 12% in 2017 and 13% in 2016. Non-U.S. manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 43% of our total sales in 2018, 44% in 2017 and 43% in 2016. ##TABLE_START          Manufactured Products and Systems and Performance of Services  Year Ended December 31, 2018  Aerospace  Honeywell Building Technologies  Performance Materials and Technologies  Safety and Productivity Solutions   (% of Segment Sales) U.S. Exports   21 %    1 %    16 %    3 %  Non-U.S.   31 %    52 %    55 %    40 %  ##TABLE_END Information related to risks attendant to our foreign operations is included in Item 1A. Risk Factors under the caption Macroeconomic and Industry Risks. Raw Materials The principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available. Although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply, we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2018. We are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials. The costs of certain key raw materials, including R240, copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, and perchloroethylene in Performance Materials and Technologies and nickel, steel, titanium and other metals in Aerospace, are expected to continue to fluctuate. We will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2019. Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business. Environment We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacturing, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is also possible that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys National Priority List. Although there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we do not anticipate having to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole. We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Companys business or markets that it serves, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures, earnings, competitive position or financial standing. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. Employees We have approximately 114,000 employees at December 31, 2018, of whom approximately 44,000 are located in the United States. Executive Officers of the Registrant The executive officers of Honeywell, listed as follows, are elected annually by the Board of Directors.

Risk Factors Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements We describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in other parts of this report (including this Item 1A). Such discussions contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Risk Factors Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Macroeconomic and Industry Risks Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations. ##TABLE_START    Aerospace Operating results of Aerospace are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, as well as changes in customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. The operating results of our Commercial Aviation business unit may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and global flying hours, which impact air transport, regional, business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as, new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain.    Honeywell Building Technologies Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global commercial construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects, less industrial plant expansion, changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels.    Performance Materials and Technologies Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply volatility, product commoditization, and our ability to maximize our facilities production capacity and minimize downtime. In particular, the volatility in oil and natural gas prices have and will continue to impact our customers operating levels and capital spending and thus demand for our products and services.    Safety and Productivity Solutions Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global capital spending and operating expenditures, including in the oil and gas industry, reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives, fluctuations in retail markets, lower customer demand due to the failure to anticipate and respond to overall trends related to end market demand, changes in the ##TABLE_END 6 ##TABLE_START    competitive landscape including new market entrants and technology that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices and lower margins. ##TABLE_END An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations. Our international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Companys sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes), violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate these risks), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory and economic landscape, the potential for changes in global trade policies including sanctions and trade barriers, trends such as populism, economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies, and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. While it is currently not known what the final outcome and full terms of the United Kingdoms future relationship with the European Union will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States, increased tariffs on U.K. imports and exports, and increased regulatory complexities. Existing free trade laws and regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, or any successor agreement, provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results. Operating outside of the United States also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss. Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. Operational Risks Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities. The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in Performance Materials and Technologies (R240, copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, and perchloroethylene) and in Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations. Many major components, product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, and during integration we may discover cybersecurity and compliance issues. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification and (v) the inability to collect on the indemnification and reimbursement agreements entered into with our spin-offs, Garrett Motion Inc. and Resideo Technologies, Inc. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins. Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors including many new and non-traditional competitors, (iv) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (v) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively, (vi) monitor disruptive technologies and business models, (vii) achieve sufficient return on investment for new products introduced based on capital expenditures and research and development spending, (viii) respond to changes in overall trends related to end market demand, and (x) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. Competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses. Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, increased attrition, failure to create and implement a succession plan for key Company positions, not retaining key talent, inability to attract new employees with unique skills, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations. As a supplier to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unique risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future. We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment, or the use of or communications respecting certain materials in our products, and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require injunctive relief measures, including installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, or limiting access of our products to markets, among others. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third party service providers, including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. Data privacy, identity protection, and information security may require significant resources and presents certain risks. We collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect such data, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, or employee errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure. For example, the State of California recently passed legislation granting residents certain new data privacy rights and regulating the security of Internet of Things devices, which will go into effect in January 2020; European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe; the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect in May 2018, superseded prior European Union data protection legislation and imposes more stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance; and several other countries have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. A material disruption of our operations, particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our information technology infrastructure, could adversely affect our business. Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters including hurricanes and floods, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, equipment failures, sabotage, adverse weather conditions, public health crises, labor disputes, critical supply failure, inaccurate downtime forecast, political disruption, and other reasons, which can result in undesirable consequences, including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers. We employ information technology systems and networks to support the business and rely on them to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Disruptions to our information technology infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, and other events, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server, systems and other third party IT service providers, could interfere with our operations, interrupt production and shipments, damage customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact our reputation. Legal and Regulatory Risks Our U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), potential expansion of taxation on digital services, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. tax reform legislation as well as multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), will increase tax uncertainty and impact our provision for income taxes. Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety, performance and product certification regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial Aftermarket may be impacted by, among other things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations. Within Honeywell Building Technologies, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies results of operations can be impacted by environmental standards, regulations, and judicial determinations . Growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive. Noncompliance with legislation and regulations can result in fines and penalties. Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate even more restrictive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions, than the voluntary commitments that the Company has made or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, they could negatively impact the Companys business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, accounting, import and export, and environmental, health and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.

Dividend information for Honeywells common stock is included in Note 25 Unaudited Quarterly Financial Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The number of record holders of our common stock at December 31, 2018 was 45,606. Information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included in Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters under the caption Equity Compensation Plans. Honeywell purchased 11,181,042 shares of its common stock, par value $1 per share, in the quarter ending December 31, 2018. In December 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $8 billion of Honeywell common stock, which included amounts remaining under and replaced the previously approved share repurchase program. $3.7 billion remained available as of as of December 31, 2018 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of our operating, financing and other investing activities. The following table summarizes Honeywells purchase of its common stock for the three months ended December 31, 2018: ##TABLE_START          Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Period  Total Number of Shares Purchased  Average Price Paid per Share  Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs  Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet be Purchased Under Plans or Programs (Dollars in millions) October 2018   5,360,640   $  156.75    5,360,640   $  4,589  November 2018   4,810,000   $  146.77    4,810,000   $  3,883  December 2018   1,010,402   $  143.62    1,010,402   $  3,737  ##TABLE_END 14 Performance Graph The following graph compares the five-year cumulative total return on our common stock to the total returns on the Standard  Poors (SP) 500 Stock Index and a composite of SPs Industrial Conglomerates and Aerospace and Defense indices, on a 65%/35% weighted basis (the Composite Index). The weighting of the components of the Composite Index are based on our segments relative contribution to total segment profit. The selection of the Industrial Conglomerates component of the Composite Index reflects the diverse and distinct range of non-aerospace businesses conducted by Honeywell.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY During 2018, Honeywell continued to deliver on our financial commitments and to create long-term shareowner value. We grew net sales 3% to $41,802 million and grew income before taxes 8% to $7,487 million. The improvement in year over year income before taxes was attributable to both sales growth as well as operational improvements that increased operating margins. We believe our ability to consistently grow earnings derives from the consistent, rigorous deployment of the Honeywell Operating System as well as a long history of identifying and investing in productivity initiatives. We have continued our focus on commercial excellence processes, such as Velocity Product Development (VPD), to drive higher sales at better margins. We are careful not to allow the attainment of short-term financial results to imperil the creation of long-term, sustainable shareowner value. Hence, as part of the announcement in October 2017 of the results of our portfolio review, we affirmed our commitment to a strategy and investments that are intended to enable us to become one of the worlds leading software industrial companies. Our refocused strategy and investments are intended to take better advantage of our core technological and software strengths in high growth businesses that participate in six attractive industrial end markets. Each of these end markets is characterized by favorable global mega-trends including energy efficiency, infrastructure investment, urbanization and safety. In 2018 we deployed capital of $7.6 billion, including the following: ##TABLE_START    Capital Investment we invested over $0.8 billion in capital expenditures focused on high return projects.    Dividends In 2018, we paid cash dividends of $2.3 billion and increased our annual dividend rate by 10%, as we seek to continue to grow the dividend in line with earnings. The dividend increase in September 2018 marked the ninth consecutive double-digit increase since 2010.    Share Repurchases we continue to repurchase our shares with the goal of keeping share count flat and by offsetting the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation and savings plans. Additionally, we seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. In 2018, we repurchased 26.5 million shares for $4.0 billion.    Mergers and Acquisitions we deployed approximately $0.5 billion during 2018 on acquisitions. ##TABLE_END CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales ##TABLE_START          2018  2017  2016 Net sales  $  41,802   $  40,534   $  39,302  % change compared with prior period   3 %    3 %    ##TABLE_END The change in net sales is attributable to the following: ##TABLE_START        2018 Versus 2017  2017 Versus 2016 Volume   4%    3%  Price   2%    1%  Acquisitions/Divestitures   (4)%    (1)%  Foreign Currency Translation   1%    0%         3%    3%       ##TABLE_END A discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. The foreign currency translation impact in 2018 compared with 2017 was principally driven by the strengthening on average year over year of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar. The foreign currency translation impact in 2017 compared with 2016 was flat. The strengthening of the Euro was offset by the weakening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar. Cost of Products and Services Sold ##TABLE_START          2018  2017  2016 Cost of products and services sold  $  29,046   $  28,144   $  27,677  % change compared with prior period   3 %    2 %          Gross Margin percentage   30.5 %    30.6 %    29.6 %  ##TABLE_END Cost of products and services sold increased in 2018 compared with 2017 principally due to increased direct material costs of approximately $790 million (driven by higher sales volume and inflation partially offset by divestitures and productivity) and higher repositioning and other charges of approximately $70 million. Gross margin percentage decreased in 2018 compared with 2017 principally due to higher repositioning and other charges (approximately 0.2 percentage point impact) partially offset by higher gross margin in the segments (approximately 0.1 percentage point impact collectively). Cost of products and services sold increased in 2017 compared with 2016 principally due to increased direct material costs of approximately $290 million (driven by higher sales volume and acquisitions partially offset by divestitures and productivity, net of inflation), higher repositioning and other charges of approximately $220 million and higher depreciation and amortization of approximately $90 million, partially offset by decreased indirect material costs of approximately $70 million and lower labor costs of approximately $60 million. Gross margin percentage increased in 2017 compared with 2016 principally due to higher gross margin in Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies (approximately 1.7 percentage point impact collectively), partially offset by higher repositioning and other charges (approximately 0.5 percentage point impact) and by lower gross margin in Home and Building Solutions and Safety and Productivity Solutions (approximately 0.3 percentage point impact collectively). Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ##TABLE_START          2018  2017  2016 Selling, general and administrative expenses  $  6,051   $  6,087   $  5,574  % of sales   14.5 %    15.0 %    14.2 %  ##TABLE_END Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to productivity and divestiture impacts, partially offset by labor inflation and higher repositioning charges. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to increased labor costs (driven primarily by acquisitions, net of divestitures, investment for growth and merit increases), and higher repositioning charges. Other (Income) Expense ##TABLE_START          2018  2017  2016 Other (income) expense  $  (1,149 )   $  (963 )   $  (739 )  ##TABLE_END Other (income) expense increased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to an increase in pension ongoing incomenon-service, favorable impacts of foreign currency and an increase in interest income, partially offset by separation costs associated with the spin-offs of our Homes and Global Distribution business and Transportation Systems business. Other (income) expense increased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to due to an increase in pension ongoing incomenon-service. Tax Expense ##TABLE_START          2018  2017  2016 Tax expense  $    $  5,362   $  1,603  Effective tax rate   8.8 %    77.2 %    24.8 %  ##TABLE_END The effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily attributable to internal restructuring initiatives that resulted in a reduction of accrued withholding taxes of approximately $1.1 billion related to unremitted foreign earnings. In addition, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $440 million as a reduction to our 2017 provisional estimate of impacts from what is commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Reform), which was partially offset by $411 million of tax costs associated with the internal restructuring of the Homes and Global Distribution business and the Transportation Systems business in advance of their spin-offs. The effective tax rate for 2017 was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily from the estimated impacts of U.S. Tax Reform of approximately $3.8 billion, partially offset by lower tax rates on non-U.S. earnings. The effective tax rate for 2016 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily from lower tax rates on non-U.S. earnings. For further discussion of changes in the effective tax rate, see Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Income Attributable to Honeywell ##TABLE_START          2018  2017  2016 Net income attributable to Honeywell  $  6,765   $  1,545   $  4,812  Earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution  $  8.98   $  2.00   $  6.21  ##TABLE_END Earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution increased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily driven by the lower income tax expenses (due to reduction of accrued withholding taxes and the higher comparative income taxes in 2017 from U.S. Tax Reform), higher segment profit, increased pension and other postretirement income, and lower share count, partially offset by separation costs and higher repositioning and other charges. Earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily driven by additional income tax expense from U.S. Tax Reform, higher repositioning and other charges, partially offset by higher segment profit across all segments, lower pension mark-to-market expense and increased pension and other postretirement income. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Our consolidated results are principally impacted by: ##TABLE_START    Changes in global economic growth rates and industry conditions and demand in our key end markets;    The impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (in particular the Euro), relative to the U.S. Dollar;    The extent to which cost savings from productivity actions are able to offset or exceed the impact of material and non-material inflation;    The spin-offs of the Homes and Global Distribution business and the Transportation Systems business into two stand-alone, publicly-traded companies and the associated separation costs;    The impact of the pension discount rate and asset returns on pension expense, including mark-to-market adjustments, and funding requirements; and    The impact of U.S. Tax Reform. ##TABLE_END Our 2019 areas of focus, most of which are applicable to each of our segments include: ##TABLE_START    Driving profitable growth through research and development and technological excellence to deliver innovative products that customers value, and through expansion and localization of our footprint in high growth regions;    Executing on our strategy to become a software-industrial company, which for us means products and services that facilitate the connected plane, building and factory;    Expanding margins by optimizing the Companys cost structure through manufacturing and administrative process improvements, repositioning, and other productivity actions;    Executing disciplined, rigorous MA and integration processes to deliver growth through acquisitions;    Controlling corporate costs, including costs incurred for asbestos and environmental matters, pension and other post-retirement benefits; and    Increasing availability of capital through strong cash flow conversion from effective working capital management and proactively managing debt levels to enable the Company to smartly deploy capital for strategic acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases and capital expenditures. ##TABLE_END 20 Review of Business Segments ##TABLE_START              Years Ended December 31,  % Change  2018 Versus 2017  2017 Versus 2016  2018  2017  2016 Aerospace Sales           Commercial Aviation Original Equipment  $  2,833   $  2,475   $  2,525    14 %    (2 )%  Commercial Aviation Aftermarket   5,373    5,103    4,796    5 %    6 %  Defense and Space   4,665    4,053    4,375    15 %    (7 )%  Transportation Systems   2,622    3,148    3,055    (17 )%    3 %         Total Aerospace Sales   15,493    14,779    14,751      Honeywell Building Technologies Sales           Homes   3,928    4,482    4,405    (12 )%    2 %  Buildings   5,370    5,295    5,085    1 %    4 %         Total Honeywell Building Technologies Sales   9,298    9,777    9,490      Performance Materials and Technologies Sales           UOP   2,845    2,753    2,469    3 %    12 %  Process Solutions   4,981    4,795    4,640    4 %    3 %  Advanced Materials   2,848    2,791    3,327    2 %    (16 )%         Total Performance Materials and Technologies Sales   10,674    10,339    10,436      Safety and Productivity Solutions Sales           Safety   2,278    2,169    2,075    5 %    5 %  Productivity Solutions   4,059    3,470    2,550    17 %    36 %         Total Safety and Productivity Solutions Sales   6,337    5,639    4,625             Net Sales  $  41,802   $  40,534   $  39,302             ##TABLE_END Aerospace ##TABLE_START              2018  2017  Change  2016  Change Net sales  $  15,493   $  14,779    5 %   $  14,751      Cost of products and services sold   10,837    10,320      10,820    Selling, general and administrative and other expenses   1,153    1,171      940             Segment profit  $  3,503   $  3,288    7 %   $  2,991    10 %           ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START          Factors Contributing to Year-Over-Year Change  2018 vs. 2017  2017 vs. 2016  Sales  Segment Profit  Sales  Segment Profit Organic growth/ Operational segment profit   9 %    9 %    2 %    11 %  Foreign currency translation   1 %    1 %          Acquisitions, divestitures and other, net   (5 )%    (3 )%    (2 )%    (1 )%           Total % Change   5 %    7 %        10 %           ##TABLE_END 2018 compared with 2017 Aerospace sales increased due to organic sales growth, due to both volume and price, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard (included within Acquisitions, divestitures and other, net in the table above), offset by the spin-off of the Transportation Systems business on October 1, 2018. ##TABLE_START    Commercial Original Equipment sales increased 14% (increased 11% organic) primarily due to increased demand from business aviation, and air transport and regional original equipment manufacturers (OEM), lower OEM incentives and the impact from the classification of nonrecurring engineering and development funding resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard.    Commercial Aftermarket sales increased 5% (increased 5% organic) primarily due to growth in business aviation and air transport and regional.    Defense and Space sales increased 15% (increased 15% organic) primarily driven by growth in U.S. and international defense.    Transportation Systems sales decreased 17% driven by divestiture impacts following its October 1, 2018 spin-off.

Sales in Productivity Solutions increased 17% (increased 16% organic) primarily due to increased sales volume in Intelligrated, Sensing and IoT, and Productivity Products. ##TABLE_END Safety and Productivity Solutions segment profit increased primarily due to an increase in operational segment profit. The increase in operational segment profit was driven by higher sales volume and price. Cost of products and services increased primarily due to higher organic sales. 2017 compared with 2016 Safety and Productivity Solutions sales increased primarily due to acquisitions and organic sales volume. ##TABLE_START    Sales in Safety increased 5% (increased 4% organic) due to increased sales volume in the Industrial Safety business, higher distribution in the Retail business, and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.    Sales in Productivity Solutions increased 36% (increased 6% organic) principally due to growth from acquisitions (Intelligrated was acquired in August 2016). ##TABLE_END Safety and Productivity Solutions segment profit increased due to an increase from operational segment profit and acquisitions. The increase in operational segment profit is driven by higher productivity, net of inflation, and sales volume. Cost of products and services increased primarily due to acquisitions and higher sales volume offset by productivity, net of inflation. Repositioning Charges See Note 3 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Cash spending related to our repositioning actions was $285 million, $177 million and $228 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, and was funded through operating cash flows. In 2019, we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately $300 million and to be funded through operating cash flows. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, access to the public debt and equity markets and the ability to access non-U.S. cash as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform. We continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. Cash Flow Summary Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows: ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2018  2017  2016 Cash provided by (used for):       Operating activities  $  6,434   $  5,966   $  5,498  Investing activities   1,027    (3,574 )    (3,342 )  Financing activities   (5,032 )    (3,516 )    346  Effect of exchange rate changes on cash   (201 )    340    (114 )         Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents  $  2,228   $  (784 )   $  2,388         ##TABLE_END 2018 compared with 2017 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $468 million primarily due to a $239 million increase in customer advances and deferred income and lower cash tax payments of $185 million. Cash provided by investing activities increased by $4,601 million primarily due to a net $4,302 million decrease in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities, and a $620 million favorable change in settlements of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $453 million. Cash used for financing activities increased by $1,516 million primarily due to an increase in net debt payments of $2,622 million, an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $1,364 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of $153 million, partially offset by net spin separation funding of $2,622 million net of spin-off cash. 2017 compared with 2016 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $468 million primarily due to a $504 million increase in segment profit and a $294 million favorable impact from working capital (favorable accounts payable partially offset by inventory and accounts receivable), partially offset by higher cash tax payments of $609 million. Cash used for investing activities increased by $232 million primarily due to (i) a net $2,056 million increase in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities, (ii) an increase of $500 million of settlement payments of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and (iii) a decrease in proceeds from the sales of businesses of $296 million (most significantly Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. in 2016), partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $2,491 million (most significantly Intelligrated in 2016). Cash provided by financing activities increased by $3,862 million primarily due to a decrease in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $2,827 million, an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $699 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of $204 million. Liquidity Each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. Considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies, including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity. In addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. To date, the Company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity. We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. A source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount or premium and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings and commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2018 was (0.31%) and as of December 31, 2017 was (0.17%). Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2018, Standard and Poors (SP), Fitch, and Moodys have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1. SP, Fitch and Moodys have Honeywells rating outlook as stable. We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 13 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity. In 2018, the Company repurchased $4,000 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans, and to reduce share count when attractive opportunities arise. In December 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $8 billion of Honeywell common stock, of which $3.7 billion remained available as of December 31, 2018 for additional share repurchases. This authorization included amounts remaining under and replaced the previously approved share repurchase program. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. We will continue to seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, strategic acquisitions and debt repayments. Specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2019 to be as follows: ##TABLE_START    Capital expenditureswe expect to spend approximately $800 million for capital expenditures in 2019 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement. ##TABLE_END 27 ##TABLE_START    Share repurchasesunder the Companys share repurchase program, $3.7 billion is available as of December 31, 2018 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we will seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities.    Dividendswe increased our quarterly dividend rate by 10% to $0.82 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2018 dividend. The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2019. ##TABLE_END We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2018, we realized $2,622 million in net cash proceeds from the spin-off of non-strategic businesses. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines and access to the public debt and equity markets, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. Contractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments Following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2018: ##TABLE_START              Total (6)(7)  Payments by Period  Thereafter  2019  2020- 2021  2022- 2023 Long-term debt, including capitalized leases (1)  $  12,628   $  2,872   $  3,761   $  1,778   $  4,217  Interest payments on long-term debt, including capitalized leases   3,049    313    519    389    1,828  Minimum operating lease payments   856    210    310    189    147  Purchase obligations (2)   2,002    1,146    578    250    28  Estimated environmental liability payments (3)   755    175    355    172    53  Asbestos related liability payments (4)   2,514    245    786    710    773  Asbestos insurance recoveries (5)   (477 )    (40 )    (114 )    (84 )    (239 )               $  21,327   $  4,921   $  6,195   $  3,404   $  6,807             ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  (1)  Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity.  (2)  Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements.  (3)  The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2018.  (4)  These amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2018. See Asbestos Matters in Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. ##TABLE_END 28 ##TABLE_START  (5)  These amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos related liabilities as of December 31, 2018. See Asbestos Matters in Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  (6)  The table excludes tax liability payments, including those for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  (7)  The table excludes expected proceeds from the indemnification and reimbursement agreements entered into with Garrett and Resideo. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. ##TABLE_END Environmental Matters Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $395 million, $287 million and $195 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016. In addition, in 2018, 2017 and 2016 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $95 million, $82 million and $83 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations. Spending related to known environmental matters was $218 million, $212 million and $228 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016 and is estimated to be approximately $175 million in 2019. We expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties. Reimbursements from Resideo for spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the indemnification and reimbursement agreement was $25 million in 2018 and is expected to be $140 million in 2019. Such reimbursements will offset operating cash outflows incurred by the Company. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our environmental matters and the indemnification and reimbursement agreement entered into with Resideo. Financial Instruments The following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at December 31, 2018 and 2017. ##TABLE_START            Face or Notional Amount  Carrying Value (1)  Fair Value (1)  Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value (2) December 31, 2018         Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments         Long-term debt (including current maturities)  $  12,628   $  (12,628 )   $  (13,133 )   $  (654 )  Interest rate swap agreements   2,600    (45 )    (45 )    (83 )  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments         Foreign currency exchange contracts (3)   14,995    115    115    (742 )  Cross currency swap agreements   1,200    32    32    (117 )  December 31, 2017         Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments         Long-term debt (including current maturities)  $  13,924   $  (13,924 )   $  (14,695 )   $  (782 )  Interest rate swap agreements   2,600    (8 )    (8 )    (233 )  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments         Foreign currency exchange contracts (3)   9,273    (53 )    (53 )    (58 )  ##TABLE_END 29 ##TABLE_START  (1)  Asset or (liability).  (2)  A hypothetical immediate one percentage point decrease in interest rates across all maturities and a potential change in fair value of foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities will result in a change in fair value approximately equal to the inverse of the amount disclosed in the table.  (3)  Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value, cash flows, or net investments of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions or foreign operations. ##TABLE_END See Note 15 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the agreements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Contingent Liabilities We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, legal and environmental, health and safety matters. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a thorough analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies. Asbestos Related Liabilities and Insurance Recoveries, and Indemnification Receivables Honeywells involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust. The estimate of future NARCO claims was prepared in 2002, in the same year NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection, using NARCO tort system litigation experience based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts. Accordingly, the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims was prepared before there was data on claims filings and payment rates in the NARCO Trust under the Trust Distribution Procedures and prepared when the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims was in effect (which remained in effect until NARCO emerged from Bankruptcy protection). Some critical assumptions underlying this commonly accepted methodology included claims filing rates, disease criteria and payment values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures, estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances. This estimate resulted in a range of estimated liability of $743 million to $961 million. We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. Given the Trusts lack of sufficiently reliable claims data since NARCO emerged from bankruptcy protection, it is not yet possible to update our estimated future claim costs based on actual NARCO Trust experience. Regarding Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix) asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future claims related to Bendix over the full term of epidemiological projections through 2059 based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries considering any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. Additionally, in conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Garrett subsidiary, pursuant to which Garretts subsidiary has an obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell as reimbursement for asbestos liabilities. Accordingly, the Company has recorded an indemnification receivable and we monitor the recoverability of such receivable, which is subject to terms of applicable credit agreements of Garrett and its general ability to pay. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries, and additional details regarding the indemnification and reimbursement agreement. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. Annual pension (income) expense is comprised of service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets, prior service amortization (Pension Ongoing (Income) Expense) and a potential mark-to-market adjustment (MTM Adjustment). The key assumptions used in developing our 2018, 2017 and 2016 net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following: ##TABLE_START          2018  2017  2016 Discount Rate:       Projected benefit obligation   3.68 %    4.20 %    4.46 %  Service cost   3.77 %    4.42 %    4.69 %  Interest cost   3.27 %    3.49 %    3.59 %  Assets:       Expected rate of return   7.75 %    7.75 %    7.75 %  Actual rate of return   -1.8 %    20.5 %    9.7 %  Actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return   11.0 %    7.4 %    6.4 %  ##TABLE_END 31 The MTM Adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor). Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM charges were $37 million, $87 million and $273 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016. We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 21 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). We plan to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 6.75% for 2019 down from 7.75% for 2018 reflecting a re-balancing of assets to more fixed income during 2018. The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We used a 4.35% discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018, reflecting the increase in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end. In addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment: ##TABLE_START      Change in Assumption  Impact on 2019 Pension Ongoing Expense  Impact on PBO 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate  Decrease $20 million  Increase $420 million 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate  Increase $20 million  Decrease $410 million 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets  Increase $41 million   0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets  Decrease $41 million   ##TABLE_END Pension ongoing income for our world-wide pension plans is expected to be approximately $590 million in 2019 compared with pension ongoing income of $992 million in 2018. The expected decrease in pension income is primarily due to lower actual asset returns in 2018 and a lower expected return on asset assumption for 2019 in our U.S. and UK plans. Also, if required, an MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2019, and if one is required, what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. Long-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets) The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations;    Annual operating plans or strategic plan outlook that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line;    Significant negative industry or economic trends; or    Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. ##TABLE_END Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry and business growth rates, sales volume, selling prices and costs, cash flows, and the discount rate selected. These estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility. Management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing. In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions. Income Taxes On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. Our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences.

Sales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts We recognize sales for long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time using either an input or output method. We recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts based on the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We generally use the cost-to-cost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion requires judgment. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Impacts from changes in estimates of net sales and cost of sales are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligations percentage of completion. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting Principles The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is a description of Honeywells significant accounting policies. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. Our consolidation policy requires equity investments that we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investees activities to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding assets useful life. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2018 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. Other Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years. Sales Recognition Product and service sales are recognized when or as we transfer control of the promised products or services to our customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time are recognized using either an input or output method. We recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We generally use the cost-to-cost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. We review our cost estimates on significant contracts on a periodic basis, or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident, to the extent required. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The customer funding for costs incurred for nonrecurring engineering and development activities of our products under agreements with commercial customers is deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue as products are delivered to the customers. Additionally, expenses incurred, up to the customer agreed funded amount, are deferred as an asset and recognized as cost of sales when products are delivered to the customer. The deferred customer funding and costs result in recognition of deferred costs (asset) and deferred revenue (liability) on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Revenues for our mechanical service programs are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied over time, with recognition reflecting a series of distinct services using the output method. The terms of a contract or the historical business practice can give rise to variable consideration due to, but not limited to, cash-based incentives, rebates, performance awards, or credits. We estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount we will receive from customers. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized for such transaction will not occur, or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. For the years ended 2017 and 2016, prior to the adoption of the revenue recognition standard (see Note 7 Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers), product and service sales were recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, product delivery had occurred or services had been rendered, pricing was fixed or determinable, and collection was reasonably assured. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities were recognized over the contractual period or as services were rendered. Sales under long-term contracts were recorded on a percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts were recorded in full when such losses became evident. Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements were recognized as each element was earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements had value to customers on a standalone basis. Amounts allocated to each element were based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product or service when it was sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services. Environmental We accrue costs related to environmental matters when it is probable that we have incurred a liability related to a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For additional information, see Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies. Asbestos Related Liabilities and Insurance Recoveries, and Indemnification Receivables We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. Additionally, in conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Garrett subsidiary, pursuant to which Garretts subsidiary has an obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell as reimbursement for asbestos liabilities. Accordingly, the Company has recorded an indemnification receivable and we monitor the recoverability of such receivable, which is subject to terms of applicable credit agreements of Garrett and its general ability to pay. For additional information, see Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies. Aerospace Sales Incentives We provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of our aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and braking system hardware, avionics, and auxiliary power units, for installation on commercial aircraft. These incentives consist of free or deeply discounted products, credits for future purchases of product or upfront cash payments. These costs are generally recognized in the period incurred as cost of products sold or as a reduction to relevant sales, as appropriate. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Research and Development Research and development costs for company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred. Such costs are principally included in cost of products sold and were $1,809 million, $1,835 million and $1,864 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Stock-Based Compensation Plans The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 19 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units. The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and are based on our historical forfeiture rates. Pension Benefits On January 1, 2018, we retrospectively adopted the new accounting guidance on presentation of net periodic pension costs. That guidance requires that we disaggregate the service cost component of net benefit costs and report those costs in the same line item or items in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other non-service components of net benefit costs are required to be presented separately from the service cost component. Following the adoption of this guidance, we continue to record the service cost component of Pension ongoing (income) expense in Costs of products and services sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining components of net benefit costs within Pension ongoing (income) expense, primarily interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are now recorded in Other (income) expense. See Note 4 Other (Income) Expense for amounts that were reclassified. We will continue to recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment). The MTM Adjustment will also be reported in Other (income) expense. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. Dollars are translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings. Derivative Financial Instruments We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. We do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract. All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. We have elected to exclude the time value of the derivatives (i.e., the forward points) from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize the initial value of the excluded component in earnings using the amortization approach. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is reported as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known. For discussion of the impacts from what is commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S Tax Reform), see Note 5 Income Taxes. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements We consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows (consolidated financial statements). In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases that will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The standard allows modified retrospective transition method where an entity can elect to apply the transition provisions at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new lease accounting standard using the modified retrospective transition option of applying the new standard at the adoption date. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed us to carry forward the historical lease classification. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of additional net lease assets and lease liabilities of approximately $0.7 billion. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact related to existing leases and as a result, a cumulative-effect adjustment was not recorded. We are currently working to complete the implementation of new processes and information technology tools to HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) assist in our ongoing lease data collection and analysis, and updating our accounting policies and internal controls in connection with the adoption of the new standard. In October 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, at the time the entity transfer occurs rather than when the asset is ultimately transferred to a third party, as required under current U.S. GAAP. The guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice, particularly for transfers involving intellectual property. We adopted the accounting standard update as of January 1, 2018. The guidance requires application on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance increases our deferred tax assets by $339 million with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of the same amount. In August 2017, the FASB issued amendments to hedge accounting guidance. These amendments are intended to better align risk management strategies and financial reporting for hedging relationships. Under the new guidance, more hedging strategies will be eligible for hedge accounting and the application of hedge accounting is simplified. In addition, the new guidance amends presentation and disclosure requirements. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In February 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows for an entity to elect to reclassify the income tax effects on items within accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from U.S. Tax Reform to retained earnings. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted, including interim periods within those years. Upon adoption, the Company does not expect to elect to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. Note 2. Acquisitions and Divestitures During 2018, we acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash and debt assumed) of approximately $535 million, mainly due to the November 2018 acquisition of Transnorm, a global leader in high-performance conveyor and warehouse solutions. Transnorm is part of Safety and Productivity Solutions. The preliminary determination of the assets and liabilities acquired with Transnorm have been included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018, including $338 million allocated to goodwill, which is non-deductible for tax purposes. During 2017 there were no significant acquisitions individually or in aggregate. During 2016, we acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash and debt assumed) of $2,538 million. In August 2016, the Company acquired Intelligrated, a leading provider of supply chain and warehouse automation technologies, for an aggregate value, net of cash acquired, of $1,488 million. Intelligrated is part of Safety and Productivity Solutions. Management recorded goodwill and intangible assets acquired of, $1,121 million and $507 million, respectively. The Intelligrated identifiable intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, technology, and trade name that are being amortized over their estimated lives ranging from 1 to 15 years using straight line and accelerated amortization methods. The goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. In April 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Xtralis International Holdings Limited (Xtralis), a leading global provider of aspiration smoke detection and perimeter security technologies, for an aggregate cost, net of cash acquired and debt assumed, of $515 million. Xtralis is part of Honeywell Building Technologies. In February 2016, the Company acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of COM DEV International (COM DEV), a leading satellite and space components provider, for an aggregate value, net of cash acquired and debt assumed, of $347 million. COM DEV is part of Aerospace. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) In January 2016, the Company acquired the remaining 30 percent noncontrolling interest in UOP Russell LLC, which develops technology and manufactures modular equipment to process natural gas, for $240 million. UOP Russell LLC is part of Performance Materials and Technologies. On October 1, 2018, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off to Honeywell shareowners of its Transportation Systems business, part of Aerospace, into a standalone publicly-traded company, Garrett Motion Inc. (Garrett). On October 29, 2018, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off to Honeywell shareowners of its Homes and Global Distribution business, part of Home and Building Technologies (renamed Honeywell Building Technologies following the spin-off), into a standalone publicly-traded company, Resideo Technologies, Inc. (Resideo). The assets of approximately $5.5 billion, including approximately $2.8 billion of goodwill and net of recorded indemnification receivables, and liabilities of approximately $7.2 billion associated with spin-off entities have been removed through Retained Earnings from the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the effective date of the spin-off. The results of operations and cash flows are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows through the effective date of the spin-off. The Income before taxes attributable to the spin-off businesses were $0.4 billion, $0.5 billion, and $0.6 billion for 2018, 2017 and 2016. Honeywell shareowners of record as of the close of business on October 16, 2018 received one share of Resideo common stock for every 6 shares of Honeywell common stock. Immediately prior to the effective date of the spin-off, Resideo incurred debt of $1.2 billion to make a cash distribution to the Company. Honeywell shareowners of record as of the close of business on September 18, 2018 received one share of Garrett common stock for every 10 shares of Honeywell common stock. Immediately prior to the effective date of the spin-off, Garrett incurred debt of $1.6 billion to make a cash distribution to the Company. In 2018 in connection with the spin-off, the Company entered into certain agreements with Resideo and Garrett to effect our legal and structural separation, including transition services agreements to provide certain administrative and other services for a limited time, and tax matters and indemnity agreements. As of the end of 2018, most of those agreements are still in effect. On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off to Honeywell shareowners of its Resins and Chemicals business, part of Performance Materials and Technologies, into a standalone, publicly-traded company (named AdvanSix Inc. (AdvanSix)). The assets and liabilities associated with AdvanSix have been removed from the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the effective date of the spin-off. The results of operations for AdvanSix are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations through the effective date of the spin-off. Honeywell shareowners of record as of the close of business on September 16, 2016 received one share of AdvanSix common stock for every 25 shares of Honeywell common stock. Immediately prior to the effective date of the spin-off, AdvanSix incurred debt to make a cash distribution of $269 million to the Company. At the same time, AdvanSix also incurred $38 million of borrowings in order to fund its post spin-off working capital. In 2016 in connection with the spin-off, the Company entered into certain agreements with AdvanSix to effect our legal and structural separation including a transition services agreement with AdvanSix to provide certain administrative and other services for a limited time. As of the end of 2018, those agreements have ended. On September 16, 2016, the Company completed the sale of Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. for a sale price of $300 million. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $176 million, which was recorded in Other (income) expense. The Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. business was part of Aerospace.

The workforce reductions were primarily related to planned site closures, mainly in Safety and Productivity Solutions, Performance Materials and Technologies and Honeywell Building Technologies, as we transition manufacturing sites to more cost-effective locations. The workforce reductions were also related to our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $162 million mainly related to manufacturing plant and equipment associated with planned site closures. Asset impairments also included the write-down of a legacy property in Corporate in connection with its planned disposition and the write-off of certain capitalized assets in Corporate. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $79 million primarily related to a termination fee associated with the early cancellation of a supply agreement for certain raw materials in Performance Materials and Technologies and for closure obligations associated with planned site closures. In 2017, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $507 million including severance costs of $305 million related to workforce reductions of 7,096 manufacturing and administrative positions across HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives and with site transitions, in each of our segments, to more cost-effective locations. The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $142 million principally in our Corporate segment related to the write-down of legacy properties and certain equipment in connection with their planned disposition and the write-down of a research and development facility in connection with a planned exit from such facility. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $60 million principally for closure obligations associated with site transitions in each of our segments and for lease exit obligations in our Corporate segment. In 2016, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $369 million including severance costs of $283 million related to workforce reductions of 6,585 manufacturing and administrative positions across our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives; the separation of the former Automation and Control Solutions reporting segment into two new reporting segments; site transitions in each of our segments to more cost-effective locations; and achieving acquisition-related synergies. The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $43 million principally related to the write-off of certain intangible assets in connection with the sale of a Performance Materials and Technologies business. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $43 million principally for expenses related to the spin-off of our AdvanSix business and closure obligations associated with site transitions. Also, $109 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned to income as a result of higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments, lower than expected severance costs in certain repositioning actions, and changes in scope of previously announced repositioning actions.

The decrease was primarily attributable to internal restructuring initiatives that resulted in a reduction of accrued withholding taxes of approximately $1.1 billion related to unremitted foreign earnings. In addition, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $440 million as a reduction to our 2017 provisional estimate of impacts from U.S. Tax Reform, which was partially offset by $411 million of tax costs associated with the internal restructuring of the Homes and Global Distribution business and Transportation Systems business in advance of their spin-offs. The Companys non-U.S. effective tax rate was 4.1%, a decrease of approximately 67.3 percentage points compared to 2017. The year over year decrease in the foreign effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the impact of the Companys internal restructuring initiatives and the reduction of accrued withholding taxes on unremitted foreign earnings, partially offset by the spin-off transactions. The effective tax rate increased by 52.4 percentage points in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to the provisional impact of U.S. Tax Reform, partially offset by increased tax benefits from foreign tax credits and for employee share-based payments. The Companys non-U.S. effective tax rate was 71.4%, an increase of approximately 54.7 percentage points compared to 2016. The year-over-year increase in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily driven by the Companys change in assertion regarding foreign unremitted earnings, increased expense for reserves in various jurisdictions and increased withholding taxes, partially offset by higher earnings in low tax rate jurisdictions.

We maintain a valuation allowance of $686 million against a portion of the non-U.S. gross deferred tax assets. The change in the valuation allowance resulted in increases of $57 million, $4 million and $69 million to income tax expense in 2018, 2017 and 2016. In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a reduction to income tax expense in the period that such determination is made.

In addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods. Unrecognized tax benefits for examinations in progress were $304 million, $487 million and $398 million, as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of Tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and totaled $45 million, $28 million and $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Accrued interest and penalties were $426 million, $423 million and $395 million, as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) U.S. Tax Reform During the quarter ending December 31, 2018, the Company completed the accounting for the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform which amounted to a total tax charge of approximately $3.5 billion, most of which was recorded as a provisional estimate at the end of 2017. During 2018, we reduced our provisional estimate by approximately $440 million as a reduction to Tax expense. Corporate Tax Rate Change The Company recorded a total tax benefit of approximately $190 million due to the decrease in the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%. This includes a measurement period adjustment of approximately $90 million recorded during 2018 as a reduction to Tax expense. The change in the provisional estimate primarily relates to information contained in tax returns that were filed during the quarter ending December 31, 2018, some of which require approval from U.S. tax authorities. The tax benefit from the change in tax rates results from the Companys deferred tax liability position for the excess of its net book value over its tax basis of its U.S. assets and liabilities that will generate future taxable income in excess of book income. This additional taxable income will be subject to tax at a lower corporate tax rate, consequently reducing the Companys deferred tax liability. Mandatory Transition Tax The Company recorded a total tax charge of approximately $1,950 million due to the imposition of the mandatory transition tax (MTT) on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. This includes a measurement period adjustment of approximately $50 million recorded during 2018 as an increase to Tax expense. The change in the provisional estimate primarily relates to updated amounts from tax returns that were finalized during 2018, computations based on 2018 testing dates and guidance from the taxing authorities that was received during the year. The Company has elected to pay the MTT liability over a period of eight years. Undistributed Foreign Earnings The Company recorded a total tax charge of approximately $1,700 million due to the Companys intent to no longer permanently reinvest the historical unremitted earnings of its foreign affiliates that existed as of December 31, 2017. This includes a measurement period adjustment of approximately $400 million recorded during 2018 as a reduction to Tax expense. The change in the provisional estimate primarily relates to updated amounts from tax returns that were finalized during 2018, the application of foreign tax credits based on guidance issued during the year and changes to the applicable withholding tax rates in local jurisdictions. During 2018, the Company executed various internal restructuring initiatives that reduced the taxes on unremitted foreign earnings by approximately $1.1 billion that was recorded as a reduction to Tax expense. Global Intangible Low Taxed Income U.S. Tax Reform imposes a U.S. tax on global intangible low taxed income (GILTI) that is earned by certain foreign affiliates owned by a U.S. shareholder. GILTI is generally intended to impose tax on the earnings of a foreign corporation that are deemed to exceed a certain threshold return relative to the underlying business investment. The Company has made a policy election to treat future taxes related to GILTI as a current period expense in the reporting period in which the tax is incurred. Note 6. Earnings Per Share The details of the earnings per share calculations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows: ##TABLE_START        Basic  Years Ended December 31,  2018  2017  2016 Net income attributable to Honeywell  $  6,765   $  1,545   $  4,812  Weighted average shares outstanding   743.0    762.1    764.3  Earnings per share of common stock  $  9.10   $  2.03   $  6.30  ##TABLE_END 53 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

In 2018, 2017, and 2016 the weighted number of stock options excluded from the computations were 2.5 million, 2.8 million, and 7.5 million. These stock options were outstanding at the end of each of the respective periods. Note 7. Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers Adoption On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new guidance on revenue from contracts with customers using the modified retrospective method applied to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under the new guidance, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with previous guidance. We recorded a net decrease to opening retained earnings of $75 million as of January 1, 2018, for the cumulative impact of adopting the new guidance. The impact primarily related to the change in accounting for mechanical service programs (change from input to output method, resulting in unbilled receivables (within Accounts receivablenet) and deferred revenue (within Accrued liabilities) being eliminated through Retained earnings) and for customer funding and the related costs incurred for nonrecurring engineering and development activities (deferral of revenues and related incurred costs until products are delivered to customers, resulting in increases in both deferred costs (assets) and deferred revenue (liability) by approximately $1.1 billion at adoption). ##TABLE_START          Balance at December 31, 2017  New Revenue Standard Adjustment  Balance at January 1, 2018 ASSETS       Current assets:       Accounts receivablenet  $  8,866   $  (149 )   $  8,717  Inventories   4,613    (10 )    4,603  Deferred income taxes   251    40    291  Other assets   3,372    1,082    4,454  LIABILITIES       Current liabilities:       Accrued liabilities   6,968    (48 )    6,920  Deferred income taxes   2,664    1    2,665  Other liabilities   5,930    1,084    7,014  SHAREOWNERS EQUITY       Retained earnings   27,481    (75 )    27,406  Noncontrolling interest  $    $    $   ##TABLE_END 54 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Under the modified retrospective method of adoption, we are required to disclose the impact to revenues had we continued to follow our accounting policies under the previous revenue recognition guidance. We estimate that the impact to revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 would have been a decrease of approximately $339 million, which is primarily due to the net impact of the classification change and deferral impact of nonrecurring engineering and development activities, and the net impact from service programs with certain amounts being recognized that would have previously been deferred, and certain amount being deferred that would have previously been recognized.

For a summary by disaggregated product and services sales for each segment, refer to Note 22 Segment Financial Data. We recognize revenue arising from performance obligations outlined in contracts with our customers that are satisfied at a point in time and over time. The disaggregation of our revenue based off timing of recognition is as follows: ##TABLE_START      Year Ended December 31, 2018 Products, transferred point in time   67 %  Products, transferred over time   12     Net product sales   79  Services, transferred point in time   7  Services, transferred over time   14     Net service sales   21     Net sales   100 %     ##TABLE_END 56 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Contract Balances Progress on satisfying performance obligations under contracts with customers and the related billings and cash collections are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accounts receivablenet and Other assets (the current and noncurrent portions, respectively, of unbilled receivables (contract assets) and billed receivables) and Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities (the current and noncurrent portions, respectively, of customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities)). Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the timing of cash collected from customers differs from the timing of revenue recognition, such as when contract provisions require specific milestones to be met before a customer can be billed. Those assets are recognized when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized prior to billing and derecognized when billed in accordance with the terms of the contract. Contract liabilities are recorded when customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of us satisfying performance obligations under contractual arrangements, including those with performance obligations to be satisfied over a period of time. Contract liabilities are derecognized when revenue is recorded, either when a milestone is met triggering the contractual right to bill or when the performance obligation is satisfied. Contract balances are classified as assets or liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. The following table summarizes our contract assets and liabilities balances: ##TABLE_START      2018 Contract assetsJanuary 1  $  1,721  Contract assetsDecember 31   1,548     Change in contract assetsincrease (decrease)  $  (173 )     Contract liabilitiesJanuary 1  $  (2,973 )  Contract liabilitiesDecember 31   (3,378 )     Change in contract liabilities(increase) decrease  $  (405 )     Net change  $  (578 )     ##TABLE_END The net change was primarily driven by the receipt of advance payments from customers exceeding reductions from recognition of revenue as performance obligations were satisfied and related billings. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized revenue of $1,166 million that was previously included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities. When contracts are modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements, we consider whether the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications that are for goods or services that are not distinct from the existing contract, due to the significant integration with the original good or service provided, are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and our measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis. When the modifications include additional performance obligations that are distinct and at relative stand-alone selling price, they are accounted for as a new contract and performance obligation, which are recognized prospectively. Performance Obligations A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is defined as the unit of account. A contracts transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When our contracts with customers require highly complex integration or manufacturing HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) services that are not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct, then the entire contract is accounted for as a single performance obligation. In situations when our contract includes distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time, they are recognized as a series of distinct goods or services. For any contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contracts transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. For product sales, each product sold to a customer typically represents a distinct performance obligation. In such cases, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the stand alone selling price. Performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time or over time. Performance obligations are supported by contracts with customers, providing a framework for the nature of the distinct goods, services or bundle of goods and services. The timing of satisfying the performance obligation is typically indicated by the terms of the contract. The following table outlines our performance obligations disaggregated by segment. ##TABLE_START      2018 Aerospace  $  10,228  Honeywell Building Technologies   6,302  Performance Materials and Technologies   6,436  Safety and Productivity Solutions   1,884      $  24,850     ##TABLE_END Performance obligations recognized as of December 31, 2018 will be satisfied over the course of future periods. Our disclosure of the timing for satisfying the performance obligation is based on the requirements of contracts with customers. However, from time to time, these contracts may be subject to modifications, impacting the timing of satisfying the performance obligations. Performance obligations expected to be satisfied within one year and greater than one year are 56% and 44%. The timing of satisfaction of our performance obligations does not significantly vary from the typical timing of payment. Typical payment terms of our fixed-price over time contracts include progress payments based on specified events or milestones, or based on project progress. For some contracts we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. We have applied the practical expedient for certain revenue streams to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less or (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue in proportion to the amount we have the right to invoice for services performed.

The 2017 Notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywells existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of Honeywells subordinated debt. The offering resulted in gross proceeds of $1,200 million, offset by $5 million in discount and closing costs related to the offering. In November of 2017, the Company issued $445 million 3.812% Senior Notes due 2047 (the Exchange Notes). The Exchange Notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywells existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of Honeywells subordinated debt. The Exchange Notes were issued in partial exchange for the 6.625% Debentures due 2028, the 5.70% Notes due 2036, the 5.70% Notes due 2037 and the 5.375% Notes due 2041. The Company paid $133 million to bondholders in connection with the partial exchange. On January 29, 2018, the Company completed an exchange offer for any and all of its outstanding Exchange Notes, which had not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act) for an equal principal amount of new 3.812% Notes due 2047 which had been registered under the Securities Act (Registered Notes). 99.4% of the Exchange Notes were exchanged for Registered Notes, representing 99.4% of the principal amount of the Companys outstanding 3.812% Notes due 2047. On February 22, 2018, the Company paid its Two year floating rate Euro notes due 2018. For the issuances described above, unless otherwise noted, all debt issuance costs are deferred and recognized as a direct deduction to the related debt liability and are amortized to interest expense over the debt term. In connection with the Garrett spin-off, wholly owned subsidiaries of Garrett issued notes and entered new credit facilities, which obligations were retained by Garrett in the spin-off. On September 27, 2018 the Company received net proceeds of $1,604 million from such borrowings.

Note 15. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Credit and Market Risk Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers. Foreign Currency Risk Management We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. Our primary objective is to preserve the U.S. Dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows and earnings. We attempt to hedge currency exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts (foreign currency exchange contracts) with third parties. We hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in other (income) expense. We partially hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which are denominated in non-functional currencies, with foreign currency exchange contracts. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had contracts with notional amounts of $14,995 million and $9,273 million to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S. Dollar, Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Mexican Peso, Swiss Franc, Indian Rupee, Russian Ruble, and Chinese Renminbi. As of December 31, 2018, we estimate that approximately $90 million of net HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) derivative gains related to our cash flow hedges included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. We have also designated foreign currency debt and certain derivative contracts as hedges against portions of our net investment in foreign operations during the year ended December 31, 2018. Gains or losses on the effective portion of the foreign currency debt designated as a net investment hedge are recorded in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. The Company did not have ineffectiveness related to net investment hedges during the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest Rate Risk Management We use a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively changed $2,600 million of fixed rate debt at 2.93% to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Our interest rate swaps mature at various dates through 2026. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The FASBs accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 and 2017: ##TABLE_START        December 31,  2018  2017 Assets:     Foreign currency exchange contracts  $    $   Available for sale investments   1,784    3,916  Interest rate swap agreements   20    44  Cross currency swap agreements   32      Liabilities:     Foreign currency exchange contracts  $    $   Interest rate swap agreements   65    52  ##TABLE_END The foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate swap agreements, and cross currency swap agreements are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale and are valued using published prices based off observable market data. As such, these investments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds available for sale investments in U.S. government and corporate debt securities valued utilizing published prices based on quoted market pricing, which are classified within level 1. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were not carried at fair value: ##TABLE_START            December 31, 2018  December 31, 2017  Carrying Value  Fair Value  Carrying Value  Fair Value Assets         Long-term receivables  $    $    $    $   Liabilities         Long-term debt and related current maturities  $  12,628   $  13,133   $  13,924   $  14,695  ##TABLE_END 64 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

As such, the fair value of these receivables is considered level 2. The Company determined the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities utilizing transactions in the listed markets for identical or similar liabilities. As such, the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities is considered level 2. Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or losses on the derivative recognized in interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt being hedged. Losses on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $37 million, $29 million and $71 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Gains and losses are fully offset by losses and gains on the underlying debt being hedged. We economically hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts. These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. We recognized $394 million of income and $207 million of expense in Other (income) expense in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. We recognized $232 million of income in Other (income) expense in the year ended December 31, 2016.

Following approval of both plans, we have not and will not grant any new awards under any previously existing stock-based compensation plans. At December 31, 2018, there were 40,270,690, and 893,809 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants under terms of the 2016 Plan and 2016 Directors Plan, respectively. Stock Options The exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under our stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of our stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employees requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded liabilities for environmental costs: ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2018  2017  2016 Beginning of year  $    $    $   Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable   395    287    195  Environmental liability payments   (218 )    (212 )    (228 )  Other   (17 )    9    26         End of year  $    $    $          ##TABLE_END Environmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts: ##TABLE_START          December 31,    2018  2017 Accrued liabilities  $    $    Other liabilities   580    369         $    $         ##TABLE_END We do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined although they could be material to our consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. In conjunction with the Resideo spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Resideo subsidiary, pursuant to which Resideos subsidiary has an ongoing obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to 90 percent of Honeywells annual net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the agreement. The amount payable to Honeywell in any given year is subject to a cap of $140 million, and the obligation will continue until the earlier of December 31, 2043, or December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual payment obligation has been less than $25 million. Reimbursements associated with this indemnification agreement were $25 million in 2018 and offset operating cash outflows incurred by the Company. As the Company records the accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable related to the sites covered by the indemnification agreement, a corresponding receivable from Resideo for 90 percent of that accrual is also recorded. This receivable amount recorded in 2018 subsequent to the spin-off was $50 million. As HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) of December 31, 2018, Other Current Assets and Other Assets includes $140 million and $476 million representing the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Resideo under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement. Asbestos Matters Honeywell is a defendant in asbestos related personal injury actions related to North American Refractories Company (NARCO), which was sold in 1986, and Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix) business, which was sold in 2014. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company revised its accounting to correct the time period associated with the determination of appropriate accruals for the legacy Bendix asbestos-related liability for unasserted claims. The prior accounting treatment applied a five-year time horizon; the revised treatment reflects the full term of epidemiological projections through 2059. Previously issued financial statements have been revised for this correction with the following effects: The Companys revised estimated asbestos-related liabilities are now $2,610 million as of December 31, 2017, which is $1,087 million higher than the Companys prior estimate. The Companys insurance recoveries for asbestos-related liabilities are estimated to be $503 million as of December 31, 2017, which is $68 million higher than the Companys prior estimate. As of December 31, 2017, the net deferred income taxes impact was $245 million, with a decrease to liabilities and increase to assets, and the cumulative impact on retained earnings was a decrease of $774 million. For 2017 and 2016 Cost of services sold decreased $48 million and $5 million, Tax expense increased $158 million and $2 million, and Net income decreased $110 million and $3 million. This revision followed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Division of Corporation Finance review of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2017, which included review of our prior accounting for liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims. On September 13, 2018, following completion of Corporation Finances review, the SEC Division of Enforcement advised that it has opened an investigation related to this matter. Honeywell intends to provide requested information and otherwise fully cooperate with the SEC staff. On October 31, 2018, David Kanefsky, a Honeywell shareholder, filed a putative class action complaint alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 related to the prior accounting for Bendix asbestos claims. We believe the Complaint has no merit.

When the NARCO business was sold, Honeywells predecessor entered into a cross-indemnity agreement with NARCO which included an obligation to indemnify the purchaser for asbestos claims. Such claims arise primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestos-containing refractory brick and mortar for high-temperature applications. NARCO ceased manufacturing these products in 1980, and the first asbestos claims were filed in the tort system against NARCO in 1983. Claims filings and related costs increased dramatically in the late 1990s through 2001, which led to NARCO filing for bankruptcy in January 2002. Once NARCO filed for bankruptcy, all then current and future NARCO asbestos claims were stayed against both NARCO and Honeywell pending the reorganization of NARCO. Following the bankruptcy filing, in December 2002 Honeywell recorded a total NARCO asbestos liability of $3.2 billion, which was comprised of three components: (i) the estimated liability to settle pre-bankruptcy petition NARCO claims and certain post-petition settlements ($2.2 billion, referred to as Pre-bankruptcy NARCO Liability), (ii) the estimated liability related to then unasserted NARCO claims for the period 2004 through 2018 ($950 million, referred to as NARCO Trust Liability), and (iii) other NARCO bankruptcy-related obligations totaling $73 million. When the NARCO Trust Liability of $950 million was established in 2002, the methodology for estimating the potential liability was based primarily on: (a) epidemiological projections of the future incidence of disease for the period 2004 through 2018, a fifteen-year period; (b) historical claims rates in the tort system for the five-year period prior to the bankruptcy filing date; and (c) anticipated NARCO Trust payment values set forth in the then current draft of the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures. The methodology required estimating, by disease, three critical inputs: (i) likely number of claims to be asserted against the NARCO Trust in the future, (ii) percentage of those claims likely to receive payment, and (iii) payment values. The Company utilized outside asbestos liability valuation specialists HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) to support our preparation of the NARCO Trust Liability estimate, which was based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts. In 2002, when we first established our initial liability, NARCO asbestos claims resolution shifted from the tort system to an anticipated NARCO Trust framework, where claims would be processed in accordance with established NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures, including strict medical and exposure criteria for a plaintiff to receive compensation. We believed at the time that the NARCO Trusts claims filing and resolution experience after the NARCO Trust became operational would be significantly different from pre-bankruptcy tort system experience in light of these more rigorous claims processing requirements in the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures and Honeywells active oversight of claims processing and approval. Given these anticipated differences, we believed that a 15-year time period was the appropriate horizon for establishing a probable and reasonably estimable liability for then unasserted NARCO claims as it represented our best estimate of the time period it would take for the NARCO Trust to be approved by the Bankruptcy Court, become fully operational and generate sufficiently reliable claims data (i.e., a data set which is statistically representative) to enable us to update our NARCO Trust Liability. The NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures were finalized in 2006, and the Company updated its NARCO Trust Liability to reflect the final terms and payment values. The original 15-year period (from 2004 through 2018) for unasserted claims did not change as asbestos claims filings continued to be stayed against both Honeywell and NARCO. The 2006 update resulted in a range of the estimated liability for unasserted claims of $743 million to $961 million, and we believed that no amount within this range was a better estimate than any other amount. In accordance with ASC 450Contingencies (ASC 450), we recorded the low end of the range of $743 million which resulted in a reduction of $207 million in our NARCO Trust Liability. NARCO emerged from bankruptcy on April 30, 2013, at which time a federally authorized 524(g) trust was established for the evaluation and resolution of all existing and future NARCO asbestos claims. Both Honeywell and NARCO are protected by a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products to be made against the NARCO Trust. The NARCO Trust Agreement and the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures are the principal documents setting forth the structure of the NARCO Trust. These documents establish Honeywells evergreen funding obligations. Honeywell is obligated to fund NARCO asbestos claims submitted to the NARCO Trust which qualify for payment under the Trust Distribution Procedures (Annual Contribution Claims), subject to an annual cap of $145 million. However, the initial $100 million of claims processed through the NARCO Trust (the Initial Claims Amount) will not count against the annual cap and any unused portion of the Initial Claims Amount will roll over to subsequent years until fully utilized. These documents also establish the material operating rules for the NARCO Trust, including Honeywell audit rights and the criteria claimants must meet to have a valid claim paid. These claims payment criteria include providing the NARCO Trust with adequate medical evidence of the claimants asbestos-related condition and credible evidence of exposure to a specific NARCO asbestos-containing product. Further, the NARCO Trust is eligible to receive cash dividends from Harbison-Walker International Inc (HWI), the reorganized and renamed entity that emerged, fully operational, from the NARCO bankruptcy. The NARCO Trust is required to use any funding received from HWI to pay Annual Contribution Claims until those funds are exhausted. It is only at this point that Honeywells funding obligation to the Trust is triggered. Thus, there is an unrelated primary source for funding that affects Honeywells funding of the NARCO Trust Liability. Once operational, the NARCO Trust began to receive, process and pay claims that had been previously stayed pending the Trust becoming operational. As the NARCO Trust began to pay claims in 2014, we began to assert our on-going audit rights to review and monitor the claims processors adherence to the established requirements of the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures. While doing HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) so, we identified several issues with the way the Trust was implementing the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures. In 2015, Honeywell filed suit against the NARCO Trust in Bankruptcy Court alleging breach of certain provisions of the NARCO Trust Agreement and NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures. The parties agreed to dismiss the proceeding without prejudice pursuant to an 18-month Standstill Agreement, which expired in October 2017. Notwithstanding its expiration, claims processing continues, and Honeywell continues to negotiate and attempt to resolve remaining disputed issues (that is, instances where Honeywell believes the NARCO Trust is not processing claims in accordance with established NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures). Honeywell reserves the right to seek judicial intervention should negotiations fail. After the NARCO Trust became effective in 2013, the $743 million NARCO Trust Liability was then comprised of: (i) liability for unasserted claims; and (ii) liability for claims asserted after the NARCO Trust became operational but not yet paid. Although we know the number of claims filed with the NARCO Trust each year, we are not able to determine at this time the portion of the NARCO Trust Liability which represents asserted versus unasserted claims due to the lack of sufficiently reliable claims data because of the claims processing issues described previously. Honeywell maintained the $743 million accrual for NARCO Trust Liability, as there has not been sufficiently reliable claims data history to enable us to update that liability. As of December 31, 2018, our total NARCO asbestos liability of $891 million reflects Pre-bankruptcy NARCO liability of $148 million and NARCO Trust Liability of $743 million. Through December 31, 2018, Pre-bankruptcy NARCO Liability has been reduced by approximately $2 billion since first established in 2002, largely related to settlement payments. The remaining Pre-bankruptcy NARCO liability principally represents estimated amounts owed pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and Trust Distribution Procedures. The other NARCO bankruptcy obligations were paid in 2013 and no further liability is recorded. As of December 31, 2018, Honeywell has not made any payments to the NARCO Trust for Annual Contribution Claims as Annual Contribution Claims which have been paid since the Trust became operational have been funded by cash dividends from HWI. Honeywell continues to evaluate the appropriateness of the $743 million NARCO Trust Liability. Despite becoming effective in 2013, the NARCO Trust has experienced delays in becoming fully operational. Violations of the Trust Distribution Procedures and the resulting disputes and challenges, a standstill pending dispute resolution, and limited claims payments, have all contributed to the lack of sufficient normalized data based on actual claims processing experience in the Trust since it became operational. As a result, we have not been able to further update the NARCO Trust Liability. The $743 million NARCO Trust Liability continues to be appropriate because of the unresolved pending claims in the Trust, some portion of which will result in payouts in the future, and because new claims continue to be filed with the NARCO Trust. When sufficiently reliable claims data exists, we will update our estimate of the NARCO Trust Liability and it is possible that a material change may need to be recognized. Our insurance receivable of $307 million as of December 31, 2018, corresponding to the estimated liability for asserted and unasserted NARCO asbestos claims, reflects coverage which reimburses Honeywell for portions of NARCO-related indemnity and defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. We conduct analyses to estimate the probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos claims. While the substantial majority of our HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. We made judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. Bendix Products Bendix manufactured automotive brake linings that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form. Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of individuals who performed brake replacements. The following tables present information regarding Bendix related asbestos claims activity: ##TABLE_START      Claims Activity  Years Ended December 31,  2018  2017 Claims Unresolved at the beginning of year   6,280    7,724  Claims Filed   2,430    2,645  Claims Resolved   (2,501 )    (4,089 )       Claims Unresolved at the end of year   6,209    6,280       ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START      Disease Distribution of Unresolved Claims  December 31,  2018  2017 Mesothelioma and Other Cancer Claims   2,949    3,062  Nonmalignant Claims   3,260    3,218       Total Claims   6,209    6,280       ##TABLE_END Honeywell has experienced average resolution values per claim excluding legal costs as follows: ##TABLE_START              Years Ended December 31,  2018  2017  2016  2015  2014   (in whole dollars) Malignant claims  $  55,300   $  56,000   $  44,000   $  44,000   $  53,500  Nonmalignant claims  $  4,700   $  2,800   $  4,485   $    $   ##TABLE_END It is not possible to predict whether resolution values for Bendix-related asbestos claims will increase, decrease or stabilize in the future. Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of asserted (claims filed as of the financial statement date) and unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims and excludes the Companys legal fees to defend such asbestos claims which will continue to be expensed by the Company as they are incurred. We have valued Bendix asserted and unasserted claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix asserted and unasserted claims during the fourth quarter each year. Honeywell reflects the inclusion of all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 when estimating the liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims. Such liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. Our insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of asserted and unasserted Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) solvency of our insurers, judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with our insurers. In conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Garrett subsidiary, pursuant to which Garretts subsidiary will have an obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to (i) 90% of Honeywells asbestos-related liability payments primarily related to the Bendix business in the United States, as well as certain environmental-related liability payments and accounts payable and non-United States asbestos-related liability payments, in each case related to legacy elements of the Garrett business, including the legal costs of defending and resolving such liabilities, less (ii) 90% of Honeywells net insurance receipts and, as may be applicable, certain other recoveries associated with such liabilities. The amount payable to Honeywell in respect of such liabilities arising in any given year will be subject to a cap of approximately Euro 150 million (equivalent to $175 million at the time the indemnification agreement was entered into). The obligation will continue until the earlier of December 31, 2048, or December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual indemnification obligation has been less than the Euro equivalent, at the fixed exchange rate at time of the indemnification agreement, of $25 million. Reimbursements associated with this indemnification agreement were $42 million in 2018. As the Company records the accruals for matters covered by the indemnification agreement, a corresponding receivable from Garrett is recorded for 90 percent of that accrual as determined by the terms of the agreement. In 2018 subsequent to the spin-off, the Company recorded a reversal to the receivable for $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2018, Other Current Assets and Other Assets includes $171 million and $1,058 million representing the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Garrett under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement. Other Matters We are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Included in these other matters are the following: Honeywell v. United Auto Workers (UAW) et. al In September 2011, the UAW and certain Honeywell retirees (Plaintiffs) filed a suit in the Eastern District of Michigan (the District Court) alleging that a series of Master Collective Bargaining Agreements (MCBAs) between Honeywell and the UAW provided the retirees with rights to lifetime, vested healthcare benefits that could never be changed or reduced. Plaintiffs alleged that Honeywell had violated those vested rights by implementing express limitations (CAPS) on the amount Honeywell contributed toward healthcare coverage for the retirees. Honeywell subsequently answered the UAWs complaint and asserted counterclaims, including for breach of implied warranty. Between 2014 and 2015, Honeywell began enforcing the CAPS against former employees. In response, the UAW and certain of the Plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a ruling that the MCBAs do not limit Honeywells obligation to contribute to healthcare coverage for those retirees. On March 29, 2018, the District Court issued its opinion resolving all pending summary judgment motions, except for Honeywells counterclaim for breach of implied warranty, which has since been dismissed without prejudice. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) In the opinion, the District Court held that the MCBAs do not promise retirees vested, lifetime benefits that survive expiration of the MCBAs. Based on this ruling, Honeywell terminated the retirees healthcare coverage benefits altogether as of July 31, 2018. In response, the UAW filed a motion to enjoin Honeywell from completely terminating coverage as of July 31, 2018, arguing that the CAPS themselves are vested and that Honeywell must continue to provide retiree medical benefits at the capped level. On July 28, 2018, the District Court denied the UAWs motion and entered a final judgment consistent with its March 2018 ruling. The UAW has appealed this decision to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Honeywell believes the District Courts ruling will be upheld. In the March 2018 opinion, the District Court also held that Honeywell is obligated under the MCBAs to pay the full premium for retiree healthcare rather than the capped amount. Based on this ruling, Honeywell would be required to pay monetary damages to retirees for any past years in which Honeywell paid less than the full premium of their healthcare coverage. Such damages would be limited, depending on the retiree group, to a two to three-year period ending when the 2016 MCBA expired, and Honeywell would have no ongoing obligation to continue funding healthcare coverage for subsequent periods. Honeywell has appealed the District Courts ruling on this full premium damages issue, and believes that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals will reverse the District Court on that issue. In the event the Sixth Circuit were to sustain the District Courts ruling on this issue, Honeywell would be liable for damages of at least $12 million. Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations (including the specific matter referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above). Considering our past experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. Warranties and Guarantees In the normal course of business we issue product warranties and product performance guarantees. We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale. Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties and guarantees are made as changes to the obligations become reasonably estimable. The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded obligations for product warranties and product performance guarantees. ##TABLE_START          Years Ended December 31,  2018  2017  2016 Beginning of year  $    $    $   Accruals for warranties/guarantees issued during the year   208    215    326  Adjustment of pre-existing warranties/guarantees   (78 )    (27 )    (40 )  Settlement of warranty/guarantee claims   (228 )    (267 )    (215 )         End of year  $    $    $          ##TABLE_END 80 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywells U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywells U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywells U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Rate was changed to 3.60% for the remainder of 2017 due to Plan remeasurement as of 3/1/17. ##TABLE_END The discount rate for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefits plans reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be settled at the measurement date of December 31. To determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments. We use the single weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. We utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension benefit (income) for our significant pension plans. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. For our U.S. pension plans, the single weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2019 are 4.47% and 3.94%. The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Our expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 6.75% at December 31, 2018 was down from 7.75% at December 31, 2017 reflecting a re-balancing of assets to more fixed income during 2018. Our asset return assumption is based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations with a focus on long-term trends rather than short-term market conditions. We review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. For non-U.S. benefit plans actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country. Pension Benefits The following amounts relate to our significant pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets. ##TABLE_START            December 31,  U.S. Plans  Non-U.S. Plans  2018  2017  2018  2017 Projected benefit obligation  $    $    $  1,668   $  1,082  Accumulated benefit obligation  $    $    $  1,604   $  1,018  Fair value of plan assets          $    $   ##TABLE_END Accumulated benefit obligation for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $16.1 billion and $18.1 billion and for our Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $6.1 billion and $6.9 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Our asset investment strategy for our U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve our long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. During 2018, we began to employ a de-risking strategy which increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation. Our long-term target allocations are as follows: 45%-70% fixed income securities and cash, 35%-50% equity securities, 5%-10% real estate investments, and 10%-20% other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located both inside and outside the United States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies. We review our assets on a regular basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations. Our non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing funding and investment guidance. Our non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country as local regulations, funding requirements, and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. In accordance with ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the following tables are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented for the total pension benefits plan assets.

Sufficient cash or cash equivalents are held by our pension plans to cover the notional value of the futures contracts. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $2,808 million and $4,188 million. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $111 million and $133 million. In both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is related to outstanding equity and fixed income futures contracts. Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgages, asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in collective trust funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals. Our funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made. We are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2019. In 2018, contributions of $115 million were made to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. In 2019, we expect to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $42 million to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Contributions for both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Segment Financial Data We globally manage our business operations through four reportable operating segments. Segment information is consistent with how management reviews the businesses, makes investing and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance. Honeywells senior management evaluates segment performance based on segment profit. Segment profit is measured as segment income (loss) before taxes excluding general corporate unallocated expense, other income (expense), interest and other financial charges, stock compensation expenses, pension and other postretirement benefits (expense), stock compensation expense and repositioning and other charges.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Honeywell International Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareowners equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the accompanying 2017 and 2016 consolidated statements of operations have been retrospectively adjusted for the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2017-07, CompensationRetirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost . Basis for Opinions The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP Parsippany, New Jersey February 8, 2019 We have served as the Companys auditor since 2014.

EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS As of December 31, 2018 information about our equity compensation plans is as follows: ##TABLE_START        Plan category  Number of Shares to be Issued Upon Exercise of Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights  Weighted-Average Exercise Price of Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights  Number of Securities Remaining Available for Future Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans (Excluding Securities Reflected in Column (a))  (a)  (b)  (c) Equity compensation plans approved by security holders   26,746,020 (1)   $  97.83 (2)    42,792,180 (3)  Equity compensation plans not approved by security holders   328,003 (4)    N/A (5)    N/A (6)         Total   27,074,023   $  97.83    42,792,180         ##TABLE_END 98 ##TABLE_START  (1)  Equity compensation plans approved by shareowners which are included in column (a) of the table are the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan, and the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (including 22,222,860 shares of Common Stock to be issued for options; 3,617,539 RSUs subject to continued employment; and 631,082 deferred RSUs); and the 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (including 255,721 shares of Common Stock to be issued for options; and 18,818 RSUs subject to continued services). RSUs included in column (a) of the table represent the full number of RSUs awarded and outstanding whereas the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon vesting will be lower than what is reflected on the table because the value of shares required to meet employee tax withholding requirements are not issued.    1,110,753 growth plan units were issued and remain outstanding for the performance cycle commencing January 1, 2016 and ended December 31, 2017 pursuant to the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan. The value of this growth plan award will be paid in cash and, thus, growth plan units are not included in the table above.    Because the number of future shares that may be distributed to employees participating in the Honeywell Global Stock Plan is unknown, no shares attributable to that plan are included in column (a) of the table above.  (2)  Column (b) relates to stock options and does not include any exercise price for RSUs because an RSUs value is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals or continued employment or service and they are settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis.  (3)  The number of shares that may be issued under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2018 is 40,270,690 which includes the following additional shares that may again be available for issuance: shares that are settled for cash, expire, are canceled, or under similar prior plans, are tendered as option exercise price or tax withholding obligations, are reacquired with cash option exercise price or with monies attributable to any tax deduction to Honeywell upon the exercise of an option, or are under any outstanding awards assumed under any equity compensation plan of an entity acquired by Honeywell. No securities are available for future issuance under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan or the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan.    The number of shares that may be issued under the Honeywell Global Stock Plan as of December 31, 2018 is 1,807,681. This plan is an umbrella plan for three plans described below maintained solely for eligible employees of participating non-U.S. countries. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The UK Sharebuilder Plan allows an eligible UK employee to invest taxable earnings in Common Stock. The Company matches those shares and dividends paid are used to purchase additional shares of Common Stock. For the year ending December 31, 2018, 42,697 shares were credited to participants accounts under the UK Sharebuilder Plan.    The Honeywell Aerospace Ireland Share Participation Plan, the Honeywell Measurex (Ireland) Limited Group Employee Profit Sharing Plan, and the Honeywell International Technologies Limited Employee Share Ownership Plan allow eligible Irish employees to contribute a percentage of base pay and/or bonus that is invested in Common Stock. For the year ending December 31, 2018, 4,139 shares of Common Stock were credited to participants accounts under these plans. The Honeywell International Technologies Limited Employee Share Ownership Plan was part of the spinoff of the Transportation Systems business that occurred on October 1, 2018 and is no longer sponsored by Honeywell. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The remaining 893,809 shares included in column (c) are shares remaining under the 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors.  (4)  Equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners included in the table refers to the Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan. The Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan for highly compensated employees is an unfunded, non-tax qualified plan that provides benefits equal to the employee deferrals and company matching allocations that would have been provided under Honeywells U.S. tax-qualified savings plan if the Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and ##TABLE_END 99 ##TABLE_START    contributions did not apply. The Company matching contribution is credited to participants accounts in the form of notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of Common Stock. The number of shares to be issued under this plan based on the value of the notional shares as of December 31, 2018 is 328,003.  (5)  Column (b) does not include any exercise price for notional shares allocated to employees under Honeywells equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners because all of these shares are only settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis.  (6)  The amount of securities available for future issuance under the Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan is not determinable because the number of securities that may be issued under this plan depends upon the amount deferred to the plan by participants in future years. ##TABLE_END ", "13": " Item 13.
