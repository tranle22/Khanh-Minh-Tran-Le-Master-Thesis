Business ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START General ##TABLE_END Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon, or the Company) is one of the worlds leading providers of communications services. Formerly known as Bell Atlantic Corporation, we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We began doing business as Verizon Communications Inc. on June 30, 2000 following our merger with GTE Corporation. We completed the acquisition of Alltel Corporation (Alltel) on January 9, 2009, making Verizon the largest wireless service provider in the United States (U.S.) in terms of the total number of customers and revenues. Stressing diversity and commitment to the communities in which we operate, we have a highly diverse workforce of approximately 222,900 employees. Our principal executive offices are located at 140 West Street, New York, New York 10007 (telephone number 212-395-1000). We have two primary reportable segments, Domestic Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business segments and organize by products and services. These segments and principal activities consist of the following: ##TABLE_START Domestic Wireless  Domestic Wirelesss products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales across the U.S. Wireline  Wirelines communications products and services include voice, Internet access, broadband video and data, next generation Internet protocol (IP) network services, network access, long distance and other services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the U.S. and in 150 other countries around the world. ##TABLE_END The following portions of the 2009 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners are incorporated into this report: ##TABLE_START    Overview on pages 14 through 16; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Segment Results of Operations on pages 21 through 26 and in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 68 through 70; and, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Discontinued Operations and Extraordinary Item included in Consolidated Results of Operations on pages 20 through 21. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Domestic Wireless ##TABLE_END Background Our Domestic Wireless segment, Cellco Partnership doing business as Verizon Wireless (Verizon Wireless), is a joint venture formed in April 2000 by the combination of the U.S. wireless operations and interests of Verizon and Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone). Verizon owns a controlling 55% interest in Verizon Wireless, and Vodafone owns the remaining 45%. In 2009, Domestic Wireless revenues were $62,131 million, representing approximately 58% of Verizons aggregate revenues. Domestic Wireless is not dependent on any single customer. Alltel Acquisition and Integration On June 5, 2008, Verizon Wireless entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Alltel, a provider of wireless voice and data services to consumer and business customers in 34 states, and its controlling stockholder, Atlantis Holdings LLC, to acquire, in an all-cash merger, 100% of the equity of Alltel for cash consideration of $5.9 billion and the assumption of approximately $24 billion of aggregate principal amount of Alltel debt. Verizon Wireless closed the transaction on January 9, 2009. See  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Recent Developments in the 2009 Annual Report to Shareowners. As a condition of the regulatory approvals from the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that were required to complete the Alltel acquisition, Verizon Wireless is required to divest overlapping wireless properties in 105 operating markets in 24 states (Alltel Divestiture Markets). These markets consist primarily of Alltel operations, but also include a small number of pre-merger operations of Verizon Wireless. As a result of these divestiture requirements, we placed the wireless licenses and assets in the Alltel Divestiture Markets in a management trust that will continue to operate the properties under their current brands until they are sold. In May 2009, Verizon Wireless entered into a definitive agreement with ATT Mobility LLC (ATT Mobility), a subsidiary of ATT Inc. (ATT) pursuant to which ATT Mobility agreed to acquire 79 of the 105 Alltel Divestiture Markets, including licenses and network assets for approximately $2.4 billion in cash. In June 2009, Verizon Wireless entered into an agreement with Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. pursuant to which it agreed to acquire the remaining 26 Alltel Divestiture Markets that were not included in the transaction with ATT Mobility, including licenses and network assets for $200 million in cash. Verizon Wireless expects to close both transactions during the first half of 2010. Completion of each of the foregoing transactions is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals from the DOJ and the FCC. Substantially all of the Alltel markets that are not subject to divestiture have been re-branded to  Verizon Wireless . As a result of the acquisition of Alltel, we have experienced cost savings from reduced roaming costs, the elimination of duplicate facilities and reduced overall expenses relating to advertising, overhead and headcount. We also expect to experience reduced overall combined capital expenditures as a result of greater economies of scale and the redeployment of redundant network assets. Our network and Alltels network both employ code division multiple access (CDMA) technology, which is facilitating the integration of Alltels network operations with ours. We cannot, however, ensure that we will be able to achieve all of the anticipated cost savings and other benefits discussed above.  Operations Verizon Wireless provides wireless voice and data services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the U.S. and has the largest third generation (3G) network of any U.S. wireless service provider. Verizon Wireless is the industryleading wireless service provider in the U.S., in terms of operating income. With our acquisition of Alltel, Verizon Wireless became the largest wireless service provider in the United States, as measured by the total number of customers and revenues. Competition In the U.S., we compete primarily against three other national wireless service providers: ATT, Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile. In addition, in many markets we also compete with regional wireless service providers, such as U.S. Cellular, MetroPCS and Leap Wireless. We expect competition to intensify as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels, the development and deployment of new technologies, the introduction of new products and services, new market entrants, the availability of additional spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, and regulatory changes. Several higher-speed wireless technologies have been deployed by various wireless service providers, while others are in the process of being developed to meet the growing customer appetite for wireless communications in both fixed and fully mobile environments. We have deployed the largest 3G wireless network in the United States. Other wireless service providers are in various stages of deploying their own 3G networks, and fourth generation (4G) technologies are being developed and deployed. In addition, some municipalities and communications companies have been deploying networks of small Wi-Fi access points. Competition may also increase if smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized and more experienced wireless service providers. We also compete with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilities-based wireless service providers for resale. The wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services. Other participants in the wireless value chain, including data application and content providers and device manufacturers, are introducing products and services directly to wireless consumers, rather than through wireless service providers, in order to compete more effectively for wireless data revenues. Also, several device makers are making third-party applications and content available by bundling them with their products. For example, Apple Inc. is packaging software applications and content with its phones, and Google Inc. (Google) has developed an open operating system and related applications for mobile devices that has been deployed on phones that we and certain other wireless service providers currently offer. In addition, in January 2010, Google began selling its own branded phone directly to consumers via its web store. Third parties, such as Skype, are also now offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless providers voice service. We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry: ##TABLE_START   Network Reliability, Capacity and Coverage. We believe that a wireless network that consistently provides high quality and reliable service is a key differentiator in the U.S. market and a driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new data service offerings have led to increased customer usage of wireless services, which in turn impacts network capacity. In order to compete effectively, wireless service providers must keep pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through their networks. We believe that we have the nations most reliable wireless voice and data network. Third-party studies conducted in the fourth quarter of 2009 show that, on a percentage basis, we have the fewest dropped calls and the fewest ineffective attempts among the national wireless service providers in the 100 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas. We continue to look for opportunities to expand our network through the build-out of our existing spectrum and the acquisition of new operating markets. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Pricing . Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape, as evidenced by increases in the marketing of minutes-sharing plans, free mobile-to-mobile calling, offerings of larger bundles of included minutes at attractive price points with no roaming or long distance charges, calling group features that enable customers to place and receive calls from a group of U.S. phone numbers they designate (including domestic landline numbers) without the call time counting against their minute allotment, and both prepaid and postpaid plans offering unlimited voice and data usage. We seek to compete in this area by offering our customers services and equipment that they will regard as the best available value for the price, as well as service plans that meet their needs for both voice and data services. In January 2010, we launched a streamlined group of voice plans and data packages, including postpaid and prepaid plans with unlimited minutes and messaging, which provide our customers with simplified pricing options. We believe that this simplified approach will be attractive to our customers, drive greater adoption of data services and result in even higher customer satisfaction. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Customer Service . We believe that high quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and in attracting both new-to-wireless customers and customers of other wireless providers. We continually focus on enhancing our customer service. Our competitors also recognize the importance of customer service and are also focusing on improving the customer experience. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Product Development . As wireless technologies develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate, continued customer and revenue growth will be increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced products and services. We are committed to continuing to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative devices, products and services both independently and in collaboration with application service providers and device manufacturers, and to make available to our customers distinctive wireless devices and services that can access the growing array of data applications and content available over the Internet. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Sales and Distribution. Key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We believe that attaining the optimal mix of direct, indirect and wholesale distribution channels is important to achieving industry-leading profitability, as measured by operating income. We endeavor to increase sales through our company-operated stores, outside sales teams and telemarketing and web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, as well as through our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations and portable computer original equipment manufacturers. In addition, we have various resellers who buy our service on a wholesale basis. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START   Capital Resources. In order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services, wireless service providers require significant capital resources. ##TABLE_END Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry, including the factors described above, as well as new technologies, new business models, changes in customer preferences, regulatory changes, demographic trends, economic conditions, and pricing strategies of competitors. Network Our network is among the largest in the U.S., with licensed and operational coverage in all of the top 100 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas. Our network covers a population of approximately 290 million and provides service to our customer base of nearly 91.2 million, as of December 31, 2009. A key part of our business strategy is to provide the highest network reliability. We are focused on designing and deploying our network in a manner that we believe maximizes the number of calls that are connected and completed by our customers on the first attempt. We plan to continue to build out, expand and upgrade our network and explore strategic opportunities to expand our national network coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses. Our primary network technology platform is CDMA, based on spread-spectrum digital radio technology. CDMA-1XRTT technology is deployed in virtually all of our cell sites in our CDMA network. In addition, EV-DO, a third-generation packet-based technology intended primarily for high-speed data transmission, is deployed in approximately 94% of the cell sites in our CDMA network, as of December 31, 2009. Additional EV-DO deployment is ongoing, as is the integration of the Alltel portion of our network. We also provide GSM service and fulfill GSM roaming obligations in certain markets as a result of our purchases of Rural Cellular Corporation and Alltel. Our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service. Power and transport facilities can often become a networks vulnerability. Consequently, we have battery backup at every switch and virtually every cell site in our network. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our cell sites and at every switch location. We further ensure reliability by providing secondary transport facilities for critical links in the network. Competing wireless service providers have chosen GSM or other technologies as the technology platforms for their 3G networks. While we believe our 3G CDMA technology offers many advantages compared to GSM, such as more efficient spectrum usage and lower overall operating costs, GSM substantially leads in worldwide market share, affording its users certain scale advantages. In 2009, we continued to develop our fourth generation (4G) wireless broadband network using Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology. This new technology follows GSMs evolutionary path but is different from, and is expected to be an improvement upon, the previous generations of both GSM and CDMA-based digital radio technologies. LTE networks are designed to provide higher throughput performance and improved efficiencies for 4G wireless voice and data services. We plan to launch our LTE network in 25 to 30 markets in 2010, and to cover virtually all of our current 3G network footprint by the end of 2013. Many other major wireless service providers, both domestic and foreign, have also selected LTE as the technology for their 4G deployments and, in December 2009, one such provider, TeliaSonera, launched commercial LTE service in Norway and Sweden. We believe that LTE will provide us with the opportunity to adopt an access platform with global scale. Concurrent with ongoing LTE standards development, we are presently conducting tests of LTE technology with vendors. These tests are being conducted at several locations in the United States. In February 2009, we selected Ericsson and Alcatel-Lucent as primary network vendors for our initial LTE network deployments in the United States. We continue to conduct validation testing in conjunction with initial commercial deployments. We expect that technology testing and assessments will continue as the LTE technology and standards are advanced. We have also created the Verizon Wireless LTE Innovation Center, which we believe will serve as a catalyst for the early development of non-traditional products for use on LTE networks. The center will work with several of our strategic partners to help the consumer electronics industry quickly bring products to market. Open Development Program As part of our open development program intended to provide customers with the ability to use, on our network, devices and mobile applications that we do not sell, in 2008, we published the technical interface standards that the development community is using in order to design such devices. In August 2009, we published updated standards that developers will need to design such devices that can run on the LTE network that we plan to launch in 25 to 30 markets in 2010. In addition, we have certified three independent laboratories to perform testing of third-party devices to ensure that they conform to our technical interface standards in order to operate on our network. We believe that our open development program will spur innovation, expand customer choices and produce an array of new products for use on our network and, as a result, increase customer connections to our network. Since July 2008, we have certified numerous third-party devices to run on our network. Additionally, in August 2009, we consummated the formation of a joint venture company, nPhase, which we own equally with Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm). nPhase is expected to facilitate our provision of machine-to-machine wireless communications solutions to a variety of vertical market segments, including healthcare, manufacturing, utilities, distribution and consumer products.  Spectrum We have licenses to provide wireless services on portions of the 800 MHz and/or 1800-1900 MHz spectrum bands in areas where approximately 99% of the estimated U.S. population reside, as of December 31, 2009. We obtained our spectrum assets through FCC lotteries, auctions and allotments, and acquisitions from and exchanges with private parties. In parts of the U.S., we also have licenses for AWS spectrum in segments of the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands. In addition, in November 2008, the FCC granted us 109 licenses for portions of the 700 MHz band for which we were the winning bidder in FCC Auction 73. Certain of these licenses can be used to provide wireless service coverage to the entire population of the U.S. (except Alaska). The spectrum we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services, including text and multi-media messaging, location based services, machine-to-machine services and broadband Internet access. We plan to use the AWS and 700 MHz spectrum mainly for advanced broadband wireless services utilizing LTE technology. When combined, the various bands described above give us a national average spectrum depth of approximately 88 MHz, as of December 31, 2009. We anticipate that we will need additional spectrum in a limited number of our markets to meet future demand. We can meet spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses if and when offered by the FCC in future spectrum auctions. The availability of new spectrum for commercial wireless services and the possible dates of future FCC spectrum auctions are unknown at this time. As we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and have spectrum surpluses in others, we have at times arranged spectrum swaps, and we expect to have opportunities to use the beneficial trading of spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future, subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses in each instance. Wireless Offerings We believe that increasing the value of our service offerings to customers will help us to retain our existing customers, attract new customers and increase customer usage, all of which will, in turn drive revenue and operating income growth. In January 2010, we launched a streamlined group of new voice plans, including postpaid and prepaid plans with unlimited minutes and messaging, which provide our customers with simplified pricing options that we believe they will find attractive. As part of this launch, we also introduced simplified tiered data packages of varying sizes for our postpaid plans  unlimited usage, required for customers using our 3G smartphones; a 25-megabyte package required for users of our 3G multimedia phones; and usage on a pay-per-megabyte basis for users of our simple feature phones. Both our 3G multimedia phone and simple feature phone users have the option of upgrading to a higher tier data package. Wireless Services Voice services. We offer a variety of postpaid plans for voice services and features with competitive pricing. Approximately 90% of our customers received our voice services on a retail postpaid basis, as of December 31, 2009. Specifically, we offer: Nationwide Calling Plans for individual customers, which provide a choice, at varying price points, of differently sized bundles of minutes of use or unlimited minutes; Nationwide Family SharePlans and Nationwide Small Business SharePlans designed for multiple-line accounts; and Nationwide Business Plans targeted to business accounts with over 100 lines and national accounts with over 1,000 lines. All of these nationwide postpaid plans include, among other things, Mobile to Mobile Calling, which enables the customer to place calls to, or receive calls from, any other Verizon Wireless customer mobile number without the call time counting against their minute allotment, night and weekend minute allowances, no domestic long distance charges and no domestic roaming charges for calls placed within the customers coverage area. In addition, these plans also include access to the Internet through our Mobile Web service for an additional charge per megabyte sent or received, depending upon the customers data package. Several of our voice plan offerings include data service features, such as unlimited text, picture, video and instant messaging to any mobile number on any network in the U.S. In addition, in 2009, we launched Friends  Family , which is available to our consumer and business customers on many of our Nationwide Calling Plans. Friends  Family allows customers, depending upon their calling plan, to place calls to, and receive calls from, 5 to 10 U.S. phone numbers they designate that are not part of the Verizon Wireless network (including domestic landline numbers) without the call time counting against their minute allotment. In addition, beginning in March 2010, our customers using select 3G smartphones will be able to download Skype mobile, an application exclusive to Verizon Wireless. Skype mobile will enable these customers to make and receive unlimited Skype voice calls and send and receive instant messages, while within the U.S., to and from other Skype users anywhere in the world without these calls or messages counting against the customers minute allotment or incurring data charges. Skype mobile will also enable these customers to make international calls to non-Skype users at competitive Skype calling rates. We also offer Push to Talk, a walkie-talkie style voice service that is available on specialized phones as an add-on feature for an additional monthly charge. Prepaid offerings . We also offer our Verizon Wireless Prepaid service that enables individuals to obtain wireless voice services without a long-term contract or credit verification by paying in advance. All of our Verizon Wireless Prepaid plans include Mobile to Mobile Calling. In addition, our Verizon Wireless Prepaid customers can also access certain of our key data services and offerings, such as our Mobile Web services, Ringtones and Ringback Tones, V CAST and VZ Navigator , for additional fees. Data services. We believe that we are in a strong position to take advantage of the growing demand for wireless data services. Our strategy is to continue to expand our wireless data offerings for both consumer and business customers. We offer an array of data services and applications, such as: ##TABLE_START   Text and Picture Messaging Services. With compatible wireless devices, our text and picture messaging service enables our customers to send and receive text messages, enhanced messages with animations and graphics as well as still pictures, voice, and full-motion video clips with sound.

VZEmail offers a suite of products that enables wireless e-mail across our diverse portfolio of wireless devices. In addition, our Wireless Office suite of services offers our business customers with at least 50 lines of service, through the use of their existing wireless devices, calling features traditionally associated with landline/PBX phones, such as abbreviated dialing. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Location-Based Services . We offer several location-based services targeted to consumer and business customers. For example, our VZ Navigator application enables customers to obtain audible turn-by-turn directions to their destination, locate points of interest, receive real-time traffic alerts with re-routing instructions, and access other location-related information by using VZ Navigator -capable phones. Our Family Locator service, available on certain of our phones, provides our Family SharePlan customers with the ability to locate the wireless phone of other Family SharePlan customers in their plan by accessing the Internet via a computer or by using a Family Locator-enabled wireless phone. Field Force Manager, targeted to our business customers, is a location-based mobile resource management tool that provides businesses with the ability to locate, monitor and communicate with their mobile field workers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Telematics Services. Telematics generally involves the integration of wireless services into private and commercial vehicles, often incorporating both a voice and data capability. Telematics services include navigation assistance, roadside and emergency notification services, concierge services and stolen vehicle tracking. We support telematics services for some of the largest automotive manufacturers, and we are currently the national provider of wireless service for OnStar, a subsidiary of General Motors Company. We do not currently include telematics customers in our customer count. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Telemetry Services . Telemetry generally refers to services that are characterized by machine-to-machine interactions that do not include a voice component. With telemetry services, data transmissions are used by customers to monitor stationary equipment, such as residential and commercial security systems, and the remote monitoring of control equipment in a wide variety of industries. ##TABLE_END We have also undertaken initiatives that we believe will increase the number and accessibility of data applications available to our customers. These initiatives include our open development program described above, as well as the following: ##TABLE_START    In June 2009 we joined the Joint Innovation Lab (JIL), a joint venture whose other participants are China Mobile Limited, SOFTBANK Corp. and Vodafone International Holdings B.V. JILs initial focus is to develop a single global software platform that will allow developers to create mobile applications that can run on multiple operating systems. These applications, referred to as widgets, can enhance both the functionality of certain wireless devices and the mobile Internet experience. These applications will have the potential to reach the JIL participants nearly 1 billion customers worldwide. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    In July 2009, we hosted our first Verizon Developer Community conference to foster the development of new mobile applications. The conference provided developers with information on our applications platform and programming interfaces, billing and revenue sharing to enable developers to bring applications to market quickly. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    In October 2009, we announced the creation of the 4G Venture Forum, whose members include Verizon Wireless, Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson and several venture capital funds. The forum will enable 4G-related innovations to get to market faster by providing developers and other participants in the 4G ecosystem with funding and development assistance, technical viability assessments and vital strategic input from forum members. ##TABLE_END International Services We offer a variety of international wireless services targeted to the needs of our customers ranging from our multinational business accounts to our consumer customers who occasionally travel outside of the U.S. Through our roaming arrangements with certain wireless service providers outside of the U.S., customers enrolled in our international dialing service can use any of our phones in more than 40 international destinations that provide CDMA wireless service, with data services available in more than 20 such destinations.

In addition, we sell several netbooks, which are portable wireless computers, smaller than traditional laptop computers, which can access the Internet via our Mobile Broadband service. Suppliers and Product Supply Chain We purchase wireless devices and accessory products from a number of manufacturers, with the substantial majority of our purchases made from LG Electronics, Samsung, Motorola, RIM, Palm, PCD, Pantech, HTC and Nokia. A key component of all wireless phones is the chipset, which contains the intelligence of the phone. Most of our phone suppliers rely on Qualcomm for manufacturing and supplying CDMA-1XRTT and EV-DO chipsets. We do, however, sell phones that include CDMA-1XRTT chipsets manufactured by VIA Telecom, under license from Qualcomm. In addition, there are a number of other components common to wireless phones provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly. We depend upon a number of key suppliers and, if any of them fail to fulfill their obligations to us, we may not be able to provide services or maintain and upgrade our network. We have developed relationships with New Breed Logistics, Inc., and Communications Test Design, Inc., for our phone and other product warehousing, distribution and direct customer fulfillment. We do not own a significant product warehousing and distribution infrastructure. Our primary cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are Alcatel-Lucent, which provides more than half of our cell site equipment, Motorola and Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (Ericsson), which together currently provide nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment. Until November 2009, Nortel provided us with the cell site equipment now provided by Ericsson. In January 2009, Nortel and certain of its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States and Canada. In connection with this bankruptcy, in November 2009 the Nortel business unit that supplies CDMA wireless infrastructure to us was sold to Ericsson. We also rely upon Alcatel-Lucent, Motorola and, as a result of the above-mentioned sale, Ericsson for substantially all of our switching equipment. Marketing We focus our marketing strategy on offering solutions that are targeted to satisfy the needs of our various customer market segments, such as young adults, seniors, families and small to large businesses; promoting our brand; leveraging our extensive distribution network; and cross-marketing with Verizons other business units and Vodafone. Our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television, print, radio, outdoor signage, Internet and point-of-sale media promotions, which ensures that our marketing message is consistently presented across all of our markets. Our promotion of the Verizon Wireless brand is complemented by Verizons other brand marketing activities, reinforcing the awareness of our services in shared markets and capitalizing on the size and breadth of Verizon Communications customer base.  Sales and Distribution Channels We utilize a mix of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs. Our direct distribution channel includes our company-operated stores, a core component of our distribution strategy. Our experience has been that customers that we obtain through this direct channel are less likely to cancel their service than those we obtain through indirect channels. As of December 31, 2009, we operated approximately 2,300 company-operated stores and kiosks. We will continue to evaluate all of our stores to ensure that they are optimally located in accordance with our distribution objectives. As of December 31, 2009, we ceased operating approximately 335 stores located in the Alltel markets that we are not required to divest. Certain other stores may be transitioned to local agents for their marketing of our products and services. Our direct channel also includes our business-to-business operations and systems organization, which is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of our local, regional and national business customers, as well as a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers. In October 2009, we announced the creation of a dedicated organization to more effectively serve the needs of our large multinational corporate customers and our government accounts. This organization is focused on delivering to these customers integrated, industry-specific solutions to meet their telecommunications needs. We also offer fully-automated, end-to-end web-based sales of wireless phones, accessories and service in all of our markets. Our indirect retail channel consists of agents that sell our postpaid and/or prepaid wireless products and services at their retail locations throughout the U.S. In addition, national retailers, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Costco and Target, sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services. We also sell wireless capacity on a wholesale basis, which involves the sale of wholesale access, minutes and data services to independent companies that resell wireless services to end-users. Our ability to attract new subscribers and our revenue could be adversely affected if our relationship with any of our national indirect distributors were terminated or if they shifted the mix of their business to favor other wireless service providers. Customer Service, Retention and Satisfaction We believe that high quality customer service is a key differentiator because it increases customer satisfaction and reduces customer churn, the rate at which customers disconnect individual lines of service. Therefore, satisfying and retaining existing customers is critical to the financial performance of wireless service providers and an essential element of our strategy. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services, in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. Third-party studies conducted in 2009 show that we placed highest in overall customer satisfaction among the national wireless service providers. While our customer service representatives are available during our normal business hours, we also have representatives available 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week to assist with emergency and technical customer issues. In addition, customers can do business with us at any time, without having to speak with a customer service representative, through our enhanced self-service applications, which include our interactive voice response system, through our website, and via applications accessible from customer handsets. Under our enhanced Worry Free Guarantee, a national customer retention and loyalty initiative, we have committed to providing our customers with an extensive and advanced network, responsive customer service with end-to-end resolution, the option to change at any time to any qualifying wireless service plan without paying any additional fees or requiring any contract extension, an early termination fee that decreases after each full month that a customer remains on their contract, and a handset upgrade credit every two years, provided that the customer signs a new two-year contract for a calling plan with at least a $35 monthly access charge. In addition, our My Verizon Advantage program offers each customer who registers with our My Verizon website free back-up protection for the customers phone contact list, an annual handset upgrade option for qualified customers and periodic notification if the customer exceeds his or her plan allowance. Another significant retention and loyalty program is the customer lifecycle management program in which we contact customers at key times during the customer relationship about targeted offers and to provide proactive rate plan analysis.  ##TABLE_START Wireline ##TABLE_END Background The Wireline segment provides customers with communications products and services that include voice, Internet access, broadband video and data, next generation IP network services, network access, long distance and other services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the U.S. and in 150 other countries around the world. In 2009, we changed the manner in which the Wireline segment reports Operating revenues to align our financial presentation to the continued evolution of the wireline business. Accordingly, there are four revenue-producing lines of business within the Wireline segment: Mass Markets, Global Enterprise, Global Wholesale and Other. In 2009, Wireline revenues were $46,080 million, representing approximately 43% of Verizons aggregate revenues. Our Wireline segment is not dependent on any single customer. Access Line Spin-off On May 13, 2009, we announced plans to spin off a newly formed subsidiary of Verizon (Spinco) to our stockholders. Spinco will hold defined assets and liabilities of the local exchange business and related landline activities of Verizon in Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin, and in portions of California bordering Arizona, Nevada and Oregon, including Internet access and long distance services and broadband video provided to designated customers in those areas. Immediately following the spin-off, Spinco plans to merge with Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) pursuant to a definitive agreement with Frontier, and Frontier will be the surviving corporation. The transactions do not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The merger will result in Frontier acquiring approximately 4 million access lines and certain related businesses from Verizon, which collectively generated annual revenues of approximately $4 billion for Verizon's Wireline segment. Depending on the trading prices of Frontier common stock prior to the closing of the merger, Verizon stockholders will collectively own between approximately 66% and 71% of Frontiers outstanding equity immediately following the closing of the merger, and Frontier stockholders will collectively own between approximately 29% and 34% of Frontiers outstanding equity immediately following the closing of the merger (in each case, before any closing adjustments). The actual number of shares of common stock to be issued by Frontier in the merger will be calculated based upon several factors, including the average trading price of Frontier common stock during a pre-closing measuring period (subject to a collar) and other closing adjustments. Verizon will not own any shares of Frontier after the merger. Both the spin-off and merger are expected to qualify as tax-free transactions, except to the extent that cash is paid to Verizon stockholders in lieu of fractional shares. In connection with the spin-off, Verizon expects to receive from Spinco approximately $3.3 billion in value through a combination of a special cash payment to Verizon, a reduction in Verizons consolidated indebtedness, and, in certain circumstances, the issuance to Verizon of debt securities of Spinco. In the merger, Verizon stockholders are expected to receive approximately $5.3 billion of Frontier common stock, assuming the average trading price of Frontier common stock during the pre-closing measuring period is within the collar and no closing adjustments. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including receipt of state and federal telecommunications regulatory approvals. If the conditions are satisfied, we expect this transaction to close during the second quarter of 2010. Operations Mass Markets Mass Markets operations provide local exchange (basic service and end-user access), long distance (including regional toll), broadband services (including high-speed Internet and FiOS Internet) and FiOS TV services to residential and small business subscribers. In partnership with DIRECTV, Verizon also offers satellite television service to enable double- and triple-play offers in non-FiOS markets. In 2009, Mass Markets revenues were $19,755 million, representing approximately 43% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. To differentiate the FiOS platform from its competitors, initiatives are under way to leverage this technology to deliver video applications, widgets, and interactivity with television, including access to social networking sites, and access to Internet video sites. Global Enterprise Global Enterprise offers voice, data and Internet communications services to medium and large business customers, multi-national corporations, and state and federal government customers. We offer communications and IT solutions, combining professional expertise with extensive IP networks to deliver communications, IT, information security and network solutions. We securely connect today's extended enterprises with their wide-spread customers, partners, suppliers and highly mobile employeesenabling them to increase productivity, efficiency and the speed at which they conduct business. In addition to traditional voice and data services, Global Enterprise offers managed and advanced products and solutions through our strategic services. This encompasses our focus areas of growth, including IP services and value-added solutions that make communications more secure, reliable and efficient. Global Enterprise also provides managed network services for customers that outsource all or portions of their communications and information processing operations and data services such as private IP, private line, frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) services, both domestically and internationally. Over 80% of our frame relay customers have converted to private IP. Customers can now choose an on-demand consumption model for their infrastructure as a service rather than installing and configuring dedicated environments. In addition, Global Enterprise offers professional services in more than 30 countries around the world, supporting a range of solutions including network services, managing a move to IP-based unified communications and providing application performance support. In 2009, Global Enterprise revenues were $14,988 million, representing approximately 32% of Wirelines aggregate revenues.  Global Wholesale Global Wholesale offers switched access and special access services primarily to long distance and other carriers who use our facilities to provide services to their customers. Switched access revenues are generated from fixed and usage-based charges paid by carriers for access to our local network, interexchange wholesale traffic sold in the United States, as well as internationally destined traffic that originates in the U.S. Special access revenues are generated from carriers that buy dedicated local exchange capacity to support their private networks. Global Wholesale services also include local wholesale revenues from unbundled network elements and interconnection revenues from competitive local exchange carriers and wireless carriers. A portion of Global Wholesale revenues is generated by a few large telecommunication companies, many of whom compete directly with us. In 2009, Global Wholesale revenues were $9,637 million, representing approximately 21% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. Major initiatives that are under way, such as Fiber-to-the-cell sites, global data growth, an increased focus on high-yield international voice routes and the development of new segments, will further differentiate Global Wholesale from its competitors. As consumer demand for smartphones and bandwidth intensive applications grow, wireless carriers are looking for network solutions to carry increasing volumes of traffic. Our service allows virtually unlimited capacity and enables wireless carriers to offer next generation applications to their customers. We have constructed more than 2,300 cell sites in 2009 with fiber Ethernet service across most carriers and we are on track to fully support Verizon Wireless LTE launch in 2010. Global Wholesale will also continue to capitalize on voice traffic growth to high-yield destinations where we have volume (minutes) going to key destinations around the globe. New opportunities are being driven by machine-to-machine applications, managed services, and digital content which provide more value to our customers and represent the largest growth opportunities. Global Wholesales initiatives are focused on providing value and targeting these growth services. Other Other services include such services as local exchange and long distance services from former MCI mass market customers, operator services, pay phone, card services and supply sales, as well as dial around services including 10-10-987, 10-10-220, 1-800-COLLECT and prepaid cards. In 2009, Other revenues were $1,700 million, representing approximately 4% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. Competition The wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify further with traditional, non-traditional and emerging players seeking increased market share. Current and potential competitors include cable companies, wireless service providers, other domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, Internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. Companies with a global presence provide a threat to the Wireline segment. Customers, particularly in the Global Enterprise and, to a lesser extent, Global Wholesale, looking for reach and access around the world, can look to a handful of telecommunications and integrated service providers that operate globally. These full (or near-full) service providers serve as competitors in our efforts to win large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have a strong market presence, brand recognition, and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition and which may affect our future revenue growth. In the Global Enterprise business, the customers need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is driving the expansion of the competitive landscape. Major competitors include system integrators, carriers, hardware and software providers. Some of the biggest companies in IT services are either making acquisitions or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending. Most new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing, software delivery, communication applications and other computing tasks via the network rather than on in-house machines. Carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been the well-defended turf of the major IT outsourcers. We believe that cable operators represent a significant threat to our Wireline business. Cable operators have increased the size and digital capacity of their networks so that they can offer digital products and services. We continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include high-speed Internet access, digital television and voice services. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. Wireless substitution is an ongoing competitive trend, which we expect to continue as wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from companies that provide Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. These services use the Internet or private broadband networks to transmit voice communications. VoIP services are available from a wide range of companies including cable companies, and national and regional providers. Internet portal providers are also entering our competitive space. As a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which requires us to allow potential competitors to purchase our services for resale, or access components of our network on an unbundled basis at a prescribed cost, competition in our local exchange markets continues. Our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to competitive local exchange carriers at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers. The scope of these obligations going forward and the rates we receive, are subject to ongoing review and revision by the FCC and state regulators. See Regulatory and Competitive Trends in the 2009 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners. Global Wholesale competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. Additionally, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity.  Carriers continue to strategically invest capital to build their networks further into our franchise markets. Consolidation continues to create opportunities  it has helped to strengthen the wholesale market by decreasing the number of competitors and contributing to price stabilization. The landscape for wholesale services is also constantly changing, and is driving new requirements, and the nature of these relationships can quickly move from a retail model to a wholesale model. We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry: ##TABLE_START   Customer Service : Customers expect industry leading service from their service providers. As technologies and services evolve, the requirement of the carrier to excel in this area is crucial for customer retention. Providing exceptional service to our customers builds integrity in Verizon across the marketplace. Residential customers experience this through our service representatives and online support, recently recognized as industry leading by an independent survey organization. Our award-winning Verizon Enterprise Center provides our business customers with ready access to their system and performance information. Proactive testing of the network helps identify minor issues before they become significant, allowing us to fix them before the customer even notices. We expect that our customer service will be a key differentiator in the Enterprise business. In a 2009 annual study, J.D. Power and Associates determined that Verizon is the top performer in overall satisfaction in the Large Enterprise segment. In the Wholesale business, service improvement can be achieved through continued system automation initiatives. Our online tools allow customers to interface with their provisioning and maintenance transactions electronically, improving self-service and further differentiating us from other service providers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Network reliability and bandwidth (speed): As both consumers and small business customers look to leverage high speed connections for entertainment, communications, and productivity, we expect broadband penetration will continue to increase over the next several years. As online and online-enabled activities increase, so will bandwidth requirements, both downstream and upstream. To succeed, we and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can deliver against these increasing bandwidth requirements. We are continuing to build out our network to be able to meet this future demand. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Pricing : Cable and telecommunications companies and integrated service providers use pricing to capture market share from incumbents. Pricing is also significant as non-traditional modes of providing communication services emerge and new entrants compete for customers. For example, portal-based and VoIP calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Product differentiation : As a result of pricing pressures, providers need to differentiate their products. Customers are shifting from an access to an applications mindset and are focused on how they can leverage their broadband and video connections. Converged features, such as integrated wireless and wireline functionality, are becoming similarly important, enabled by both customer demand and technological advancement. ##TABLE_END Network Our business strategy is to be the premier broadband and entertainment service provider in the mass market. Network reliability is also a key component of our business strategy. We are executing on this strategy by deploying Fiber-to-the-premise (FTTP) access technologies over fiber optic cables. FTTP provides the highest possible bandwidth to the customer premise, based on current technology and allows us the flexibility to adapt our facilities more easily to future product development. New optical terminals can be added to the FTTP network, providing greater bandwidth and new services without any additional field construction. As we continue to expand our deployment of the most advanced Fiber Optic Network we are enhancing it with Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) technology. GPON technology will continue to support the services we offer today, while allowing for the introduction of new services through improved downstream and upstream capacity. In conjunction with the evolution of our access plant, we are also transitioning our metro (local) network infrastructure from traditional time division multiplexing (TDM)/SONET (Synchronous Optical Network)/ATM technologies to Ethernet over Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM). In 2009 we continued to deploy Reconfigurable Optic Add Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) nodes in the transport network. As a result, the new optical transport network provides features optimized for video distribution services and high speed data services, while maintaining the level of network reliability achieved with SONET. To fully leverage this new network infrastructure and allow for the more efficient sharing of our network across services, we are upgrading our multiplexing and routing infrastructure to use IP, Ethernet and MPLS (Multi Protocol Label Switching) technologies. In addition, we are migrating from traditional TDM-based voice switching to VoIP. This migration lowers the cost of current data and voice services and creates a network which can offer future multi-media communications services by adding service platforms without requiring widespread network upgrades. In keeping with our strategy of leading in network reliability, our service infrastructure utilizes our managed Quality of Service-enabled resilient IP network rather than the public Internet. We have been focused on growing our Ethernet infrastructure to support the full range of Ethernet private line and E-LAN services locally, domestically and globally. To lower the access cost and provide significant service flexibility, we are using a converged packet access strategy that replaces the private circuit-based customer access and aggregates traffic from multiple customers onto a shared Ethernet and MPLS network. We have also focused on the expansion of the private IP network (PIP) to serve all key international markets with managed Quality of Service-aware IP Virtual Private Network (VPN) services. Our Public IP network is now interconnected to PIP through Security Gateway platforms that allow business customers to extend the reach of their private virtual networks to off-net sites, such as employees homes, small branch offices and mobile work forces. These enhancements extend our IP services reach across the globe. We continue to focus on emerging optical transport technologies and expansion of our network to lower overall cost. We are integrating Ethernet, SONET and Optics, and Ultra-Long-Haul technologies. In addition, we have deployed a new, next generation undersea cable technology through the Trans-Pacific Express (TPE) connecting the west coast of the U.S. to China, Korea and Taiwan.  We continue to widen and deepen our global scope and capabilities. We have expanded our Virtual Private LAN service to Europe, Asia-Pacific, and additional North American locations. We also deployed the industrys first commercial 100G (gigabits per second) ultra-long-haul optical system for live traffic on our European optical core network; added a Japan landing to our TPE submarine cable system; and installed 106 private IP edge routers for a total of 753 edge routers in 212 sites in 59 countries. Wireline Offerings Mass Markets Our strategy is to be the customers first choice for communications and entertainment services. To achieve this we offer a variety of services at different price points. Video Services. We offer FiOS TV and Verizons fiber-optic video service and market a variety of DIRECTV packages that are delivered over satellite systems. FiOS TV provides access to more than 565 all-digital channels and more than 125 high definition channels and now is available to approximately 11.7 million homes across 14 states: New York, New Jersey, California, Delaware, Texas, Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Massachusetts, Virginia, Rhode Island, Oregon and Washington. Innovative features that we believe differentiate FiOS TV from the competition include: ##TABLE_START    Channel Line-up  We designed the channel line-up for ease of use, grouping channels by category. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    High Definition Content  We offer up to 125 channels in high definition with digital sound (Dolby 5.1). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Video on Demand  We offer monthly access to as many as 18,000 movies and shows via subscription, transactional and free on-demand programming, including 2,800 in high definition video on demand. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Interactive Media Guide  Our FiOS TV guide helps customers quickly and easily find content from television listings, video on demand catalogs and their own personal music and photo files. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Home Media DVR  Our multi-room digital video recorder, which allows recording in one room and viewing in another, also includes the Interactive Media Guide. The device also provides customers with the flexibility of moving content seamlessly from the PC/laptop to the wide screen for a richer viewing experience of user-generated content such as videos and photos. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    FiOS TV Widgets  Viewers get one-touch, on demand access to local weather, traffic and community information and increasingly popular social media applications such as Facebook and Twitter. We are expanding widget capabilities to support online commerce and recently launched a Home Shopping Network widget that enables purchases via remote control; we are in discussion with other companies to pursue similar revenue-sharing opportunities. The widget platform has evolved to an open-development environment, inviting third parties to capture opportunities for enhanced customer features via the FiOS TV product. Gaming is another key opportunity that will be enabled through the widgets platform. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Personalized Settings and Controls  Customers can control the content received on their televisions. ##TABLE_END Data Services. We offer high speed Internet and FiOS broadband data products with varying downstream and upstream processing speeds. In 2009, we saw increased demand for upstream bandwidth to support video and photo sharing in a secure environment. We also enhanced our FiOS offerings by increasing availability of our symmetrical FiOS Internet service with upload speeds of up to 20Mbps, as well as 50Mbps for download service. Our data packages include technical support, anti-virus and spam protection and e-mail online storage. Voice Services. We offer packages that include local exchange, regional, long distance, VoIP, wire maintenance and voice messaging services. In 2009, we continued to offer new calling plans and to bundle landline and wireless services with calling features and unlimited calling between a customers home phone and wireless handset, all on a single bill. Global Enterprise We are well positioned to take advantage of economic and technological trends. With a strong global IP network and robust service portfolio, we are able to assist customers with their transition to next generation services.

We offer a comprehensive portfolio of voice, data, value-added business and local telecommunications services to a wide array of customers, including: inter-exchange carriers, resellers, cable service operators, Internet service providers, network and systems integrators, and content data network providers. Voice Services. We offer regional access, VoIP services, and long distance services both domestically and internationally. We are a leading provider of international voice services across the world, serving customers on six continents and in over 150 countries. In 2010, we will focus on increasing international voice traffic on key high-yield routes. In addition, we offer interconnection services for local and wireless service providers who need to terminate traffic in our networks to reach their end users and subscribers. Data Services. We offer a robust portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance wholesale customer networks and to provide connections to their end users and subscribers. Our data services include: private line special access, fast packet, optical, Ethernet and IP services, each available in multiple options and configurations to support the complex needs of our customers. Our wireless customers in the U.S. represent the largest growth opportunity in wholesale, as they are significantly building up backhaul connections from their cell sites back to mobile switching centers. At the same time, they are migrating networks from TDM to Ethernet, which will better scale and service the growth of broadband services driven by smartphones, mobile broadband and mobile video. Global Wholesale offers a Fiber-tothe-Cell program, where we deliver to customers a wide array of Ethernet services, fiber network transport and support their expansion of 3G networks and roll-out of 4G technology. In addition, we offer an IP partner port service that allows content owners to connect to our network in a more efficient manner, as they deliver content across the Internet to subscribers, including our Mass Markets FiOS customers. In 2010, we plan to expand the partner port offer internationally to increase global customer connections into the U.S., furthering our efforts to grow data revenues globally. Value Added Business Services. Global Wholesale offers value-added business services, leveraging many of the same offers available in the Enterprise portfolio. Value-added services can enhance the customers experience with us by providing a more feature-rich service offering beyond traditional transport services. Several wholesale customers also serve large enterprises across the globe, and we can deliver value-added business services in a wholesale model to simplify these customers corporate telecommunications and IT needs including: ##TABLE_START    Managed Services  Offers wholesale customers the opportunity to outsource the management of their networks, security, remote access, and web applications to Verizon. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Mobility  Enables wholesale customers to complement their portfolio to triple-play or quad-play capability, by leveraging wireless devices and services offered through Verizon Wireless, and packaged and resold under their own carrier brand. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Security  Provides wholesale customers integrated solutions to help their enterprise end users secure their networks and data. ##TABLE_END Local Services.

Risk Factors ##TABLE_END The following discussion of Risk Factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations. Unfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the U.S. or in one or more of our other major markets, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining products and services under lower-cost programs offered by other companies. Similarly, under these conditions the business customers that we serve in the U.S. and abroad may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We face significant competition that may reduce our market share and lower our profits. We face significant competition in our industry. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated the traditional distinctions between local, long distance, wireless, cable and Internet communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, application and device providers, electric utilities, and providers of VoIP services. While these changes have enabled us to offer new types of services, they have also allowed other service providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our services and equipment, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends and economic conditions. We are subject to more regulation and have higher cost structures than many of our competitors, due in part to the presence of a unionized workforce and a large retiree population in our wireline business. In addition, while the workforce of our wireless business is almost entirely non-union, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact of such labor organizing on our costs. Accordingly, our competitors may be able to profitably offer services at lower prices. The resulting pressure on the price of services we provide may result in reduced revenues and profits. If we are not able to take advantage of technological developments in the telecommunications industry on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in a demand for our services or may be unable to implement our business strategy. Our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, to enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers changing demands. If we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. In general, the development of new services in our industry requires us to anticipate and respond to the varied and continually changing demands of our customers. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints to our introduction of new services. If these services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. For example, we have selected Long Term Evolution technology (LTE) as our next-generation wireless network access technology. We expect this new technology to enable us to offer a mobile data network with higher speeds and improved efficiencies. Other wireless service providers have announced their plans to adopt LTE as their next-generation technology, and we believe that it will become the principal next-generation global standard. There are risks, however, that these other wireless service providers may delay their deployment of LTE or change their selection and adopt different next-generation technologies, including technologies that are incompatible with ours. As a result, LTE may not become the principal next-generation global standard and may not provide us with the global scale, compatibility and other benefits that we expect in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our ability to deploy LTE on our network successfully and in a timely manner depends on various factors that are beyond our control, including the risk that our suppliers may be unable to manufacture and deliver LTE devices and network equipment on schedule and according to our specifications. Furthermore, our deployment of LTE may not occur, or occur at the cost we have estimated. If these risks materialize, our ability to provide next generation wireless services to our customers, to retain and attract customers, and to maintain and grow our customer revenues could be materially adversely affected. We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. We depend upon various key suppliers and vendors to provide us with the equipment that we need to operate our business. If these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service to us on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide services to our customers in a competitive manner or continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. Because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry. We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology. Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict our ability to operate in or provide specified products or services in designated areas, require that we maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are frequently involved in regulatory proceedings related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our provision of retail or wholesale services, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Unless we are able to obtain appropriate relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful at obtaining the licenses we need to carry out our business strategy or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years that are subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our wireless business, results of operations and financial condition. The adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal or state level could also adversely affect our business plans. New regulations could restrict the ways in which we can manage our wireline and wireless networks, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. For example, the development of new technologies, such as Internet Protocol-based services, including VoIP and super high-speed broadband and video, could be subject to conflicting regulation between the FCC and various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology. In addition, the FCC has several proceedings pending that are considering the imposition of additional requirements on wireline and wireless services. For instance, on October 22, 2009, the FCC initiated a proceeding in which it proposes to adopt so-called net neutrality rules that it describes as intended to preserve the openness of the Internet. The proposed rules would limit the ways that a broadband Internet access service provider could manage its network and the services it could provide over the network. These restrictions would include limitations related to devices that could connect to the network, services and applications provided over the network and priority of traffic moving over the network. The proposed rules would apply to all providers of broadband Internet access services, whether wireline or wireless, but would not apply to providers of applications, content or other services, including many companies with which we compete in the marketplace. If final rules are adopted that limit our flexibility in managing our broadband networks and delivering broadband services, these rules could have a significant adverse effect on our broadband business, restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our broadband networks. Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. With approximately 222,900 employees and approximately 213,000 retirees participating in Verizons benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors including increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in costs associated with our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. The federal government has been considering various proposals for legislation to reform the U.S. healthcare system. There are also various healthcare reform proposals being considered at the state level. While we cannot predict with certainty which healthcare reform initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the federal or state level, such regulation may have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, or our funding commitments. Natural or man-made disasters could have an adverse effect on our business. Natural disasters, terrorist acts, acts of war, cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security may cause equipment failures or disrupt our operations. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share to other communications providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets similar to those of recent years could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could affect our access to financing.  We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. Our business faces a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. If we are not able to successfully integrate Alltel into our business, we may not achieve all of the anticipated benefits of this acquisition. We have realized certain benefits from the Alltel acquisition, including increased revenues, market penetration in Alltels service areas, expansion of our network footprint and certain operating efficiencies and synergies. As we continue our integration efforts, we may face challenges, such as the combination and simplification of product and service offerings, customer plans and sales and marketing approaches, and the development and deployment of next generation wireless technology across the combined network. If we do not successfully meet these various challenges and continue to integrate Alltel in a timely and cost effective manner, we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and our financial results may be adversely affected. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

A portion of our property is subject to the liens of their respective mortgages securing funded debt.  Capital Expenditures We continue to make significant capital expenditures to meet the demand for communications services and to further improve such services. Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, were as follows: ##TABLE_START     (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31,  2009  2008  2007 Domestic Wireless  $ 7,152  $ 6,510  $ 6,503 Wireline   8,892   9,797   10,956 Other   1,003   931   79     $ 17,047  $ 17,238  $ 17,538    ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ", "3": " Item 3. Legal Proceedings ##TABLE_END Verizon, and a number of other telecommunications companies, have been the subject of multiple class action suits concerning its alleged participation in intelligence-gathering activities allegedly carried out by the federal government, at the direction of the President of the United States, as part of the governments post-September 11 program to prevent terrorist attacks. Plaintiffs generally allege that Verizon has participated by permitting the government to gain access to the content of its subscribers telephone calls and/or records concerning those calls and that such action violates federal and/or state constitutional and statutory law. Relief sought in the cases includes injunctive relief, attorneys fees, and statutory and punitive damages. On August 9, 2006, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (Panel) ordered that these actions be transferred, consolidated and coordinated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The Panel subsequently ordered that a number of tag along actions also be transferred to the Northern District of California. Verizon believes that these lawsuits are without merit. On July 10, 2008, the President signed into law the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which provides for dismissal of these suits by the court based on submission by the Attorney General of the United States of a specified certification. On September 19, 2008, the Attorney General made such a submission in the consolidated proceedings. Based on this submission, the court ordered dismissal of the complaints on June 3, 2009. Plaintiffs have appealed this dismissal, and the appeal remains pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Verizon Wireless has concluded an audit of its cell site, switch and non-retail building facilities under an audit agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The audit identified potential violations of various laws governing hazardous substance reporting, air permitting and spill plan preparation. A consent agreement relating to the audit was approved on November 24, 2009 by the EPA. While Verizon Wireless does not believe that any of the alleged violations has resulted in a release or threatened release, Verizon Wireless paid aggregate penalties of $468,600. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " Item 4.

On February 7, 2008, the Board approved a share buyback program which authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million common shares terminating no later than the close of business on February 28, 2011. The program permits Verizon to repurchase shares over time, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs. The Board also authorized Verizon to enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans from time to time to facilitate the repurchase of its shares. A Rule 10b5-1 plan permits the Company to repurchase shares at times when it might otherwise be prevented from doing so, provided the plan is adopted when the Company is not aware of material non-public information. During the fourth quarter of 2009, Verizon received 5 million common shares in partial settlement of the privately negotiated agreement previously entered into with a third party in connection with the share buyback program. At December 31, 2009, the maximum number of shares that may be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 60,015,938. ##TABLE_START ", "6": " Item 6.

Business  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START General  ##TABLE_END Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon, or the Company) is a holding company, which, acting through its subsidiaries is one of the worlds leading providers of communications services. Formerly known as Bell Atlantic Corporation, we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We began doing business as Verizon on June 30, 2000 following our merger with GTE Corporation. We have a highly diverse workforce of approximately 194,400 employees. Our principal executive offices are located at 140 West Street, New York, New York 10007 (telephone number 212-395-1000). We have two primary reportable segments, Domestic Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business segments and organize by products and services. These segments and principal activities consist of the following: ##TABLE_START Domestic Wireless  Domestic Wireless communications products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided to consumer, business and government customers across the United States. Wireline  Wirelines communications products and services include voice, Internet access, broadband video and data, Internet protocol (IP) network services, network access, long distance and other services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers in the United States and in over 150 other countries around the world. ##TABLE_END The following portions of the 2010 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners are incorporated into this report: ##TABLE_START    Overview on pages 14 through 16; and, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Segment Results of Operations on pages 22 through 27 and in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 69 through 71. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Domestic Wireless  ##TABLE_END Background Our Domestic Wireless segment, Cellco Partnership doing business as Verizon Wireless (Verizon Wireless), is a joint venture formed in April 2000 by the combination of the U.S. wireless operations and interests of Verizon and Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone). Verizon owns a controlling 55% interest in Verizon Wireless, and Vodafone owns the remaining 45%. Verizon Wireless provides wireless voice and data services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States and has the largest third generation (3G) network of any U.S. wireless service provider. Verizon Wireless is one of the largest wireless service providers in the United States as measured by total number of customers and revenue. In addition, we have begun the deployment in our network of a fourth-generation (4G) technology, Long Term Evolution (LTE), which provides higher data throughput performance and improved network efficiencies. As of December 31, 2010, this 4G LTE network was deployed in 38 major metropolitan areas and more than 60 commercial airports in the United States. We expect to deploy 4G LTE in an additional 140 markets by the end of 2011 and in virtually our entire current 3G network footprint by the end of 2013. In 2010, Domestic Wireless revenues were $63.4 billion, representing approximately 60% of Verizons aggregate revenues. Wireless Service and Product Offerings Our wireless services described below are available to our customers receiving service under the Verizon Wireless brand. In addition, certain of our customers receive services on our network as a result of wholesale arrangements that are also described below. Wireless Services Voice Services We offer voice services on a postpaid and prepaid basis. Approximately 88% of our retail customers received our voice services on a postpaid basis as of December 31, 2010. Postpaid customers typically enter into contracts for our services for a two-year period and are generally billed monthly in advance for access and in arrears for the preceding months usage over the customers plan allowance. Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless voice services without a long-term contract or credit verification by paying in advance.  We offer a variety of packages for voice services and features with competitive pricing, which we adjust from time to time to address changing customer preferences and needs and the availability of new technology, such as: ##TABLE_START    Nationwide Calling Plans for individual customers, which provide a choice, at varying price points, of differently sized bundles of minutes of use, or unlimited minutes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Nationwide Family SharePlans and Nationwide Small Business SharePlans designed for multiple-line accounts; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Nationwide Business Plans targeted to business accounts with over 100 lines. ##TABLE_END These nationwide postpaid plans include features, such as allowing the customer to place calls to, or receive calls from, any other Verizon Wireless customer mobile number without the call time counting against their minute allotment; night and weekend minute allowances; no domestic long distance charges; and no domestic roaming charges. Our customers can also make voice calls via our Push to Talk service, a walkie-talkie style voice service that is available on specialized phones as an add-on feature for an additional monthly charge. In addition, customers using certain smartphones and feature phones can make calls using Skype Mobile, an application that enables our customers to make and receive unlimited Skype calls and send and receive instant messages while within the United States to and from other Skype users anywhere in the world without these calls or messages counting against the customers minute allotment or incurring additional data charges. Data Services As wireless service providers continue to upgrade their networks to enhance data-carrying capabilities and to permit higher-speed data transmission, the demand for full Internet browsing capabilities for phones and the proliferation of wireless data applications for wireless-enabled laptops, phones and other wireless devices is increasing and driving wireless data usage. This growing demand for wireless data services has, in turn, spurred the demand for still-higher-speed network technologies and the development of an array of more advanced wireless devices that include more robust data functionality. Our 4G LTE network, which we began deploying in 2010, provides us with higher data throughput performance and improved network efficiencies compared to those offered by 3G technologies. During the first half of 2011, we expect to begin offering an array of 4G-enabled devices, including smartphones, tablets, a netbook, a notebook computer and Mobile Hotspot devices. We offer a wide variety of data services and applications, such as: ##TABLE_START    Internet access via our smartphones and feature phones. Our customers can access the Internet on all of our smartphones and many of our feature phones. All of our smartphones, and some of our feature phones, include HTML web browsing capability. Our customers pay for data access under plans and arrangements that may vary based on the type of device and the customers preference. For example, at this time, our retail postpaid customers using our smartphones are required to purchase a data package providing for unlimited data usage, while those using our feature phones have the option of paying for data usage on a pay-per-megabyte basis or purchasing a data package that includes either a limited data allowance or unlimited data usage. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our Mobile Broadband service, which enables our customers to access the Internet at broadband speeds.

(Google) Android operating system, and those offered via the Apple, Inc. (Apple) iTunes store, accessible through the iPhone 4, which we began selling in February 2011.  Other Connection-Related Services We provide data access and related services to support telemetry services, which are characterized by machine-to-machine (M2M) wireless interactions that do not include a voice component. Our telemetry services support M2M devices used by a variety of vertical market segments, such as healthcare, manufacturing, utilities, distribution and consumer products. For example, companies purchase data access from us in order to connect with and monitor equipment, such as medical devices used to monitor patients, and fleet management devices that monitor company-operated vehicles. Other companies purchase data access from us to support devices that they in turn sell to end users. In addition, we provide data access and related services to support telematics services, which generally involve the integration of wireless safety and security services into vehicles. We support telematics services for some of the largest automotive manufacturers, and we are currently the national provider of wireless service for OnStar, a subsidiary of General Motors Company. We do not include telemetry and telematics in our customer count. International Voice and Data Services We offer a variety of international wireless services targeted to the needs of our customers, ranging from our multinational business accounts to our consumer customers who occasionally travel outside of the United States. Through our roaming arrangements with certain wireless service providers outside of the United States, eligible customers can use any of our phones in more than 35 countries that provide CDMA wireless service, with data services available in more than 20 such countries. Our customers that use our Global Ready Phones can access voice service and, with the use of select Global Ready Phones, their e-mail accounts in hundreds of international destinations. In addition, our Global Data service enables our customers, while in such destinations, to access the Internet with a laptop or netbook that either has an embedded mobile broadband module or that is used in conjunction with other Global Ready devices that enable Internet access, such as our USB data modems, our global-ready Mobile Hotspot device or our Global Ready Phones when used with connector cables. Wireless Devices We believe that our position in the U.S. wireless industry has enabled us to become a wireless service provider of choice for wireless device manufacturers and has helped position us as the launch partner for new and innovative device offers for our customers and branded phones that complement our focus on high-quality service and an optimal user experience. We offer several categories of wireless devices, including smartphones and feature phones, as well as Internet access devices, such as computers, tablets, Mobile Hotspot devices and USB modems. The majority of the phones we offer are EV-DO enabled, and all of these phones are compliant with the FCCs Enhanced 911 requirements. We also offer a number of devices that, in addition to working on our EV-DO network, enable our customers to access GSM (global system for mobile communications) networks when traveling abroad. Smartphones . Our device line-up includes an array of smartphones that are enabled to utilize our EV-DO (Revision A) high-speed data service and have high-level operating platforms, such as Android, iOS 4, BlackBerry OS, webOS and Windows Mobile. We offer smartphones from Motorola, Apple, RIM, HTC, LG, Palm and Samsung. In addition, during the first half of 2011 we expect to offer smartphones that can operate on our 4G LTE network. Feature Phones . Some of our feature phones are EV-DO-enabled and have HTML-browsing capability. Many of our feature phones can access services such as V CAST and VZ Navigator, as well as Mobile Web, which enables our customers to access the Internet on their phones through our customized web portal. Certain of these phones have other enhanced features, such as QWERTY keyboards and touch screens. Additionally, we offer a selection of feature phones that operate via our CDMA-1XRTT service. Some of our feature phones are ruggedized and support our Push to Talk service. Internet Access Devices . Our customers can access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on their computers via data cards we offer, via EV-DO-enabled phones connected to their computers with connector cables, or through the use of certain laptop computers and netbooks with embedded EV-DO Mobile Broadband modules offered by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). In addition, we offer devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection, which we refer to as Mobile Hotspot devices, capable of connecting up to five Wi-Fienabled devices to the Internet at one time. We also offer a 3G-enabled, Android-based tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Tab, which runs on our 3G network, and the Apple iPad, which also runs on our 3G network when used in conjunction with our Mobile Hotspot devices. In connection with the launch of our 4G LTE network, we introduced USB modems for use with personal computers that enable our customers to access the Internet through our 4G LTE network. In addition, we announced that during the first half of 2011, we expect to be offering an array of devices that will enable our customers to access the Internet via our 4G LTE network, including smartphones, tablets, a netbook, a notebook computer and Mobile Hotspot devices. Device Suppliers We purchase wireless devices and accessories from a number of manufacturers, with the substantial majority of our purchases made from LG Electronics, Apple, Samsung, Motorola, RIM, Palm and PCD (through which we purchase Pantech and HTC devices and accessories). A key component of all wireless phones is the chipset, which contains the intelligence of the phone. Most of our smartphone and feature phone suppliers rely on Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm) for manufacturing and supplying CDMA-1XRTT and EV-DO chipsets. We also sell phones that include CDMA-1XRTT chipsets manufactured by VIA Telecom under license from Qualcomm. The LTE chipsets used in our LTE-enabled devices are manufactured by various companies, each using its own LTE chipset  technology. In addition, there are a number of other components common to wireless phones provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly. Application and Device Development We have undertaken several initiatives to develop innovative devices, data services and applications available to run on our 3G and/or 4G LTE networks, including the following: ##TABLE_START    Open Access. As part of our initiative intended to provide customers with the ability to use, on our network, third-party devices and mobile applications that we do not sell, we published the technical interface standards used by the development community to design such devices. Independent testing laboratories perform tests on third-party devices to ensure that they conform to these standards, and numerous devices have already been certified to run on our 3G network. While we initially commenced this initiative on a voluntary basis, we are also obligated to abide by certain open access rules imposed by the FCC with respect to the 700 MHz C block spectrum licenses we hold and are using in connection with the deployment of our 4G LTE network. These open access rules require, among other things, that we allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice on this spectrum, as long as such devices and applications meet certain network standards and have been approved by us. Consistent with these rules, further described in Regulatory and Competitive TrendsFCC RegulationWireless Services, we have published standards for our 4G LTE network that developers will use to design devices that can run on this network, and we have established a certification process for such devices. We have also published guidelines for developers seeking to design applications that will run on our 4G LTE network. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Business Solutions . Our business solutions organization is focused on delivering wireless solutions that address the needs of our business customers within the healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, utilities, finance, retail and government sectors. This organization has created the Business Solution Alliance, a joint marketing program with key device and application developers that brings industry-specific solutions to our business customers. We have also launched an external Business Solution Finder website, where businesses can learn more about the various solutions that have been developed by these device and application developers. In addition, we have dedicated resources to help design custom solutions aimed at improving the efficiency and productivity of our business customers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    nPhase. nPhase, our joint venture with Qualcomm, is facilitating our provision of M2M wireless communications solutions to a variety of vertical market segments, including healthcare, manufacturing, utilities, telematics, distribution and consumer products. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    LTE Innovation Center . We operate the Verizon Wireless LTE Innovation Center, which we believe will serve as a catalyst for the early development of devices and applications for use on LTE networks. The center works with several of our strategic partners to help the consumer electronics industry quickly bring products to market. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    ISIS . In 2010, we formed ISIS, a joint venture with ATT and T-Mobile, to create a mobile payment network that will enable customers to pay for point-of-sale purchases via their mobile phones via near field communications technology, rather than by using cash or a credit card. ##TABLE_END Networ k Our network is among the largest in the United States, with licensed and operational coverage in all of the top 100 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas. Our network covers a population of approximately 292 million and provides service to our customer base of approximately 94.1 million as of December 31, 2010. Our goal is to provide the highest network reliability. We focus our efforts on designing and deploying our network in a manner that we believe maximizes the number of calls by our customers that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped. Third-party studies conducted in the fourth quarter of 2010 show that, on a percentage basis, we have the fewest dropped calls and the fewest ineffective attempts among the national wireless service providers in the 98 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas. We plan to continue to build out, expand and upgrade our network and explore strategic opportunities to expand our national network coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses. Technology Our primary network technology platform is CDMA, based on spread-spectrum digital radio technology. CDMA-1XRTT technology is deployed in virtually all of the cell sites in our CDMA network. In addition, EV-DO, a 3G packet-based technology intended primarily for high-speed data transmission, is deployed in substantially all of the cell sites in our CDMA network. We also provide GSM service and fulfill GSM roaming obligations in certain markets as a result of our purchase of Rural Cellular and Alltel, as well as certain markets from ATT that it had previously acquired from Centennial Communications. Competing wireless service providers have chosen GSM/HSPA (high speed packet data) or other technologies as the technology platforms for their 3G networks. While we believe our 3G CDMA technology offers many advantages compared to GSM/HSPA, such as more efficient spectrum usage and lower overall operating costs, GSM/HSPA substantially leads in worldwide market share, affording its users certain scale advantages.  In 2010, we launched our 4G LTE network in 38 major metropolitan areas and more than 60 commercial airports in the United States, and we expect to deploy LTE in an additional 140 markets by the end of 2011 and in virtually our entire current 3G network footprint by the end of 2013. This new technology follows GSMs evolutionary path but is different from, and is an improvement upon, the previous generations of both GSM/HSPA- and CDMA-based digital radio technologies. LTE networks are designed to provide higher throughput performance and improved efficiencies for 4G LTE wireless voice and data services. Many other major wireless service providers, both domestic and foreign, have also selected LTE as the technology for their 4G LTE deployments. We believe that LTE will provide us with a 4G technology with global scale. Our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service. Power and backhaul transport facilities can often become a networks vulnerability. Consequently, we have battery backup at every switch and virtually every cell site in our network. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our cell sites and at every switch location. We further enhance reliability by providing secondary transport facilities for critical links in the network. Spectrum and Network Coverage The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services, including text and multi-media messaging, location based services, machine-to-machine services and broadband Internet access. We have licenses to provide wireless services on portions of the 800 MHz band (also known as cellular spectrum) and/or 1800-1900 MHz band (also known as PCS spectrum) in areas where virtually all of the population of United States reside. In parts of the United States, we also have licenses for advanced wireless services (AWS) spectrum in segments of the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands. In addition, we hold licenses for portions of the 700 MHz band, including eight licenses that can be used to provide wireless service coverage to the entire United States. We plan on using both our 700 MHz and AWS spectrum to provide advance broadband services, and in December 2010 we began using certain of our 700 MHz licenses for that purpose in connection with the launch of our 4G LTE network. In addition to our licensed coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in virtually all other areas in the United States where wireless service is available. Certain of our roaming agreements are terminable at will by either party upon several months notice; however, we do not believe that the termination of any of these at-will agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business. We anticipate that we will need additional spectrum in a limited number of our markets to meet future demand. We can meet spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when offered by the FCC in future spectrum auctions. Although the availability of new spectrum for commercial wireless services and the possible dates of future FCC spectrum auctions are unknown at this time, the FCC and the Obama Administration have been seeking the release of an additional 300 MHz of mobile use spectrum by 2015 and a further 200 MHz by 2020. As we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and have spectrum surpluses in others, we have at times arranged spectrum swaps, and we expect to have opportunities to use the beneficial trading of spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future, subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses in each instance. Network Equipment and Build-out Our primary cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are Alcatel-Lucent, which provides more than half of our cell site equipment, and Motorola and Ericsson, which together provide nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment. We also rely upon Alcatel-Lucent, Motorola and Ericsson for our switching equipment. Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our LTE network deployments. As we continue to build and upgrade our existing network, we must complete a variety of steps, including securing rights to a large number of cell site and switch site locations and obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals. In some instances, we have encountered difficulty in obtaining the necessary site leases at commercially reasonable rates and the zoning approvals needed to construct new towers. We utilize tower site management firms, such as Crown Castle International Corp. and American Tower Corporation, as lessors or managers of our existing tower sites upon which our operations depend. Marketing We focus our marketing strategy on offering solutions that are targeted to satisfy the needs of our various customer market segments, such as young adults, seniors, families, small to large businesses, global enterprises and the federal government; promoting our brand; leveraging our extensive distribution network; and cross-marketing with Verizons other business units and Vodafone. Our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television, print, radio, outdoor signage, Internet and point-of-sale media promotions designed to consistently present our marketing message across all of our markets. Our promotion of the Verizon Wireless brand is complemented by our marketing of the Verizon brand, reinforcing the awareness of our services in shared markets and capitalizing on the size and breadth of our Global Enterprise and Consumer Wireline base.  Sales and Distribution Channels Our sales strategy is to use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs. We rely on third-party providers for device warehousing and distribution. Direct Company-Operated Stores . Company-operated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy. We operate stores and kiosks throughout the United States, including store-within-a-store kiosks in many BJs Wholesale and PC Richard and Son locations. Business-to-Business . Our direct channel also includes our business-to-business operations and systems organization, which is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of our local, regional and national business customers. Enterprise and Government . We have a dedicated organization to more effectively serve the needs of our largest corporate customers and our federal and other large government accounts. This organization is focused on delivering to these customers integrated, industry-specific solutions to meet their telecommunications needs. Telemarketing and Web-Based . We have a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers, and we offer fully-automated, end-to-end web-based sales of wireless phones, accessories and service plans. Indirect Our agents sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the United States, as well as through the Internet. Local Agents . We have local agents strategically placed within our markets, in many cases in communities that are not in close proximity to one of our company-operated store locations. The majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services, and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us. National Retailers. High-profile, national retailers, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target, sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services. Our customers can also purchase the iPhone 4 at Apple stores throughout the United States. In addition, stores, such as Dollar General, Big Lots and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services. These and other national retailers constitute a significant portion of our indirect sales channel. Our ability to attract new subscribers and our revenue could be adversely affected if our relationship with any of our national indirect distributors were terminated or if they shifted the mix of their business to favor other wireless service providers. OEMs . Our distribution network has been further expanded by forming relationships with OEMs in the computer industry. For example, OEMs such as Dell, Lenovo, Hewlett Packard, Panasonic, OQO and Samsung are embedding EV-DO Mobile Broadband modules into certain of their notebook computer models and tablets, enabling users to activate data service on our network and connect at broadband speeds to corporate networks, e-mail and the Internet. Bulk Sale of Wireless Access We sell wireless capacity on a bulk basis. Our traditional wholesale business involves the sale of voice and/or data access to independent companies, such as Tracfone, that in turn resell wireless services to their end users. We had approximately 6.6 million of these wholesale lines as of December 31, 2010. We also sell wireless capacity to support telemetry and telematics services, as described above. Customer Service, Retention and Satisfaction We believe that quality customer service is a key differentiator in the wireless industry because it increases customer satisfaction, which reduces the rate at which our customers disconnect individual lines of service (churn). Therefore, satisfying and retaining existing customers is critical to the financial performance of wireless service providers and an essential element of our strategy. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. We have customer service representatives available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to assist with technical customer issues, as well as dedicated customer service teams to address the specialized needs of our business customers. Customers can also conduct business with us at any time without having to speak with a customer service representative through our enhanced self-serve applications, which allow them to access their account information, make payments and make changes to their accounts. These applications include our interactive voice response system, our web site and applications accessible from a customers phone. We have undertaken a variety of customer retention initiatives, including providing customers with the option to change their service plan at any time to any qualifying wireless service plan without paying any additional fees or requiring any contract extension; instituting an early termination fee that decreases after each full month that a customer remains on their contract; and providing customers with the ability to upgrade their phone prior to the end of their contract term at promotional pricing, provided that the customer signs a new qualifying service contract. We also contact customers at key times during the customer relationship about targeted offers and to provide proactive service plan analysis.  Competition We compete primarily against three other national wireless service providers: ATT, Sprint Nextel Corporation and T-Mobile USA. In addition, in many markets we also compete with regional wireless service providers, such as US Cellular, Metro PCS and Leap Wireless. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilities-based wireless service providers for resale, including those that buy from us. We expect competition to intensify as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels, the development and deployment of new technologies, the introduction of new products and services, new market entrants, the availability of additional spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, and regulatory changes. Competition may also increase if smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized and more experienced wireless service providers. The wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services. For example, Skype, as well as Google, Apple and others, are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless providers voice service. We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry: ##TABLE_START   Network reliability, capacity and coverage . We believe that a wireless network that consistently provides high quality and reliable service is a key differentiator in the U.S. market and a driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new data service offerings have led to increased customer usage of wireless services, which in turn puts pressure on network capacity. In order to compete effectively, wireless service providers must keep pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through their networks. We have begun the deployment of our 4G LTE network. Certain other wireless service providers have also deployed, or are planning to deploy, LTE or other 4G technologies, such as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Pricing . Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless data services continues to grow, wireless services providers are offering service plans that include bundled data packages in varying megabyte or gigabyte sizes or, in some cases, unlimited data usage. In addition, certain wireless service providers are also offering minutes-sharing plans; free mobile-to-mobile calling; offerings of larger bundles of included minutes at attractive price points, with no roaming or long distance charges; calling group features that enable customers to place and receive calls from a group of U.S. phone numbers they designate (including landline numbers) without the call time counting against their minute allotment; and both prepaid and postpaid plans offering unlimited voice and data usage. We seek to compete in this area by offering our customers services and equipment that they will regard as the best available value for the price, as well as service plans that meet their needs for both voice and data services. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Customer service . We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting both new-to-wireless customers and customers of other wireless providers. We continually focus on enhancing our customer service. Our competitors also recognize the importance of customer service and are also focusing on improving it. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Product and service development . As wireless technologies develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate, continued customer and revenue growth will be increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced data products and services. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative wireless products and services both independently and in collaboration with application service providers. We also collaborate with various device manufacturers in the development of distinctive smartphones and other wireless devices that can access the growing array of data applications and content available over the Internet. We continue to focus on increasing smartphone penetration throughout our customer base. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Sales and distribution . Key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We believe that attaining the optimal combination of varying distribution channels is important to achieving industry-leading profitability, as measured by operating income. We endeavor to increase sales through our company-operated stores, outside sales teams and telemarketing and web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, as well as through our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations and netbook and notebook OEMs. In addition, we sell wireless access to both traditional resellers, which resell wireless services to their end-users, and to various companies to enable wireless communications for their M2M devices or for their provision of telematics services. See MarketingSales and Distribution Channels. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Capital resources . In order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services, wireless service providers require significant capital resources. We generate significant cash flow from operations, as do some of our competitors. ##TABLE_END Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry, including the factors described above, as well as new technologies, new business models, changes in customer preferences, regulatory changes, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors.  ##TABLE_START Wireline ##TABLE_END Background The Wireline segment provides customers with communications products and services that include voice, Internet access, broadband video and data, IP network services, network access, long distance and other services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the United States, as well as to businesses, government customers and carriers both in the United States and in over 150 other countries around the world. In 2010, Wireline revenues were $41.2 billion, representing approximately 39% of Verizons aggregate revenues. Wireline Service and Product Offerings We organize our service and product offerings by the primary market targeted by these offerings  mass markets, global enterprise, global wholesale and other. In July 2010, the Company spun off a subsidiary of Verizon (Spinco) to its stockholders which held defined assets and liabilities of the local exchange business and related landline activities of the Company in predominantly rural areas in 14 states. Immediately following the spin-off, Spinco merged with Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) pursuant to a definitive agreement with Frontier. This transaction further focused the Companys Mass Markets asset base around its fastest growing business  FiOS fiber-optic services. Mass Markets Mass Markets operations provide local exchange (basic service and end-user access), long distance (including regional toll), broadband services (including high-speed Internet and FiOS Internet) and FiOS TV services to residential and small business subscribers. In partnership with DIRECTV, Verizon also offers satellite television service to enable double- and triple-play offers in non-FiOS markets. In 2010, Mass Markets revenue were $16.3 billion, representing approximately 40% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. Our goal is to be the customers first choice for communications and entertainment services. To achieve this, we offer a variety of services at different price points. Video Services. We offer Verizons fiber-optic TV and video service as well as market a variety of DIRECTV packages that are delivered over satellite systems. As of December 31, 2010, FiOS TV is available to approximately 12.4 million homes across 11 states: New York, New Jersey, California, Delaware, Texas, Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Virginia and Rhode Island, as well as the District of Columbia. We believe FiOS TV has features that differentiate it from the competition, including its channel line-up, breadth of high definition content and video on demand, as well as the following: ##TABLE_START    Interactive Media Guide  Our FiOS TV guide helps customers quickly and easily find content from television listings, video on demand catalogs and their own personal music and photo files. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Home Media DVR  Our multi-room digital video recorder, which allows recording in one room and viewing in another, also includes the Interactive Media Guide. The device also provides customers with the flexibility of moving content seamlessly from the PC/laptop to the wide screen for a richer viewing experience of user-generated content such as videos and photos. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    FiOS TV Widgets  Viewers have one-touch, on demand access to local weather, traffic and community information and increasingly popular social media applications such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as online commerce opportunities. The widget platform has evolved to an open-development environment, which provides opportunities for third parties to develop enhanced customer features via the FiOS TV product. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    FlexView  With FlexView, FiOS customers can view nearly 2,000 titles outside the home from a computer, tablet, netbook or compatible mobile phone. We expect that FlexView will also include TV shows in the near future. ##TABLE_END Data Services. We offer high speed Internet and FiOS broadband data products with varying downstream and upstream processing speeds. In 2010, we continued to see increased demand for upstream bandwidth to support video and photo sharing in a secure environment. We also enhanced our FiOS offerings with faster speeds. Residential customers can now order FiOS Internet with speeds of up to 150 Mbps downstream and 35 Mbps upstream, which is currently the fastest mass-market broadband service in the United States. Voice Services. We offer packages that include local exchange, regional, long distance, wire maintenance and voice messaging services, as well as VoIP services, which use the Internet or private broadband networks to transmit voice communications. We also offer calling plans to bundle landline and wireless services with calling features and unlimited calling between a Verizon customers home phone and wireless handset, all on a single bill.  Global Enterprise Global Enterprise offers voice, data and Internet communications services to medium and large business customers, multinational corporations and state and federal government customers. Our focus areas of growth in this segment include IP services and value-added solutions that make communications more secure, reliable and efficient. In 2010, Global Enterprise revenues were $15.7 billion, representing approximately 38% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of economic and technological trends in this area. With a strong global IP network and robust service portfolio, we are able to assist customers with their transition to next generation services. Our portfolio of services consists of traditional core voice and data services and strategic services comprised of managed and advanced products and solutions. On January 27, 2011, Verizon announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the common stock of Terremark Worldwide, Inc., a global provider of IT infrastructure and cloud services, for $19 per share in cash (or approximately $1.4 billion). Terremark had approximately $0.5 billion of debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010. The acquisition, which is subject to the satisfaction of conditions, including the receipt of a regulatory approval, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2011. The acquisition will enhance Verizons offerings to governmental and large enterprise customers. Core Services . Core voice services consist of a comprehensive portfolio of global voice solutions utilizing traditional voice and newer VoIP technologies. Core data services include frame relay, ATM and private line access technologies. Core services also include providing customer premises equipment, installation, maintenance and site services. Strategic Services. We have professional services personnel in more than 30 countries to assist customers in adopting new IT solutions, such as application management, infrastructure services, unified communications, contact center solutions and security and business continuity services, as we seek to assist customers in transforming the way they operate. We have introduced new offerings for multinational corporate and government customers including IT consulting and managed services to help enterprises transition to cloud computing technologies; telehealth collaboration services; consulting services designed to help track and protect corporate data; a cloud-based application performance monitoring service; and solutions to prevent hacker threats to corporate applications. Our Strategic Services include: ##TABLE_START    Private IP  Our fastest growing service around the world, our multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) based solution enables customers to securely leverage the efficiency, performance and value of IP by increasing the speed of network traffic as it travels over various platforms including IP, ATM and Frame Relay. Due to a new network alliance with Gateway Business Africa, we are expanding our Private IP network capabilities in several African countries. The alliance also allows us to extend the coverage of the Verizon MPLS network to an additional 14 African countries by using interconnection points between the countries networks. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Managed Services  Offers companies the opportunity to outsource the management of their networks, security, remote access, and web applications. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Enterprise Mobility  Enables customers to remotely access our global IP network and leverage wireless applications. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Applications Hosting  Offers hosting and managing of corporate software applications and provides content delivery for customers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Customer Service Management  Provides tools that improve the customers experience and increase call center efficiency and productivity. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Security  Provides integrated solutions to help companies secure their networks and data. Over the past two years, we have expanded our managed security services portfolio, based on risk issues identified by our investigative response and forensics team. We have also invested in data breach research, culminating in the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, the Verizon Payment Card Industry Compliance Report and the ICSA Labs Product Assurance Report, and established a state-of-the art hygienic lab that prevents external contaminants, such as dust, from spoiling sensitive evidence. ##TABLE_END In 2010, we began a multi-year reorganization of our Global Enterprise operating model to allow us to continue to be competitive in the information and communication technology market. The goal of this project is to improve the customer experience, our geographic balance, and the global consistency of our operations and to transform our business models and our talent in order to further grow our revenues and our business.  Global Wholesale Global Wholesale offers switched access and special access services primarily to long distance and other carriers who use our facilities to provide services to their customers. A portion of Global Wholesale revenues is generated by a few large telecommunication companies, many of whom compete directly with us. In 2010, Global Wholesale revenues were $8.4 billion, representing approximately 20% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of voice, data, value-added business and local telecommunications services to a wide array of customers, including interexchange carriers, resellers, cable service operators, Internet service providers, network and systems integrators and content data network providers. These include: ##TABLE_START    Voice Services. We offer regional access, VoIP services and long distance services both domestically and internationally. We are a leading provider of international voice services, serving customers on six continents and in over 150 countries. In addition, we offer interconnection services for local and wireless service providers who need to terminate traffic in our networks to reach their end users and subscribers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Data Services. We offer a robust portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance wholesale customer networks and to provide connections to their end users and subscribers. Our data services include: private line special access, fast packet, optical, Ethernet and IP services, each available in multiple options and configurations to support the complex needs of our customers. Our wireless customers in the United States represent the largest growth opportunity in wholesale, as they are significantly building up backhaul connections from their cell sites back to mobile switching centers. At the same time, they are migrating networks from time division multiplexing (TDM) to Ethernet, which will better scale and service the growth of broadband services driven by smartphones, mobile broadband and mobile video. Global Wholesale offers a complete suite of services to support the expansion of 3G networks and the roll-out of 4G LTE. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Value Added Business Services. Global Wholesale offers value-added business services, leveraging many of the same offerings available in the Global Enterprise portfolio, including: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Managed Services  Offers wholesale customers the opportunity to outsource the management of their networks, security, remote access, and web applications to Verizon. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Mobility  Enables wholesale customers to complement their portfolio to triple-play or quad-play capability by leveraging wireless devices and services offered through Verizon Wireless and packaged and resold under their own carrier brand. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Security  Provides wholesale customers integrated solutions to help their enterprise end users secure their networks and data. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Local Services. We offer an array of local dial tone and broadband services to competitive local exchange carriers, some of which are offered to comply with telecommunications regulations. In addition, we offer services such as collocation, resale and unbundled network elements in compliance with mandated regulation. ##TABLE_END Other Other services include such services as local exchange and long distance services derived from former MCI mass market customers, operator services, pay phone, card services and supply sales, as well as dial around services including 10-10-987, 10-10-220, 1-800-COLLECT and prepaid cards. In 2010, Other revenues were $0.9 billion, representing approximately 2% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. Network In order to provide services to our Mass Markets, Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale customers, we operate advanced telecommunications networks in the United States and around the world. Our goal is to be the premier broadband and entertainment service provider in the mass market. Network reliability and functionality are key to achieving that goal. Our deployment of Fiber-to-the-Premise (FTTP) access technologies over fiber optic cables provides the highest possible bandwidth to the customer premise based on current technology and allows us the flexibility to adapt our facilities more easily to future product development. For example, new optical terminals can be added to the FTTP network providing greater bandwidth and new services without any additional field construction. Verizons recent launch of 150/35 Mbps Internet service delivers the fastest mass-market broadband service in the United States over our FiOS network. Our new Internet service offers three times the downstream speed previously available to FiOS customers. Recent field trials successfully achieved connection speeds of nearly 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) downstream and upstream, and when a more advanced XG-PON2 technology was connected to the network, connection speeds of 10 Gbps were reached on the fiber-optic network, demonstrating the significant headroom built into the FiOS network.  The FTTP network is also supporting the introduction of FlexView, giving FiOS TV customers the ability to take video programming outside of the home and view it on a computer, tablet, netbook or compatible mobile phone. FiOS also supports 3-D programming, including several feature films and the first televised National Football League and Major League Baseball games in 3-D. Other emerging applications that will be supported by our expanded network capacity include high definition video sharing, video telephony, telemedicine and offsite backups and storage services. In conjunction with the evolution of our access plant, we are also transitioning our metro (local) network infrastructure from traditional TDM/SONET (Synchronous Optical Network)/ATM technologies to Ethernet over Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM). This new optical transport network provides features optimized for video distribution services and high speed data services, while maintaining the level of network reliability achieved with SONET. To leverage this new network infrastructure and allow for the more efficient sharing of our network across services, we are upgrading our multiplexing and routing infrastructure to use IP, Ethernet and MPLS technologies. In addition, we are migrating from traditional TDM-based voice switching to VoIP. This migration lowers the cost of current data and voice services and creates a network that can offer future multi-media communications services by adding service platforms without requiring widespread network upgrades. We have been focused on growing our Ethernet infrastructure to support the full range of Ethernet private line and E-LAN services locally, domestically and globally. To lower the access cost and provide significant service flexibility, we are using a converged packet access strategy that replaces the private circuit-based customer access and aggregates traffic from multiple customers onto a shared Ethernet and MPLS network. We also continue to focus on emerging optical transport technologies to lower overall cost as we integrate Ethernet, SONET and Optics, and ultra-long-haul technologies. We have expanded our Virtual Private LAN service to Europe, Asia-Pacific, and additional North American locations. We have focused on the expansion of our private IP network to serve all key international markets with managed Quality of Service-aware IP Virtual Private Network services. Our Public IP network is now interconnected to our private IP network through Security Gateway platforms that allow business customers to extend the reach of their private virtual networks to off-net sites, such as employees homes, small branch offices and mobile work forces. We have installed additional private IP edge routers for a total of 814 edge routers in 233 sites throughout 61 countries; and added nineteen new converged packet architecture switches, for a total of 153 CPA switches in 132 sites across 36 countries. We deployed the industrys first commercial 100G (gigabits per second) ultra-long-haul optical system for live traffic on our European optical core network, and successfully completed other field trials of 100G technology in North America and Great Britain in preparation for further ultra-long-haul deployments. We expect to activate the Europe India Gateway system in early 2011, linking countries/territories between Europe, the Middle East and India, delivering significant network capacity and diversity into emerging international markets. In addition, we added a Japan landing to the Trans-Pacific Express (TPE) submarine cable system connecting the west coast of the United States to China, Korea and Taiwan. Our Fiber-to-the-Cellsite (FTTCS) backhaul initiative is critical to supporting the substantial growth requirements of expanding 3G and 4G LTE wireless data networks nationwide. To support this initiative, over 8,900 cell site connections were completed in 2010, totaling almost four times the sites completed in 2009. Customer Service We are committed to providing superior customer service as a key factor in achieving customer satisfaction and retention. As part of that endeavor, we focus on allowing our customers to conduct business with us in the way that is most convenient for them. Increasingly, our customers are choosing to do business with us online, including diagnosing and fixing problems and ordering our products and services. In light of this, in 2010, we completed a redesign of our website to make it easier for customers to use. We also deployed In-Home Agent to our broadband and FiOS TV customers. This tool allows our individual and small business customers to self-diagnose and correct issues they may encounter without having to make a call to us or schedule a technician visit. In addition we enhanced the online experience for our business customers by providing content targeted directly to our major segments to address their particular needs, as well as information about all of our core and strategic solutions. We provide live 24/7 customer support on all FiOS sales and service issues. We have also undertaken several customer service initiatives, including our FiOS Worry Free Guarantee for consumers and small businesses and our Service Level Agreements for Enterprise and Global Wholesale, which guarantee our service.  Competition The wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify further with traditional, non-traditional and emerging players seeking increased market share. Current and potential competitors include cable companies, wireless service providers, other domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, Internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. In the Mass Markets business, cable operators are significant competitors. Cable operators have increased the size and digital capacity of their networks so that they can offer digital products and services. We continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include high-speed Internet access, digital television and voice services. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. In addition, wireless substitution is an ongoing competitive trend, which we expect to continue as wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from companies that provide VoIP services. VoIP services are available from a wide range of companies including cable companies, and national and regional providers. Internet portal providers are also entering our competitive space. As a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which requires us to allow potential competitors to purchase our services for resale, or access components of our network on an unbundled basis at a prescribed cost, competition in our local exchange markets continues. Our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to competitive local exchange carriers at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers. The scope of these obligations going forward and the rates we receive, are subject to ongoing review and revision by the FCC and state regulators. See Regulatory and Competitive Trends in the 2010 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners. In the Global Enterprise business, the customers need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is driving the expansion of the competitive landscape. Major competitors include system integrators, carriers, hardware and software providers. Some of the biggest companies in IT services are either making acquisitions or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending. Most new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing, software delivery, communication applications and other computing tasks via the network, rather than on in-house machines. Carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major IT outsourcers. Global Wholesale competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. Additionally, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity. In addition, companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and, to a lesser extent, global wholesale markets. We compete with these full, or near-full service providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have a strong market presence, brand recognition, and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition and which may affect our future revenue growth. We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry: ##TABLE_START   Customer Service : Customers expect industry leading service from their service providers in the Mass Markets, Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale businesses. As technologies and services evolve, the ability of a carrier to excel in this area is very important for customer acquisition and retention. In Mass Markets, we compete in this area through our service representatives and online support, recently recognized as industry leading by an independent survey organization. In Global Enterprise, we provide our customers with ready access to their system and performance information and conduct proactive testing of the network to identify minor issues before they affect customers. In the Wholesale business, service improvement can be achieved through continued system automation initiatives. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Network reliability and bandwidth (speed): As both consumers and small business customers look to leverage high speed connections for entertainment, communications, and productivity, we expect broadband penetration will continue to increase over the next several years. As online and online-enabled activities increase, so will bandwidth requirements, both downstream and upstream. To succeed, we and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can deliver against these increasing bandwidth requirements. We are continuing to build out our network to be able to meet this future demand. In addition, network reliability and security are increasingly important competitive factors in the Global Enterprise business. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Pricing : Cable, telecommunications companies and integrated service providers use pricing to capture market share from incumbents. Pricing is also significant as non-traditional modes of providing communication services emerge and new entrants compete for customers. For example, portal-based and VoIP calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Product differentiation : As a result of pricing pressures, providers need to differentiate their products. Customers are shifting from an access to an applications mindset and are focused on how they can leverage their broadband and video connections. Converged features, such as integrated wireless and wireline functionality, are becoming similarly important, enabled by both customer demand and technological advancement. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START Patents, Trademarks and Licenses ##TABLE_END Verizon owns or has licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad, and have significantly increased the rate of such filings each year. Verizon also actively grants licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable such companies to utilize certain Verizon intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable such third party licensees to take advantage of the results of Verizons research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to Verizon, we do not believe that loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations. Verizon periodically receives offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, or cease offering the relevant products or services. ##TABLE_START Acquisitions and Divestitures ##TABLE_END Acquisitions and Divestitures included in Other Factors That May Affect Future Results on page 36 of the 2010 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners is incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_START Regulatory and Competitive Trends ##TABLE_END Regulatory and Competitive Trends included in Other Factors That May Affect Future Results on pages 37 through 39 of the 2010 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners is incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_START Environmental Matters ##TABLE_END Environmental Matters included in Other Factors That May Affect Future Results on page 39 of the 2010 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners is incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_START Executive Officers ##TABLE_END See Part III, Item 10.

Risk Factors ##TABLE_END The following discussion of Risk Factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations. Unfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or in one or more of our other major markets, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining products and services under lower-cost programs offered by other companies. Similarly, under these conditions the business customers that we serve in the United States and abroad may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We face significant competition that may reduce our market share and lower our profits. We face significant competition in our industry. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated the traditional distinctions between local, long distance, wireless, cable and Internet communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, application and device providers, electric utilities, and providers of VoIP services. While these changes have enabled us to offer new types of services, they have also allowed other service providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our services and equipment, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to successfully respond to these competitive challenges, we could lose market share and experience reduced profits. If we are not able to take advantage of technological developments in the telecommunications industry on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in the demand for our services or may be unable to implement our business strategy. Our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, to enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers changing demands. If we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. In general, the development of new services in our industry requires us to anticipate and respond to the varied and continually changing demands of our customers. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints to our introduction of new services. If these services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. For example, we have selected Long Term Evolution technology (LTE) as our next-generation wireless network access technology. We expect this new technology to enable us to offer a mobile data network with higher speeds and improved efficiencies. Other wireless service providers have announced their plans to adopt LTE as their next-generation technology, and we believe that it will become the principal next-generation global standard. There are risks, however, that these other wireless service providers may delay their deployment of LTE or change their selection and adopt different next-generation technologies, including technologies that are incompatible with ours. As a result, LTE may not become the principal next-generation global standard and may not provide us with the global scale, compatibility and other benefits that we expect in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our ability to deploy LTE on our network successfully and in a timely manner depends on various factors that are beyond our control, including the risk that our suppliers may be unable to manufacture and deliver LTE devices and network equipment on schedule and according to our specifications. Furthermore, our deployment of LTE may not occur at the cost we have estimated. If these risks materialize, our ability to provide next generation wireless services to our customers, to retain and attract customers, and to maintain and grow our customer revenues could be materially adversely affected.  We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as switch and network equipment, handsets and other devices and equipment, that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. For example, our handset and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices. If these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers. We also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. Because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry. We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology. Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict our ability to operate in or provide specified products or services in designated areas, require that we maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are frequently involved in regulatory and non-regulatory governmental proceedings related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Unless we are able to obtain appropriate relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful at obtaining the licenses we need to carry out our business strategy or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years that are subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our wireless business, results of operations and financial condition. The adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal or state level could also adversely affect our business plans. New regulations could restrict the ways in which we can manage our wireline and wireless networks, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. For example, the development of new technologies, such as IP-based services, including VoIP and super high-speed broadband and video, could be subject to conflicting regulation between the FCC and various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology. As the holder of 700 MHz C Block licenses, we are required to comply with certain open access regulations that the FCC has imposed on all licensees of 700 MHz C Block spectrum. These rules require us to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice on the LTE network we are deploying on that spectrum, including those obtained from sources other than us or our distributors or dealers, subject to certain technical limitations established by us. The FCC has not yet finally determined what level of access will satisfy the open access requirements. Once finally determined, these requirements may increase the costs or limit the revenue-generating potential associated with our use of the C block. In addition, on December 21, 2010, the FCC adopted an order in which it imposed so-called net neutrality rules that it describes as intended to preserve the openness of the Internet. These new rules limit the ways that a broadband Internet access service provider can manage its network and the services it can provide over the network. Given that the scope of the restrictions and many critical terms in this order are not fully defined and given that the order creates procedural mechanisms for parties to complain of violations of the order, it is reasonable to expect litigation to resolve ambiguities, which could lead to yet further regulation. The regulation of broadband activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our broadband networks. Natural disasters, terrorist attacks or breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business. Natural disasters, terrorist acts, acts of war, cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology (IT) security may cause equipment failures or disrupt our operations. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share to other communications providers. In addition, a failure to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against breaches of network or IT security could result in damage to our reputation. Any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could affect our access to financing. Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. With approximately 194,400 employees and approximately 215,400 retirees as of December 31, 2010 participating in Verizons benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors including the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the enactment of any similar health care reform measures at the state level, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts or additional organizing activity. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 30% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. Labor contracts covering many of our employees will expire in 2011. Accordingly, in 2011, we will be engaged in negotiations with our labor unions regarding new contracts. Depending on the outcome of these negotiations, we could incur additional costs and/or experience lengthy work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations, including a loss of revenue and strained relationships with customers, and we cannot predict the length of any such work stoppage. In addition, while the workforce of our wireless business is almost entirely non-union, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our costs. We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. Our business faces a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Land, buildings and building equipment consists of land and land improvements, central office buildings or any other buildings that house network equipment, and buildings that are used for administrative and other purposes. Substantially all the switching centers are located on land and in buildings we own due to their critical role in the network and high set-up relocation costs. We also maintain facilities throughout the United States comprised of administrative and sales offices, customer care centers, retail sales locations, switching centers, cell sites and data centers. Furniture and other consists of public telephones and telephone equipment, furniture, data processing equipment, office equipment, motor vehicles, plant under construction, capitalized non-network computer software costs and leasehold improvements. A portion of our property is subject to the liens of their respective mortgages securing funded debt. ##TABLE_START ", "3": " Item 3. Legal Proceedings ##TABLE_END Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon), and a number of other telecommunications companies, have been the subject of multiple class action suits concerning its alleged participation in intelligence-gathering activities allegedly carried out by the federal government, at the direction of the President of the United States, as part of the governments post-September 11 program to prevent terrorist attacks. Plaintiffs generally allege that Verizon has participated by permitting the government to gain access to the content of its subscribers telephone calls and/or records concerning those calls and that such action violates federal and/or state constitutional and statutory law. Relief sought in the cases includes injunctive relief, attorneys fees, and statutory and punitive damages. On August 9, 2006, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (Panel) ordered that these actions be transferred, consolidated and coordinated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The Panel subsequently ordered that a number of tag along actions also be transferred to the Northern District of California. Verizon believes that these lawsuits are without merit. On July 10, 2008, the President signed into law the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which provides for dismissal of these suits by the court based on submission by the Attorney General of the United States of a specified certification. On September 19, 2008, the Attorney General made such a submission in the consolidated proceedings. Based on this submission, the court ordered dismissal of the complaints on June 3, 2009. Plaintiffs have appealed this dismissal, and the appeal remains pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On September 15, 2010, the U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bank), as Litigation Trustee for the Idearc, Inc. Litigation Trust (Litigation Trust), filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against Verizon and certain subsidiaries challenging the November 2006 spin-off of Verizons former directories business then known as Idearc Inc. U.S. Bank, which represents a group of creditors who filed claims in the Idearc, Inc. bankruptcy proceedings, alleges that Idearc Inc. was insolvent at the time of the spin-off or became insolvent shortly thereafter. The Litigation Trust seeks over $9 billion in damages.  ##TABLE_START PART II ", "4": "", "5": " Item 5.

On February 3, 2011, the Board approved a share buyback program which authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of Verizon common stock terminating no later than the close of business on February 28, 2014. The Board also determined that no additional shares were to be purchased under the previously authorized buyback program. The program permits Verizon to repurchase shares over time, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs. The Board may also enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans from time to time to facilitate repurchases of its shares under this authorization. A Rule 10b5-1 plan permits the Company to repurchase shares at times when it might otherwise be prevented from doing so, provided the plan is adopted when the Company is not aware of material non-public information. During the fourth quarter of 2010, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon common stock. At December 31, 2010, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under the share buyback program in place at that time was 60,015,938.

Business  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START General  ##TABLE_END Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon, or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the worlds leading providers of communications, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies with a presence in over 150 countries around the world. Formerly known as Bell Atlantic Corporation, we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We began doing business as Verizon on June 30, 2000 following our merger with GTE Corporation. We have a highly diverse workforce of approximately 193,900 employees. Our principal executive offices are located at 140 West Street, New York, New York 10007 (telephone number 212-395-1000). We have two primary reportable segments, Verizon Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business segments and organize by products and services. ##TABLE_START Verizon Wireless  Verizon Wireless communications products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided to consumer, business and government customers across the United States. Wireline  Wirelines communications products and services include voice, Internet access, broadband video and data, Internet protocol network services, network access, long distance and other services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and in over 150 other countries around the world. ##TABLE_END The following portions of the 2011 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners are incorporated into this report: ##TABLE_START    Overview on pages 26 through 28; and, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Segment Results of Operations on pages 33 through 38 and in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 77 through 79. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Verizon Wireless  ##TABLE_END Background Our Verizon Wireless segment, primarily comprised of Cellco Partnership doing business as Verizon Wireless (Verizon Wireless), is a joint venture formed in April 2000 by the combination of the U.S. wireless operations and interests of Verizon and Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone). Verizon owns a controlling 55% interest in Verizon Wireless, and Vodafone owns the remaining 45%. Verizon Wireless provides wireless voice and data services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States and has the largest third-generation (3G) and fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution technology (LTE) networks of any U.S. wireless service provider. Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless service provider in the United States as measured by retail customers and revenue. At December 31, 2011, Verizon Wireless had 92.2 million retail customers and 2011 revenues of approximately $70.2 billion, representing approximately 63% of Verizons 2011 aggregate revenues. In 2010, we launched our 4G LTE mobile broadband network, which provides higher data throughput performance and improved network efficiencies. As of January 19, 2012, we have deployed 4G LTE in 195 markets covering more than 200 million people throughout the country. We expect to deploy 4G LTE in virtually all of our current 3G network footprint by mid-2013. Wireless Service and Product Offerings Our wireless services described below are available to our customers receiving service under the Verizon Wireless brand. In addition, certain of our customers receive services on our network on a wholesale basis.  Wireless Services We offer voice and data services on a postpaid and prepaid basis. Postpaid customers represent individual lines of service for which a customer is billed and pays in advance a monthly access charge in return for a monthly voice and/or data service allowance, and use of any services beyond the allowance is billed in arrears. Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless data and voice services without a long-term contract or credit verification by paying in advance. Approximately 95% of our retail customers received our data and voice services on a postpaid basis as of December 31, 2011. Data Services As wireless service providers continue to upgrade their networks to enhance data-carrying capabilities and to permit higher-speed data transmission, the demand for full Internet browsing capabilities for phones and the proliferation of wireless data applications for wireless-enabled laptops, phones and other wireless devices is increasing and driving wireless data usage. This growing demand for wireless data services has, in turn, spurred the demand for still-higher-speed network technologies and the development of an array of more advanced wireless devices that include more robust data functionality. Our 4G LTE network provides us with higher data throughput performance and improved network efficiencies compared to those offered by 3G technologies. During 2011, we began offering an array of 4G-enabled devices, including smartphones, tablets, netbooks, notebook computers and devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection that we refer to as Jetpack devices. We offer a wide variety of Verizon Wireless-branded data services and applications, such as: ##TABLE_START    Internet access via our smartphones and basic phones. Our customers can access the Internet on all of our smartphones, as well as our basic phones that include HTML web-browsing capability. Our customers pay for data access under plans and arrangements that may vary based on the type of device and the customers preference for data usage. We offer usage-based data packages and data plans that allow customers, regardless of the device, to select the plan that best matches their data usage patterns. This data pricing model offers customers more options for smartphones, basic phones, tablets and netbooks. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our Mobile Broadband service, which enables our customers to access the Internet at broadband speeds. Our customers can access our Mobile Broadband service on netbooks, notebook computers and tablets that either have embedded 4G LTE or Evolution  Data Optimized (EV-DO) Mobile Broadband modules, or that are used in conjunction with separate Mobile Broadband devices that enable access to this service, such as smartphones, as well as USB modems and other dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection. Our 4G LTE and 3G Mobile Broadband plans are offered at various price points, depending upon both the size of the gigabyte package purchased and the Mobile Broadband-enabled device covered by the plan. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Messaging services, which enable our customers to send and receive text, picture and video messages. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Consumer-focused multimedia offerings, which provide our customers with access to applications providing music, video, gaming, news and other content. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Business-focused offerings designed to increase the productivity of our business customers, including solutions for accessing the Internet and their corporate intranets and products that enable wireless e-mail across our diverse portfolio of wireless devices. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Location-based services, which, among other things, can provide our customers with directions to their destinations and enable our business customers to locate, monitor and communicate with their mobile field workers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Global Data services, which allow our customers to access their e-mail on our Global Ready Phones while at hundreds of international destinations and to access the Internet at such destinations with laptops that are either Global Ready, tethered to a Global Ready Phone, or are used in conjunction with other Global Ready devices, such as certain USB data modems or Jetpacks. ##TABLE_END In addition to the foregoing offerings, our customers, depending upon the wireless devices they use, have access to thousands of data applications and services developed and distributed by third parties, such as those offered via Android Market, accessible on our smartphones running on the Google, Inc. (Google) Android operating system, and those offered via the Apple, Inc. (Apple) iTunes store, accessible through smartphones and tablets running on the Apple iOS operating system. Voice Services We offer a variety of plans for voice services and features with competitive pricing tailored to meet the needs of customers seeking individual lines of service, as well as those family or business customers with multiple-line accounts. In addition, many of our plans allow customers to place calls to, and receive calls from, certain phone numbers they designate that are not part of the Verizon Wireless network (including domestic landline numbers) without the call time counting against their minute allowance. We adjust our plans periodically to address changing customer preferences and needs and to take advantage of the availability of new technology. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the United States.  Other Connection-Related Services We provide data access and enhanced value added services to support telemetry-type applications, which are characterized by machine-to-machine (M2M) wireless connections that typically do not include a voice component. Our M2M services support devices used by a variety of vertical market segments, such as healthcare, manufacturing, utilities, distribution and consumer products. For example, companies purchase data access and enhanced services from us in order to connect with and monitor equipment, such as medical devices used to monitor patients, fleet management devices that monitor company-operated vehicles and utility monitoring devices used for smart grid applications. Other companies purchase data access and enhanced services from us to support devices that are included in a service they in turn sell to end-users. We provide data access and enhanced value-added services to support telematics, which generally involve the integration of wireless safety and security, diagnostics, remote unlock/start-up and other services in vehicles. We support telematics services for some of the largest automotive manufacturers, and we are currently the national provider of wireless service for OnStar, a subsidiary of General Motors Company. Wireless Devices We offer several categories of wireless devices, including smartphones and basic phones, as well as tablets and other Internet access devices. Smartphones . Our device line-up includes an array of smartphones that are enabled to utilize our 3G EV-DO (Revision A) or 4G LTE high-speed data services and have operating platforms, such as Google Android, Apple iOS, BlackBerry OS, and Windows Mobile. Basic Phones . Some of our basic phones are 3G EV-DO-enabled and have HTML-browsing capability. Additionally, we offer a selection of basic phones that operate via our CDMA-1XRTT service. Tablets and Other Internet Access Devices. We offer a variety of 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO-enabled tablets from multiple manufacturers that run primarily on either the Apple iOS or Google Android operating systems. These tablets also permit our customers to access the Internet via a Wi-Fi connection. In addition, we offer dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO connection, which we refer to as Jetpack devices, capable of connecting up to five Wi-Fienabled devices to the Internet at one time. Our customers can also access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on their computers via data cards or through the use of certain laptop computers and netbooks with embedded 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO Mobile Broadband modules offered by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). During 2011, we continued to experience strong subscriber demand for tablets and Jetpack devices, which represented a larger proportion of our data revenue growth as compared to the prior year. We purchase wireless devices and accessories from a number of manufacturers, with the substantial majority of our purchases made from Apple, Motorola, Samsung, LG Electronics, RIM, Palm and PCD (through which we purchase Pantech and HTC devices and accessories). A key component of all wireless devices is the chipset, which contains the intelligence of the phone. Most of our wireless device suppliers rely on Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm) for manufacturing and supplying CDMA-1XRTT and EV-DO chipsets. We also sell phones that include CDMA-1XRTT and EV-DO chipsets manufactured by VIA Telecom under license from Qualcomm. The LTE chipsets used in our 4G LTE-enabled devices are manufactured by various companies, each using its own 4G LTE chipset technology. In addition, there are a number of other components common to wireless phones provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly. Strategic Initiatives We have undertaken several initiatives to develop innovative devices, data services and applications available to run on our networks, including the following: ##TABLE_START    LTE Innovation Center . We operate the Verizon LTE Innovation Center, which we believe serves as a catalyst for the early development of non-traditional devices and associated services and applications for use on 4G LTE networks. The center works with many of our strategic partners representing various industries to help them quickly bring products to market. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Application Innovation Center . The Verizon Application Innovation Center was established to allow developers to work on applications side-by-side with network experts from Verizon Wireless to create, optimize and polish their ideas and turn them into viable wireless applications. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    ISIS . ISIS is a joint venture with ATT and T-Mobile that is developing a mobile commerce platform that will enable customers to pay for point-of-sale purchases via their mobile phones using near field communications technology, rather than by paying with cash or a credit card. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    Comcast Corporation, Time Warner Cable, Bright House Networks and Verizon Wireless have formed a technology innovation joint venture for the development of technology and intellectual property to better integrate wireline and wireless products and services. ##TABLE_END Network Our network is among the largest in the United States, with licensed and operational coverage in all of the top 100 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas. Our network covered a population of approximately 296 million as of December 31, 2011. Our goal is to provide the highest network reliability for the provision of data and voice services. We design and deploy our data network in a manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions and completions of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds, and we design and deploy our voice network in a manner that we believe maximizes the number of calls by our customers that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped. We plan to continue to build out, expand and upgrade our network and explore strategic opportunities to expand our national network coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses. Technology Our primary network technology platforms are 4G LTE and 3G CDMA. 4G LTE provides higher throughput performance and improved efficiencies for data services than 3G technologies. We launched our 4G LTE network in December 2010, and by January 19, 2012 it was deployed in 195 markets covering more than 200 million people. By mid-2013, we expect that our 4G LTE network will have been deployed in virtually our entire 3G CDMA network footprint. We also plan to expand our 4G LTE coverage beyond our existing 3G CDMA footprint through our LTE in Rural America Program. Under this program, we are working with wireless carriers in rural areas to collaboratively build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carriers network assets and our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 MHz spectrum. We currently have 15 committed program participants that have the potential to provide 4G LTE coverage to more than two million people outside of our 4G LTE footprint. While competing wireless service providers are also migrating to LTE technology, we believe that we have a time-to-market and coverage advantage over these providers. Our 3G CDMA network is based on spread-spectrum digital radio technology. CDMA-1XRTT technology is deployed in virtually all of the cell sites in our 3G CDMA network. In addition, EV-DO, a 3G packet-based technology intended primarily for high-speed data transmission, is deployed in substantially all of the cell sites in our 3G CDMA network. Our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service. Power and backhaul transport facilities can often become a networks vulnerability. Consequently, we have battery backup at every switch and virtually every cell site in our network. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our cell sites and at every switch location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed to cell sites if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant backbone Multiprotocol Label Switching network in all critical locations. In September 2011, Verizon Wireless implemented network optimization practices designed to ensure that the overwhelming majority of our data customers are not negatively impacted by the unusually high data consumption of a few data users. Under these current practices, the top five percent of our 3G smartphone data users with unlimited data plans, as well as 3G data users roaming on our network, may experience a reduction in average data speeds when connected to a congested cell site. If a cell site is not congested, a users connection speed will not be impacted. Network optimization helps to ensure high quality network performance for our entire customer base. Spectrum The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services. We have licenses to provide wireless services on portions of the 800 MHz band (also known as cellular spectrum) and/or 1800-1900 MHz band (also known as PCS spectrum) in areas where virtually all of the population of the United States resides. In parts of the United States, we also have licenses for advanced wireless services (AWS) spectrum in segments of the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands. In addition, we hold licenses for portions of the 700 MHz band, including eight licenses that can, together, be used to provide wireless service coverage to the entire United States. We plan on using both our 700 MHz and AWS spectrum to provide advanced broadband services, and in late 2010 we began using certain of our 700 MHz licenses for that purpose in connection with the launch of our 4G LTE network. In addition to our licensed coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in virtually all other areas in the United States where wireless service is available. Certain of our roaming agreements are terminable at will by either party upon several months notice; however, we do not believe that the termination of any of these at-will agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business. We anticipate we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. This increasing demand is being driven by growth in customer connections and usage of wireless broadband services, which use more bandwidth and require ever faster rates of speed to stay competitive. We can meet spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), if and when offered by the FCC in future spectrum auctions. Although the availability of new spectrum for  commercial wireless services and the possible dates of future FCC spectrum auctions are unknown at this time, the FCC and the current Presidential Administration have been seeking the release of additional mobile use spectrum. In addition, Congress has recently adopted legislation that provides for the establishment of a national public safety network and the reallocation and auction, through the use of voluntary incentive auctions, by 2022 of portions of the existing broadcast spectrum. The timing and nature of those auctions will be determined by future regulatory proceedings. We have entered into agreements to acquire AWS spectrum licenses held by SpectrumCo, LLC and Cox TMI Wireless. During 2011, we also entered into agreements with a subsidiary of Leap Wireless and with Savary Island Wireless, which is majority-owned by Leap Wireless, for the purchase of certain of their AWS and PCS licenses in exchange for cash and our 700 MHz A block license in Chicago. The consummation of each of these transactions is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the FCC. As we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and have spectrum surpluses in others, we have at times arranged spectrum swaps, and we expect to have opportunities to benefit from spectrum license trades in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future. These swaps as well as any spectrum purchases are subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses in each instance. Network Equipment and Build-out Our primary cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are Alcatel-Lucent, which provides more than half of our cell site equipment, and Motorola and Ericsson, which together provide nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment. We also rely upon Alcatel-Lucent, Motorola and Ericsson for our switching equipment. Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our LTE network deployments. As we continue to build and upgrade our existing network, we must complete a variety of steps, including securing rights to a large number of cell site and switch site locations and obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals. In some instances, we have encountered difficulty in obtaining the necessary site leases at commercially reasonable rates and the zoning approvals needed to construct new towers. We utilize tower site management firms, such as Crown Castle International Corp. and American Tower Corporation, as lessors or managers of our existing tower sites upon which our operations depend. Marketing We focus our marketing strategy on offering solutions that are targeted to satisfy the needs of our various customer market groups; promoting our brand; leveraging our extensive distribution network; jointly marketing with Vodafone; and jointly marketing to enterprise customers with Verizons Wireline business units through Verizon Enterprise Solutions, a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of Verizons solutions for business and government customers globally. Our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television, print, radio, outdoor signage, Internet and point-of-sale media promotions designed to present our marketing message consistently across all of our markets. Our sales strategy is to use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs. We rely on third-party providers for device warehousing and distribution. Company-operated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy. Our direct channel, which includes our business-to-business operations and systems organization, is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of our local, regional and national business customers. We also have a dedicated organization to more effectively serve the needs of our largest corporate customers and our federal and other large government accounts. In addition, we have a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers, and we offer fully-automated, end-to-end web-based sales of wireless phones, accessories and service plans. Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the United States, as well as through the Internet. The majority of these agents sell our postpaid and prepaid products and services, and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us. In addition, we utilize high-profile, national retailers, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart, RadioShack and Target, to sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services. Stores such as Dollar General, Big Lots and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services. In December 2011, we entered into commercial agreements with affiliates of Comcast Corporation, Time Warner Cable, Bright House Networks and Cox Communications Inc. (the cable companies). Through these agreements, the cable companies and Verizon Wireless became agents to sell one anothers products and services and, over time, the cable companies will have the option, subject to the terms and conditions of the agreements to sell Verizon Wireless service on a wholesale basis. These agreements are currently under review by the Department of Justice. Competition We operate in a highly competitive industry. We compete against other national wireless service providers, including ATT, Sprint Nextel Corporation and T-Mobile USA, as well as various regional wireless service providers, including US Cellular, Metro PCS and Leap Wireless. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilities-based wireless service providers for resale, including those that buy from us. We expect competition to intensify as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels, the development and deployment of new technologies, the introduction of new products and services, new market entrants, the availability of additional spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, and regulatory changes. Competition may also increase if smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized and more experienced wireless service providers.  The wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services. For example, Microsoft, Google, Apple and others, are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless providers voice service. We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry: ##TABLE_START   Network reliability, capacity and coverage. We believe that a wireless network that consistently provides high quality and reliable service is a key differentiator in the U.S. market and a driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new data service offerings have led to increased customer usage of wireless services, which in turn puts pressure on network capacity. In order to compete effectively, wireless service providers must keep pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through their networks. We believe that the deployment of our 4G LTE network will help us to keep pace with network capacity requirements and meet customer demand for higher speeds. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Pricing. Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless data services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering service plans that include bundled data packages in varying megabyte or gigabyte sizes or, in some cases, unlimited data usage. In addition, certain wireless service providers are also offering minutes-sharing plans; free mobile-to-mobile calling; offerings of larger bundles of included minutes at attractive price points with no roaming or long distance charges; calling group features that enable customers to place and receive calls from a group of U.S. phone numbers they designate (including landline numbers) without the call time counting against their minute allotment; and both prepaid and postpaid plans offering unlimited voice and data usage. We seek to compete in this area by offering our customers services and equipment that they will regard as the best available value for the price, as well as service plans that meet their needs for both voice and data services. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Customer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting both new-to-wireless customers and customers of other wireless providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. Our competitors also recognize the importance of customer service and are also focused on improving it. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Product and service development. As wireless technologies develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate, continued customer and revenue growth will be increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced data products and services. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative wireless products and services both independently and in collaboration with application service providers. We also collaborate with various device manufacturers in the development of distinctive smartphones and other wireless devices that can access the growing array of data applications and content available over the Internet. We continue to focus on increasing smartphone penetration throughout our customer base. In addition to these devices, we also continue to expand international roaming agreements and offer significant coverage outside of the United States for customers that require a solution overseas. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Sales and distribution. Key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We believe that attaining the optimal combination of varying distribution channels is important to achieving industry-leading profitability, as measured by operating income. We endeavor to increase sales through our company-operated stores, outside sales teams and telemarketing and web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, as well as through our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations and netbook and notebook OEMs. In addition, we sell wireless access to both traditional resellers, which resell wireless services to their end-users, and to various companies to enable wireless communications for their M2M devices or for their provision of telematics services. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Capital resources. In order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services, wireless service providers require significant capital resources. We generate significant cash flow from operations, as do some of our competitors. ##TABLE_END Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry, including the factors described above, as well as new technologies, new business models, changes in customer preferences, regulatory changes, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors.  ##TABLE_START Wireline ##TABLE_END Background The Wireline segment provides customers with voice service including long distance, broadband video and data, IP network services, network access and other services. We provide these products and services to consumers and small businesses in the United States, as well as to businesses and government customers and carriers both in the United States and in over 150 other countries around the world. In 2011, Wireline revenues were $40.7 billion, representing approximately 37% of Verizons aggregate revenues. Wireline Service and Product Offerings We organize our service and product offerings by the primary market targeted by these offerings  mass markets, global enterprise, global wholesale and other. During 2011, we enhanced our offerings of cloud services by acquiring Terremark Worldwide Inc. (Terremark), a global provider of information technology infrastructure and cloud services, and by acquiring a provider of cloud software technology. These acquisitions improved Verizons competitive position in the managed hosting and cloud services space, enhanced our offerings to business and government customers globally and contributed to our growth in revenues. Mass Markets Mass Markets operations provide local exchange (basic service and end-user access) and long distance (including regional toll) voice services, broadband services (including high-speed Internet and FiOS Internet) and FiOS Video services to residential and small business subscribers. In 2011, Mass Markets revenues were $16.3 billion, representing approximately 40% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. Video Services. We offer video service over our fiber-optic network. As of December 31, 2011, FiOS Video is available to approximately 13 million homes across 12 states, as well as the District of Columbia. We believe FiOS Video has features that differentiate it from the competition, including its channel line-up, Interactive Media Guide, Home Media DVR and breadth of high definition content, as well as the following: ##TABLE_START    Flex View  With Flex View, FiOS customers can watch content anytime, anywhere, on any device. Customers who subscribe to FiOS Video and Internet also have the ability to upload their photos, music and videos to their personal Flex View Library, which gives them easy access to this content via any data-capable device. Our HBO GO offering provides customers with unlimited access to HBO programming on any data-capable device. Verizons FiOS Video subscribers can also access Turner Broadcastings online programming directly on the TBS and TNT sites and through Verizon FiOS Video Online. In addition, through FiOS TV Widgets, viewers have one-touch, on demand access to local weather, traffic and community information and popular social media applications, such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, as well as online commerce opportunities. The widget platform has evolved in an open-development environment, which provides opportunities for third parties to develop enhanced customer features via the FiOS Video product. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Home Monitoring and Control Solution  During the fourth quarter of 2011, we introduced the Home Monitoring and Control Solution, which allows FiOS customers to use any data-capable device to remotely operate key functions of their home, such as setting and controlling lights, thermostats and appliances. In addition, customers have the ability to monitor their home via networked cameras. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Xbox Interoperability  In October 2011, we announced a partnership with Microsoft Corporation to offer FiOS Video and broadband customers who also subscribe to the Xbox LIVE Gold online gaming service the ability to view popular live HD TV channels through their Xbox console without a set-top box or extra hardware. This technology further expands our initiative to provide customers with the ability to watch content anytime, anywhere, on any data-capable device. ##TABLE_END In February 2012, a new joint venture between Verizon and Coinstar, Inc. was announced. At the outset, Verizon will hold a 65% majority ownership share and Redbox Automated Retail, LLC, a subsidiary of Coinstar, Inc. will hold a 35% ownership share. The joint venture will be consolidated by Verizon for reporting purposes. The joint venture will offer access to physical media rentals through Redbox kiosks and online and mobile content streaming from Verizon to consumers across the country. The joint venture plans to introduce its product portfolio, which will include subscription services, in mid-2012. The initial funding related to the formation of the joint venture is not significant to Verizon. Data Services. We offer high-speed Internet and FiOS broadband data products with varying downstream and upstream processing speeds. Our customers can order FiOS Internet with speeds of up to 150 Mbps downstream and 35 Mbps upstream, which is currently the fastest mass-market broadband service in the United States.

We are currently conducting an assessment and enhancement project of our Global Enterprise operating model to allow us to continue to be competitive in the information and communication technology market. The goal of this project is to improve the customer experience, our geographic balance, and the global consistency of our operations and to transform our business models and our talent in order to further grow our revenues and our business.  Global Wholesale Global Wholesale provides communications services including data, voice and local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local, long distance and other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers. In 2011, Global Wholesale revenues were $8.0 billion, representing approximately 20% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. A portion of Global Wholesale revenues is generated by a few large telecommunication companies, most of who compete directly with us. Global Wholesale provides the following services, which it jointly markets with Verizons other business units through Verizon Enterprise Solutions: ##TABLE_START    Data Services. We offer a robust portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance our wholesale customers networks and provide connections to their end users and subscribers. Our data services include high-speed digital data offerings, such as Ethernet and Synchronous Optical Network, as well as core data circuits, such as DS1/DS3. In addition, data services include special access revenues that are generated from carriers that buy dedicated local exchange capacity to support their private networks. ##TABLE_END Our wireless customers in the United States represent the largest growth opportunity in wholesale, as we build backhaul connections from their cell sites to mobile switching centers. These customers are also migrating networks from time division multiplexing (TDM) to Ethernet, which will better scale and service the growth of broadband services driven by smartphones, mobile broadband and mobile video. Global Wholesale offers a complete suite of services to support the expansion of 3G networks and the roll-out of 4G networks. Data Services also includes certain value-added business services, which leverage many of the same offerings available in the Global Enterprise portfolio, including: ##TABLE_START     Managed Services  Offers wholesale customers the opportunity to outsource the management of their networks, security, remote access, and web applications to Verizon; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START     Mobility  Enables wholesale customers to enhance their portfolio to triple-play or quad-play capability by leveraging wireless devices and services offered through Verizon Wireless and packaged and resold under their own carrier brand; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START     Security  Provides wholesale customers integrated solutions to help their enterprise end-users secure their networks and data. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Voice Services .

We offer an array of local dial tone and broadband services to competitive local exchange carriers, some of which are offered to comply with telecommunications regulations. In addition, we offer services such as collocation, resale and unbundled network elements in compliance with applicable regulations. ##TABLE_END Other Other services include such services as local exchange and long distance services derived from former MCI mass market customers, operator services, card services and supply sales, as well as dial around services including 10-10-987, 10-10-220 and prepaid cards. In 2011, Other revenues were $0.8 billion, representing approximately 2% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. Network In order to provide services to our customers, we operate an advanced telecommunications network in the United States and around the world. FiOS . We are well on the way toward our goal of being the premier broadband and entertainment service provider in our service areas, and we know network reliability and expanded functionality are key to achieving that objective. We offer Americas fastest Internet with speeds up to 150Mbps utilizing Fiber-to-the-Premise (FTTP) access technologies over fiber optic cables. Our network architecture also provides the flexibility to adapt our facilities more easily to future product development. For example, new optical terminals can be added to the FTTP network providing greater bandwidth and new services without any additional field construction. Field trials have successfully achieved connection speeds of nearly 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) downstream and upstream, and when a more advanced XG-PON2 technology was connected to the fiber-optic network, connection speeds of 10 Gbps were reached, demonstrating the significant capacity built into the FiOS network. The Verizon FiOS network now carries 130 high definition television channels, over 30 thousand video-on-demand titles, 3,800 high definition titles and continues groundbreaking advances in 3D technology. ESPN 3D was the first 24/7 3D channel, and Verizon recently took another first step in 3D programming with the first televised live 3D college football game. New FiOS service offerings also continue to eliminate the barrier between home and away. The introduction of the MY FiOS mobile application provides Verizon FiOS customers on-the-go access to entertainment, personal content, TV controls, home monitoring, customer service tools and more. Examples of how Verizon customers can use  MY FiOS include: viewing a live camera feed when away from home using our new Home Monitoring and Control service; selecting from the latest movies available on Flex View and for viewing on a laptop or other mobile device; remotely scheduling a DVR to record a favorite TV show; or sharing photos and videos using Media Manager. Global IP . We have expanded our Virtual Private LAN service to Europe, Asia-Pacific and additional North American locations. We have focused on the expansion of our private IP network to serve all key international markets with Quality of Service-aware IP Virtual Private Network managed services. Our Public IP network is now interconnected to our private IP network through Security Gateway platforms that allow business customers to extend the reach of their private virtual networks to off-net sites, such as employees homes, small branch offices and mobile work forces. We have installed additional private IP edge routers for a total of 988 edge routers in 251 sites throughout 66 countries. We also activated most of the links in the Europe India Gateway system in 2011, linking countries/territories between Europe, the Middle East and India, thereby delivering significant network capacity and diversity into emerging international markets. We deployed the industrys first commercial 100G (gigabits per second) ultra-long-haul optical system for live traffic on our European optical core network in 2010, and followed that up with another industry first in 2011 with initial deployments of 100G technology on our U.S. backbone network. During 2012, approximately 7,000 additional route miles of the domestic ultra-long-haul backbone network will be upgraded to 100G capable systems. Fiber-to-the-Cellsite . Our FTTCS Ethernet backhaul initiative is critical to supporting the substantial growth requirements of expanding 3G and 4G LTE wireless data networks nationwide. To support this initiative, over 18,000 total cell site connections have been completed since the start of this program. In conjunction with the evolution of our access plant, we are also transitioning our metro (local) network infrastructure from traditional TDM/SONET (Synchronous Optical Network)/ATM technologies to Ethernet over Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM). This new optical transport network provides features optimized for video distribution services and high-speed data services, while maintaining the level of network reliability achieved with SONET. To leverage this new network infrastructure and allow for the more efficient sharing of our network across services, we are upgrading our multiplexing and routing infrastructure to use IP, Ethernet and MPLS technologies. In addition, we are migrating from traditional TDM-based voice switching to VoIP. This migration lowers the cost of current data and voice services and creates a network that can offer future multi-media communications services by adding service platforms without requiring widespread network upgrades. We have been focused on growing our Ethernet infrastructure to support the full range of Ethernet private line and E-LAN services locally, domestically and globally. To lower the access cost and provide significant service flexibility, we are using a converged packet access strategy that replaces the private circuit-based customer access and aggregates traffic from multiple customers onto a shared Ethernet and MPLS network. We also continue to focus on emerging optical transport technologies to lower overall cost as we integrate Ethernet, SONET and Optics and ultra-long-haul technologies. Competition The wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify further with traditional, non-traditional and emerging players seeking increased market share. Current and potential competitors include cable companies, wireless service providers, other domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, Internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. In the Mass Markets business, cable operators are significant competitors. Cable operators have increased the size and digital capacity of their networks so that they can offer digital products and services. We continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include high-speed Internet access, digital television and voice services. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. In addition, wireless substitution is an ongoing competitive trend, which we expect to continue as wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from companies that provide VoIP services, which are available from a wide range of companies including cable companies, and national and regional providers. Internet portal providers are also entering our competitive space. As a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which requires us to allow potential competitors to purchase our services for resale or access components of our network on an unbundled basis at a prescribed cost, competition in our local exchange markets continues. Our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to competitive local exchange carriers at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers. The scope of these obligations going forward and the rates we receive are subject to ongoing review and revision by the FCC and state regulators. (See Regulatory and Competitive Trends in the 2011 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners.)  In the Global Enterprise business, the customers need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is driving the expansion of the competitive landscape. Major competitors include system integrators, carriers and hardware and software providers. Some of the biggest companies in IT services are either making acquisitions or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending. Most new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing, software delivery, communication applications and other computing tasks via the network, rather than on in-house machines. Carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major IT outsourcers. Global Wholesale competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity. In addition, companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and, to a lesser extent, global wholesale markets. We compete with these full or near-full service providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have a strong market presence, brand recognition, and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition and which may affect our future revenue growth. We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry: ##TABLE_START   Customer Service: Customers expect industry-leading service from their service providers. As technologies and services evolve, the ability of a carrier to excel in this area is very important for customer acquisition and retention. In Mass Markets, we compete in this area through our service representatives and online support. In Global Enterprise, we provide our customers with ready access to their system and performance information and we conduct proactive testing of our network to identify minor issues before they affect customers. In the Wholesale business, service improvement can be achieved through continued system automation initiatives. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Network reliability and bandwidth (speed): As both consumers and small business customers look to leverage high-speed connections for entertainment, communications and productivity, we expect broadband penetration will continue to increase over the next several years. As online and online-enabled activities increase, so will bandwidth requirements, both downstream and upstream. To succeed, we and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can deliver against these increasing bandwidth requirements. We continue to invest in our network to be able to meet this future demand. In addition, network reliability and security are increasingly important competitive factors in the Global Enterprise business. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Pricing: Cable, telecommunications companies and integrated service providers use pricing to capture market share from incumbents. Pricing is also a significant factor as non-traditional modes of providing communication services emerge and new entrants compete for customers. For example, portal-based and VoIP calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Product differentiation: As a result of pricing pressures, providers need to differentiate their products and services. Customers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband and video connections. Converged features, such as integrated wireless and wireline functionality, are becoming similarly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START Patents, Trademarks and Licenses ##TABLE_END Verizon owns or has licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad, and have significantly increased the rate of such filings each year. Verizon also actively grants licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable such companies to utilize certain Verizon intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable such third party licensees to take advantage of the results of Verizons research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to Verizon, we do not believe that loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations. Verizon periodically receives offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, or cease offering the relevant products or services. ##TABLE_START Acquisitions and Divestitures ##TABLE_END Acquisitions and Divestitures on page 46 of the 2011 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners is incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_START Regulatory and Competitive Trends ##TABLE_END Regulatory and Competitive Trends included in Other Factors That May Affect Future Results on pages 47 through 49 of the 2011 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners is incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_START Environmental Matters ##TABLE_END Environmental Matters included in Other Factors That May Affect Future Results on page 49 of the 2011 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners is incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_START Executive Officers ##TABLE_END See Part III, Item 10.

Risk Factors ##TABLE_END The following discussion of Risk Factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition or future performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations. Unfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or in one or more of our other major markets, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. Similarly, under these conditions the business customers that we serve in the United States and abroad may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We face significant competition that may reduce our market share and lower our profits. We face significant competition in our industry. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated the traditional distinctions between local, long distance, wireless, cable and Internet communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, application and device providers, electric utilities, and providers of VoIP services. While these changes have enabled us to offer new types of services, they have also allowed other service providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our services and equipment, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to successfully respond to these competitive challenges, we could lose market share and experience reduced profits. If we are not able to take advantage of technological developments in the telecommunications industry on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits. Our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. In general, the development of new services in our industry requires us to anticipate and respond to the varied and continually changing demands of our customers. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints to our introduction of new services. If our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. For example, we have selected Long Term Evolution technology (LTE) as our next-generation wireless network access technology. Our ability to continue to deploy our 4G LTE network successfully and in a timely manner depends on various factors that are beyond our control, including the risk that our suppliers may be unable to manufacture and deliver 4G LTE network equipment on schedule and according to our specifications. Furthermore, our deployment of 4G LTE may not occur at the cost we have estimated. If these risks materialize, our ability to provide next generation wireless services to our customers, to retain and attract customers, and to maintain and grow our customer revenues could be materially adversely affected. In addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits.  We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as switch and network equipment, handsets and other devices and equipment, that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. For example, our handset and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices. If these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers. We also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. Because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry. We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology. Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict our ability to operate in or provide specified products or services in designated areas and require that we maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are frequently involved in regulatory and non-regulatory governmental proceedings related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Unless we are able to obtain appropriate relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful at obtaining the licenses we need to carry out our business strategy or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years that are subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our wireless business, results of operations and financial condition. The adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal or state level could also adversely affect our business plans. New regulations could restrict the ways in which we can manage our wireline and wireless networks, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. For example, the development of new technologies, such as IP-based services, including VoIP and super high-speed broadband and video, could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology. As the holder of 700 MHz C Block licenses, we are required to comply with certain open access regulations that the FCC has imposed on all licensees of 700 MHz C Block spectrum. These rules require us to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice on the LTE network we are deploying on that spectrum, including those obtained from sources other than us or our distributors or dealers, subject to certain technical limitations established by us. In addition, on December 21, 2010, the FCC adopted an order in which it imposed so-called net neutrality rules that it describes as intended to preserve the openness of the Internet. These new rules, which took effect in November 2011 and are subject to a pending appeal, will limit the ways that a broadband Internet access service provider can manage its network and the services it can provide over the network. Given that the scope of the restrictions and many critical terms in the open access and net neutrality rules are not fully defined and given that the rules create procedural mechanisms for parties to complain of violations, it is reasonable to expect litigation to resolve ambiguities, which could lead to yet further regulation. The regulation of broadband activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our broadband networks.  Breaches of network or information technology security, natural disasters or terrorist attacks could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology (IT) security, natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war may cause equipment failures or disrupt our operations. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share to other communications providers. In particular, both unsuccessful and successful cyber attacks on companies have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. The costs associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cyber security measures, lost revenues from business interruption, litigation and damage to our reputation. Further, certain of Verizons businesses, including the provisioning of security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. In addition, if we fail to prevent the theft of valuable information such as financial data, sensitive information about the Company and intellectual property, or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against breaches of network or IT security, it could result in damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence. Any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could affect our access to financing. Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. With approximately 193,900 employees and approximately 209,400 retirees as of December 31, 2011 participating in Verizons benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts or additional organizing activity. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 30% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. Labor contracts covering many of our union employees expired on August 6, 2011, at which time Verizon experienced a 14-day work stoppage. The Company and the unions then entered into a Return to Work agreement pursuant to which the employees returned to work under the terms and conditions of the previous contracts indefinitely; however, either the Company or the unions may terminate the contract extensions after providing seven (7) days notice. We continue to be engaged in negotiations with our unions regarding new contracts. Depending on the course of these negotiations, we could incur additional costs and/or experience additional work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations, including through a loss of revenue and strained relationships with customers. In addition, while the workforce of our wireless business is almost entirely non-union, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our costs. We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. Our business faces a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements.  ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Substantially all the switching centers are located on land and in buildings we own due to their critical role in the network and high set-up relocation costs. We also maintain facilities throughout the United States comprised of administrative and sales offices, customer care centers, retail sales locations, switching centers, cell sites and data centers. Furniture and other consists of telephone equipment, furniture, data processing equipment, office equipment, motor vehicles, plant under construction, capitalized non-network computer software costs and leasehold improvements. A portion of our property is subject to the liens of their respective mortgages securing funded debt.  ##TABLE_START ", "3": " Item 3. Legal Proceedings ##TABLE_END Verizon and a number of other telecommunications companies, have been the subject of multiple class action suits concerning their alleged participation in intelligence-gathering activities allegedly carried out by the federal government, at the direction of the President of the United States, as part of the governments post-September 11 program to prevent terrorist attacks. Plaintiffs generally allege that Verizon has participated by permitting the government to gain access to the content of its subscribers telephone calls and/or records concerning those calls and that such action violates federal and/or state constitutional and statutory law. Relief sought in the cases includes injunctive relief, attorneys fees, and statutory and punitive damages. On August 9, 2006, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (Panel) ordered that these actions be transferred, consolidated and coordinated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The Panel subsequently ordered that a number of tag along actions also be transferred to the Northern District of California. Verizon believes that these lawsuits are without merit. On July 10, 2008, the President signed into law the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which provides for dismissal of these suits by the court based on submission by the Attorney General of the United States of a specified certification. On September 19, 2008, the Attorney General made such a submission in the consolidated proceedings. Based on this submission, the court ordered dismissal of the complaints on June 3, 2009. Plaintiffs appealed this dismissal, and by decision issued December 29, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal. Plaintiffs have not petitioned the United States Supreme Court to review the decision, but their time to do so has not yet expired. On September 15, 2010, the U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bank), as Litigation Trustee for the Idearc Inc. Litigation Trust (Litigation Trust), filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against Verizon and certain subsidiaries challenging the November 2006 spin-off of Verizons former directories business then known as Idearc Inc. U.S. Bank, which represents a group of creditors who filed claims in the Idearc Inc. bankruptcy proceedings, alleges that Idearc Inc. was insolvent at the time of the spin-off or became insolvent shortly thereafter. The Litigation Trust seeks over $9 billion in damages. Discovery in the case is underway, with a trial set for October 2012. On October 25, 2011, a Litigation Trust created during the bankruptcy proceedings of FairPoint Communications, Inc. filed a complaint in state court in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, against Verizon and other related entities, including Verizon Wireless. The complaint claims that FairPoints acquisition of Verizons landline operations in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont in March 2008 was structured and carried out in a way that left FairPoint insolvent or lead to its insolvency shortly thereafter and ultimately to its October 2009 bankruptcy. The Litigation Trust seeks approximately $2 billion in damages. Verizon removed the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina in November 2011. A trial date has not yet been set and neither motion practice nor discovery has begun.  ##TABLE_START PART II ", "4": "", "5": " Item 5.

On February 3, 2011, the Board approved a share buyback program which authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of Verizon common stock terminating no later than the close of business on February 28, 2014. The Board also determined that no additional shares were to be purchased under the previously authorized buyback program. The program permits Verizon to repurchase shares over time, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs. The Board may also enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans from time to time to facilitate repurchases of its shares under this authorization. A Rule 10b5-1 plan permits the Company to repurchase shares at times when it might otherwise be prevented from doing so, provided the plan is adopted when the Company is not aware of material non-public information. During the fourth quarter of 2011, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon common stock. At December 31, 2011, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 100 million.

Verizon owns a controlling 55% interest in Verizon Wireless and Vodafone owns the remaining 45%. Verizon Wireless provides wireless communication services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States and has the largest third-generation (3G) EvolutionData Optimized (EV-DO) and fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution technology (LTE) networks of any U.S. wireless service provider. Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless service provider in the United States as measured by retail connections and revenue. At December 31, 2012, Verizon Wireless had 98.2 million retail connections and 2012 revenues of approximately $75.9 billion, representing approximately 66% of Verizons 2012 aggregate revenues. As of January 22, 2013, our 4G LTE network has been deployed in 476 markets covering more than 273 million people throughout the country, which is nearly 89% of the U.S. population. We expect to continue to deploy 4G LTE during 2013 and by year-end cover nearly our entire existing 3G network footprint. Our 4G LTE network provides higher data throughput performance for data services at lower cost compared to those offered by 3G technologies. As of December 31, 2012, nearly 50% of our wireless data traffic was on our 4G LTE network. Wireless Service and Product Offerings Our wireless services described below are available to our customers receiving service under the Verizon Wireless brand. In addition, customers can obtain wireless products and services that operate on our network from resellers that purchase network access from us on a wholesale basis.  Wireless Services We offer our wireless services on a postpaid and prepaid basis. Retail (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts represent retail customers that are under contract with Verizon Wireless directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and use its branded services. Accounts include single connection plans, family plans, Share Everything  plans and corporate accounts. A single account may receive monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. Postpaid connections represent individual lines of service for which a customer is billed in advance a monthly access charge in return for a monthly network service allowance (access service revenues), and usage beyond the allowance is billed in arrears (usage service revenues). Approximately 94% of our retail connections received our wireless services on a postpaid basis as of December 31, 2012. Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless services without a long-term contract or credit verification by paying for all services in advance. In 2012, Verizon Wireless launched the Share Everything plans, which were made available to both new and existing postpaid customers. These plans feature domestic unlimited voice minutes, unlimited text, video and picture messaging and a single data allowance that can be shared among up to 10 devices connected to the Verizon Wireless network. For an additional monthly access fee, our customers have the option of sharing long distance and roaming minutes among their devices for calls from the United States to, and calls while within, Canada and Mexico. The Share Everything plans also include the Mobile Hotspot service on our smartphones at no additional charge. The Mobile Hotspot service allows a customer to use our network to create a Wi-Fi network that can be used by Wi-Fi enabled devices. In January 2013, Verizon Wireless announced it will begin offering shared data plans for business, with the Share Everything plans for Small Business and the Nationwide Business Data Packages and Plans. As of December 31, 2012, Share Everything accounts represented approximately 23% of our retail postpaid accounts. As wireless service providers continue to upgrade their networks to enhance data-carrying capabilities and to permit higher-speed data transmission, the demand for full Internet browsing capabilities for phones and the proliferation of wireless applications for wireless-enabled laptops, phones and other wireless devices is increasing and driving data transport access and usage revenue. This growing demand for wireless services has, in turn, spurred the demand for still higher-speed network technologies and the development of an array of more advanced wireless devices that include more robust functionality. We offer access to a wide variety of wireless services, including Internet access via our broad range of devices. Our customers can access the Internet on all of our smartphones, as well as our basic phones that include HTML web-browsing capability. Our customers pay for this access under plans and arrangements that may vary based on the type of device and the customers preference for network access. We offer various packages of wireless services that allow customers, regardless of the device, to select the plan that best matches their network usage patterns. Our pricing models offer customers options for smartphones, basic phones, tablets and other devices. We also offer service that enables our customers to access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets that either have embedded 4G LTE or 3G EV-DO modules, or that are used in conjunction with separate devices that enable access to this service, such as smartphones and USB modems as well as Jetpacks  and other dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection. These devices can be added to the customers Share Everything plan for an additional monthly fee, or the customer can obtain a separate plan for the device at various price points, depending upon both the size of the data allowance purchased and the device covered by the plan. In addition, we offer messaging services, which enable our customers to send and receive text, picture and video messages. Our consumer-focused multimedia offerings, which are primarily provided via third-party arrangements, consist of applications providing music, video, gaming, news and other content to our customers, while our business-focused offerings, which are designed to increase the productivity of our business customers, include solutions that enable customers to access the Internet and their corporate intranets, as well as products that enable wireless e-mail across our diverse portfolio of wireless devices. Our location-based services provide our customers with directions to their destination and enable our business customers to locate, monitor and communicate with their mobile field workers. Our global data services allow our customers to access their e-mail on our Global Ready Phones from hundreds of international destinations and to access the Internet at such destinations with laptops that are either Global Ready, tethered to a Global Ready Phone, or are used in conjunction with other Global Ready devices, such as certain USB data modems or Jetpacks. Our customers can make and receive calls on their home phone handsets using our wireless network through our Home Phone Connect service. We also offer HomeFusion  Broadband, which is a high-speed Internet service that provides customers with Internet connections in their homes using our 4G LTE network. In addition to the foregoing offerings, our customers have access to hundreds of thousands of applications and services developed and distributed by third parties, such as those offered via Google Play, accessible on our smartphones running on the Google, Inc. (Google) Android operating system, those offered via the Apple, Inc. (Apple) iTunes store, accessible through smartphones and tablets running on the Apple iOS operating system, those offered by Microsoft Inc. (Microsoft), via Microsofts Windows Phone OS operating system and those offered by Research in Motion Limited (RIM) doing business as Blackberry, through its BlackBerry App World webstore. We offer a variety of plans for voice services and features with competitive pricing tailored to meet the needs of our customers. Our Share Everything plans allow customers to place unlimited domestic calls using our network. We adjust our plans periodically to address changing customer preferences and needs and to take advantage of the availability of new technology. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the United States.  In addition, we provide network access and enhanced value added services to support telemetry-type applications, which are characterized by machine-to-machine (M2M) wireless connections. Our M2M services support devices that are used by a variety of vertical market segments, including healthcare, manufacturing, utilities, distribution and consumer products. For example, companies purchase network access and enhanced services from us in order to connect with and monitor equipment, such as medical devices used to monitor patients, fleet management devices used to monitor company-operated vehicles and utility monitoring devices used for smart grid applications. Other companies purchase network access and enhanced services from us to support devices that are included in a service they, in turn, sell to end-users. We also support telematics services for some of the largest automotive manufacturers. We expect that consumer use of M2M wireless connections will increase as consumers take advantage of such services as home monitoring, health care, energy management and utilities management. Wireless Devices We offer several categories of wireless devices, including smartphones, tablets and other Internet access devices as well as basic phones. Smartphones . Our device line-up includes an array of smartphones that are enabled to utilize our 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO high-speed data services and run under various operating platforms, such as Google Android, Apple iOS, BlackBerry OS, and Windows Phone OS. Tablets and Other Internet Access Devices. We offer a variety of 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO-enabled tablets from multiple manufacturers that run primarily on either the Apple iOS or Google Android operating system. These tablets also permit our customers to access the Internet via a Wi-Fi connection. In addition, we offer dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO connection, which we refer to as Jetpacks capable of connecting multiple Wi-Fienabled devices to the Internet at one time. Our customers can also access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on their computers via data cards, USB modems or through the use of certain laptop computers and netbooks with embedded 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO Mobile Broadband modules offered by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). During 2012, we continued to experience strong subscriber demand for tablets and Jetpacks, which continued to represent a growing proportion of our revenue growth. Basic Phones . Some of our basic phones are 3G EV-DO-enabled and have HTML-browsing capability. We also offer a selection of basic phones that operate via our CDMA-1XRTT service. We purchase wireless devices and accessories from a number of manufacturers, with the substantial majority of our purchases made from Apple, Motorola Mobility, Samsung, LG Electronics, RIM, and PCD (through which we purchase Pantech and HTC devices and accessories). A key component of all wireless devices is the chipset, which contains the intelligence of the device. Most of our wireless device suppliers rely on Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm) for manufacturing and supplying CDMA-1XRTT and EV-DO chipsets. We also sell phones that include CDMA-1XRTT and EV-DO chipsets manufactured by VIA Telecom under license from Qualcomm. The LTE chipsets used in our 4G LTE-enabled devices are manufactured by various companies, each using its own 4G LTE chipset technology. In addition, there are a number of other components common to wireless phones provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly. Strategic Initiatives We have undertaken several initiatives to develop innovative devices, data services and applications available to run on our networks, including the following: ##TABLE_START    Innovation centers. We operate innovation centers in Waltham, Massachusetts and San Francisco. We believe our centers serve as catalysts for the development of non-traditional devices, services and applications that take full advantage of our 4G LTE network. The centers work with many of our strategic partners representing various industries to help them quickly bring products, services and applications to market. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Isis . Isis is a mobile commerce platform launched on a trial basis in 2012 as a joint venture with ATT Inc. (ATT) and T-Mobile USA, Inc. (T-Mobile) that enables customers to pay for point-of-sale purchases via their mobile phones using near field communications technology rather than by paying with cash or a credit card. Known as the ISIS Mobile Wallet, this service enables customers to organize all of their payment cards, offers and loyalty cards in one convenient application on their Isis-ready phone. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Converged solutions. In 2011, Verizon Wireless entered into commercial agreements, modified in 2012, with affiliates of Comcast Corporation, Time Warner Cable, Bright House Networks and Cox Communications Inc. (the cable companies). Through these agreements, the cable companies and Verizon Wireless became agents to sell certain of one anothers products and services and, over time, the cable companies will have the option, subject to the terms and conditions of the agreements, of selling Verizon Wireless service on a wholesale basis. Additionally, Comcast, Time Warner, Bright House and Verizon Wireless have formed an innovation technology joint venture for the development of technology to better integrate wireline and wireless products and services. ##TABLE_END Network We have the largest 3G EV-DO and 4G LTE networks of any service provider in the United States, with licensed and operational coverage in all of the top 100 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas, covering a population of approximately 298 million as of December 31, 2012.  We strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for their wireless services. We design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions and completions of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds, and that maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped. We plan to continue to build out, expand and upgrade our network as well as explore strategic opportunities to expand our national network coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses. In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the United States where wireless service is available. Certain of our roaming agreements are terminable at will by either party upon several months notice; however, we do not believe that the termination of any of these at-will agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business. Technology Our primary network technology platforms are 4G LTE and 3G CDMA. 4G LTE provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to those offered by 3G technologies. We expect to continue to deploy 4G LTE during 2013 and by year-end cover nearly our entire existing 3G network footprint. We also are working to expand 4G LTE coverage beyond our network footprint through our LTE in Rural America Program. Under this program, we are working with wireless carriers in rural areas to collaboratively build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carriers network assets and our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 MHz C-Block spectrum. We currently have 20 committed program participants that have the potential to provide 4G LTE coverage to more than two million people under the program and, to date, seven participants have commenced operations on such networks. In 2012, we began testing our mobile VoIP (voice over internet protocol) network known as Voice over LTE (VoLTE). This technology, which is expected to be used in addition to the current voice technology, is anticipated to result in high quality of voice service as a result of our 4G LTE network. We expect to launch VoLTE for commercial use by early 2014. Our 3G CDMA network is based on spread-spectrum digital radio technology. CDMA-1XRTT technology is deployed in nearly all of the cell sites in our 3G CDMA network. In addition, EV-DO, a 3G packet-based technology intended primarily for high-speed data transmission, is deployed in substantially all of the cell sites in our 3G CDMA network. Our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service. Power and backhaul transport facilities can often become a networks vulnerability. Consequently, we have battery backup at every switch and every cell site in our network. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our cell sites and at every switch location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed to cell sites if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant backbone Multiprotocol Label Switching network in all critical locations. In September 2011, Verizon Wireless implemented network optimization practices designed to ensure that the overwhelming majority of our data customers are not negatively impacted by the unusually high data consumption of a few data users. Under these current practices, the top five percent of our 3G smartphone data users with unlimited data plans, as well as 3G data users roaming on our network, may experience a reduction in average data speeds when connected to a congested cell site. If a cell site is not congested, a users connection speed will not be impacted. Network optimization helps to ensure high quality network performance for our entire customer base. Spectrum The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services. We have licenses to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 MHz band (also known as cellular spectrum), the 1800-1900 MHz band (also known as PCS spectrum) and the 1700 and 2100 MHz band (also known as AWS spectrum) in areas that, collectively, cover nearly all of the population of the United States. In addition, we hold licenses for portions of the 700 MHz band, including eight licenses that can, together, be used to provide wireless service coverage to the entire United States. In 2012, Verizon Wireless acquired Advanced Wireless Service (AWS) spectrum in separate transactions with SpectrumCo, LLC and Cox TMI Wireless, LLC for which it paid an aggregate of $3.9 billion at the time of the closings. During 2012, Verizon Wireless also completed license purchase and exchange transactions with Leap Wireless, Savary Island Wireless, which is majority owned by Leap Wireless, and a subsidiary of T-Mobile. As a result of these transactions, Verizon Wireless received an aggregate $2.6 billion of AWS and PCS licenses at fair value and transferred certain AWS licenses to T-Mobile and a 700 megahertz (MHz) lower A block license to Leap Wireless. On April 18, 2012, we announced plans to initiate an open sale process for all of our 700 MHz lower A and B block spectrum licenses, subject to the receipt of acceptable bids. We acquired these licenses as part of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Auction 73 in 2008. On January 25, 2013, Verizon Wireless agreed to sell 39 lower 700 MHz B block spectrum licenses to ATT in exchange for a payment of $1.9 billion and the transfer by ATT to Verizon Wireless of AWS (10 MHz) licenses in certain markets in the western United States. Verizon Wireless also agreed to sell certain lower 700 MHz B block spectrum licenses to an investment firm for a payment of $0.2 billion. These transactions are subject to approval by the FCC and the Department of Justice (DOJ). When finalized, the sales will result in the completion of the open sale process. We expect to deploy the remaining licenses as necessary to meet our own spectrum needs.  During the fourth quarter of 2012, we entered into license exchange agreements with T-Mobile and Cricket License Company, LLC, a subsidiary of Leap Wireless, to exchange certain AWS licenses. These non-cash exchanges, which are subject to approval by the FCC and other customary closing conditions, are expected to close in 2013. The exchange includes a number of intra-market swaps that will result in more efficient use of the AWS band. As a result of these transactions, we expect to record an immaterial gain. We anticipate we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. This increasing demand is being driven by growth in customer connections and usage of wireless broadband services, which use more bandwidth and require ever faster rates of speed to stay competitive. We can meet spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when offered by the FCC in future spectrum auctions. Although the availability of new spectrum for commercial wireless services and the possible dates of future FCC spectrum auctions are uncertain at this time, the FCC and the current Presidential Administration have been seeking the release of additional mobile use spectrum. In addition, Congress has adopted legislation that provides for the establishment of a national public safety network and the reallocation and auction, through the use of voluntary incentive auctions, by 2022 of portions of the existing broadcast spectrum. The timing and nature of those auctions will be determined by future regulatory proceedings. As we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and may have spectrum surpluses in others, we have at times exchanged spectrum licenses with other service providers through secondary market swap transactions, we expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future. In other cases, Verizon Wireless has entered into intra-market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency. These swaps as well as any spectrum purchases are subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses in each instance. Network Equipment and Build-out Our primary cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are Alcatel-Lucent, which provides more than half of our cell site equipment, and Motorola and Ericsson, which together provide nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment. We also rely upon Alcatel-Lucent, Motorola and Ericsson for our switching equipment. Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our LTE network deployments. As we continue to build and upgrade our existing network, we must complete a variety of steps, including securing rights to a large number of cell site and switch site locations and obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals. In some instances, we have encountered difficulty in obtaining the necessary site leases at commercially reasonable rates and the zoning approvals needed to construct new towers. We utilize tower site management firms, such as Crown Castle International Corp. and American Tower Corporation, as lessors or managers of our existing tower sites upon which our operations depend. Marketing and Distribution Our marketing strategy is focused on offering solutions tailored to the needs of our various customer market groups; promoting our brand; leveraging our extensive distribution network; jointly marketing with Vodafone; and jointly marketing our products and services to large business and government customers with Verizons Wireline business units through Verizon Enterprise Solutions, a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of Verizons solutions for medium and large business and government customers globally. Our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television, print, radio, outdoor signage, Internet and point-of-sale media promotions designed to present our corporate message consistently across all of our markets. We use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs. Company-operated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy. Our direct channel, which includes our business-to-business operations and systems organization, is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of consumers and local, regional and national business customers. In addition, we have a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers, and we offer fully-automated, end-to-end web-based sales of wireless phones, accessories and service plans. Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the United States, as well as through the Internet. The majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services, and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us. We also utilize high-profile, national retailers, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart, RadioShack and Target, to sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services. Stores such as Dollar General and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services. We have also entered into agency agreements with a number of broadband, video and voice service providers through which our products and services are sold on a stand-alone basis or bundled with their services. Competition We operate in a highly competitive industry. We compete against other national wireless service providers, including ATT, Sprint Nextel Corporation and T-Mobile USA, as well as various regional wireless service providers, including US Cellular, Metro PCS and Leap Wireless. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilities-based wireless service providers for resale, including those that buy from us. We expect competition to intensify as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels, the development and deployment of new technologies, the introduction of new products and services, new market entrants, the availability of additional spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, and regulatory changes. Competition may also increase if smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized and more experienced wireless service providers.  The wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services. For example, Microsoft, Google, Apple and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless providers voice service. We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry: ##TABLE_START   Network reliability, capacity and coverage . We believe that a wireless network that consistently provides high quality and reliable service is a key differentiator in the U.S. market and a driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new wireless service offerings have led to increased customer usage of wireless services, which, in turn, puts pressure on network capacity. In order to compete effectively, wireless service providers must keep pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through their networks. We believe that the deployment of our 4G LTE network will help us to keep pace with network capacity requirements and meet customer demand for higher speeds. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Pricing . Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering service plans that include unlimited voice minutes and text messages and a specific amount of data access in varying megabyte or gigabyte sizes or, in some cases, unlimited data usage. In addition, certain wireless service providers are also offering minutes-sharing plans; free mobile-to-mobile calling; offerings of larger bundles of included minutes at attractive price points with no roaming or long distance charges; calling group features that enable customers to place and receive calls from a group of U.S. phone numbers they designate (including landline numbers) without the call time counting against their minute allotment; and both prepaid and postpaid plans offering unlimited voice and data usage. We seek to compete in this area by offering our customers services and equipment that they will regard as the best available value for the price, as well as service plans that meet their wireless service needs. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Customer service . We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting both new-to-wireless customers and customers of other wireless providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. Our competitors also recognize the importance of customer service and are also focused on improving it. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Product and service development . As wireless technologies develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate, continued customer and revenue growth will be increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced data products and services. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative wireless products and services both independently and in collaboration with application service providers. We also collaborate with various device manufacturers in the development of distinctive smartphones and other wireless devices that can access the growing array of data applications and content available over the Internet. We continue to focus on increasing smartphone penetration throughout our customer base. In addition to these devices, we also continue to expand international roaming agreements and offer significant coverage outside of the United States for customers that require wireless services while abroad. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Sales and distribution . Key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We believe that attaining the optimal combination of varying distribution channels is important to achieving industry-leading profitability, as measured by operating income. We endeavor to increase sales through our company-operated stores, outside sales teams and telemarketing and web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, as well as through our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations and netbook and notebook OEMs. In addition, we sell network access to both traditional resellers, which resell network services to their end-users, and to various companies to enable wireless communications for their M2M devices or for their provision of telematics services. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Capital resources . In order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services, wireless service providers require significant capital resources. We generate significant cash flow from operations, as do some of our competitors. ##TABLE_END Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry, including the factors described above, as well as new technologies, new business models, changes in customer preferences, regulatory changes, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors.  ##TABLE_START Wireline ##TABLE_END Background The Wireline segment provides communications products and services including local exchange and long distance voice service, broadband video and data, IP network services, network access and other services to consumers, small businesses and carriers in the United States, as well as to businesses and government customers both in the United States and in over 150 other countries around the world. In 2012, Wireline revenues were $39.8 billion, representing approximately 34% of Verizons aggregate revenues. Wireline Service and Product Offerings We organize our service and product offerings by the primary market targeted by these offerings  mass markets, global enterprise, global wholesale and other. During 2012, Verizon acquired HUGHES Telematics, Inc. (HUGHES Telematics). The acquisition has accelerated our ability to bring more telematics offerings to market for existing and new HUGHES Telematics and Verizon customers. During 2011, we enhanced our offerings of cloud services by acquiring Terremark Worldwide Inc. (Terremark), a global provider of information technology infrastructure and cloud services, and by acquiring a provider of cloud software technology. These acquisitions improved Verizons competitive position in the managed hosting and cloud services space, enhanced our offerings to business and government customers globally and contributed to our growth in revenues. Mass Markets Mass Markets operations provide local exchange (basic service and end-user access) and long distance (including regional toll) voice services, broadband services (including high-speed Internet, FiOS Internet and FiOS Video services) to residential and small business subscribers. In 2012, Mass Markets revenues were $16.7 billion, representing approximately 42% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. Video Services. We offer video service over our fiber-optic network. As of December 31, 2012, FiOS Video is available to approximately 14.2 million homes across 12 states, as well as the District of Columbia. We believe FiOS Video has features that differentiate it from the competition, including its channel line-up, Interactive Media Guide, Home Media DVR and breadth of high definition content, as well as the following: ##TABLE_START    Flex View  With Flex View, FiOS customers can watch content anytime, anywhere, on any device. Customers who subscribe to FiOS Video and Internet also have the ability to upload their photos, music and videos to their personal Flex View Library, which gives them easy access to this content via any data-capable device. Our HBO GO offering provides customers with unlimited access to HBO programming on any data-capable device.

In addition, through FiOS TV Widgets, viewers have one-touch, on demand access to local weather, traffic and community information and popular social media applications, such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, as well as online commerce opportunities. The widget platform has evolved in an open-development environment, which provides opportunities for third parties to develop enhanced customer features via the FiOS Video product. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Customer Premise Equipment interoperability  We continue to partner with major corporations such as Microsoft and Apple to offer further interoperability with various products such as the Xbox, smart televisions and iPads. This technology further expands our initiative to provide customers with the ability to watch content anytime, anywhere, on any data-capable device. ##TABLE_END In February 2012, Verizon entered into a venture with Redbox Automated Retail, LLC (Redbox), a subsidiary of Coinstar, Inc., to offer customers nationwide access to media rentals through online and mobile content streaming as well as physical media rentals through Redbox kiosks. Verizon holds a 65% majority ownership share in the venture and Redbox holds a 35% ownership share. The venture is consolidated by Verizon for reporting purposes. In December 2012, the venture introduced its product portfolio, which includes subscription services, under the name Redbox Instant by Verizon. The initial funding related to the formation of the venture is not significant to Verizon. Data services. We offer high-speed Internet and FiOS broadband data products with varying downstream and upstream processing speeds, including FiOS Quantum. As consumers power multiple devices and stream more movies and video services, the need for faster broadband is evident. With FiOS Quantum, customers can achieve download speeds up to 300 megabytes per second (Mbps) and upload speeds up to 65 Mbps. Voice services. We offer voice services that include local exchange, regional, long distance, wire maintenance and voice messaging services, as well as VoIP services, which use the Internet or private broadband networks to transmit voice communications. We also offer plans that include landline and wireless services with calling features and unlimited calling between a Verizon customers home phone and wireless handset, all on a single bill.  Global Enterprise Global Enterprise offers Strategic services, including networking products and solutions, advanced communications services, and other core communications services to medium and large business customers, including multinational corporations, as well as state and federal government customers.

Core services include core voice and data services, which consist of a comprehensive portfolio of global solutions utilizing traditional telecommunications technology, such as conferencing and contact center solutions, and private line and data access networks. Core services also include providing customer premise equipment, installation, maintenance and site services. We are continuing to transition customers out of historical core services such as Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services. Global Wholesale Global Wholesale provides communications services including data, voice, local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local, long distance and other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers. In 2012, Global Wholesale revenues were $7.2 billion, representing approximately 18% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. A portion of Global Wholesale revenues is generated by a few large telecommunication companies, most of which compete directly with us.  Global Wholesale provides the following services, which it jointly markets with Verizons other business units through Verizon Enterprise Solutions: ##TABLE_START    Data services. We offer a robust portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance our wholesale customers networks and provide connections to their end users and subscribers. Our data services include high-speed digital data offerings, such as Ethernet and Synchronous Optical Network, as well as core data circuits, such as DS1s and DS3s. In addition, data services include special access revenues that are generated from carriers that buy dedicated local exchange capacity to support their private networks. ##TABLE_END New Ethernet connectivity in the United States represents the largest data growth opportunity in wholesale, as we pursue our technology upgrade initiative and customers look to the future and higher capacity demands. These customers are also migrating networks from time division multiplexing (TDM) to Ethernet, which will better scale and service the growth of broadband services driven by smartphones, mobile broadband and mobile video. Global Wholesale offers a complete suite of services to support the expansion of 3G networks and 4G networks. Data services also includes certain value-added business services, which leverage many of the same offerings available in the Global Enterprise portfolio, including: ##TABLE_START     Managed services  Offers wholesale customers the opportunity to outsource the management of their networks, security, remote access, and web applications to Verizon; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START     Mobility  Enables wholesale customers to enhance their portfolio to triple-play or quad-play capability by leveraging wireless devices and services offered through Verizon Wireless and packaged and resold under their own carrier brand; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START     Security  Provides wholesale customers integrated solutions to help their enterprise end-users secure their networks and data. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Voice services . We provide switched access services that allow carriers to complete their end-user calls that originate or terminate within our territory. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Local services. We offer an array of local dial tone and broadband services to competitive local exchange carriers, some of which are offered to comply with telecommunications regulations. In addition, we offer services such as collocation, resale and unbundled network elements in compliance with applicable regulations. ##TABLE_END Other Other services include such services as local exchange and long distance services derived from former MCI mass market customers and operator services. In 2012, Other revenues were $0.5 billion, representing approximately 1% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. Network To provide services to our customers, we operate an advanced telecommunications network in the United States and around the world. FiOS. Our goal is to be the premier broadband and entertainment service provider in our service areas, and we believe network reliability and expanded functionality are key to achieving this goal. As of December 31, 2012, the FiOS network passed over 17.6 million premises. Verizon has extended FiOS to the business market, as Ethernet services have seen significant growth across all lines of business. We leverage our fiber-to-the-premise infrastructure to offer new services to the business community, expanding our coverage and Ethernet and IP WAN services sought by businesses today. We offer Internet speeds up to 300 Mbps utilizing Fiber-to-the-Premise (FTTP) access technologies over fiber optic cables. Our network architecture also provides the flexibility to adapt our facilities more easily to future product development. For example, new optical terminals can be added to the FTTP network providing greater bandwidth and new services without any additional field construction. Field trials have successfully achieved connection speeds of nearly one gigabit per second (Gbps) downstream and upstream, and when a more advanced XG-PON2 technology was connected to the fiber-optic network, connection speeds of 10 Gbps were reached, demonstrating the significant capacity built into the FiOS network. Global IP . Verizons global network encompasses over 830,000 route miles of terrestrial and undersea cable. We have expanded our Virtual Private LAN service to Europe, Asia-Pacific and additional North American locations. This long haul fiber network serves the business community to support and enable far reaching international operations. We have focused on the expansion of our private IP network to serve all key international markets with Quality of Service-aware IP Virtual Private Network managed services. Our Public IP network is now interconnected to our private IP network through Security Gateway platforms that allow business customers to extend the reach of their private virtual networks to off-net sites, such as employees homes, small branch offices and mobile work forces. We have installed additional private IP edge routers for a total of 1,145 edge routers in 257 sites throughout 66 countries. Global IP traffic increased in recent years. Verizons key build-out efforts in 2012 included network expansion initiatives into Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America, as well as continued deployment of the industrys first commercial 100G (gigabits per second) technology on U.S. and European backbone routes. More than 12,000 100G Ultra-Long-Haul route miles were added to the global IP backbone in 2012. We expect to further extend our 100G technology in 2013, from our long haul backbone into our metro networks. This expansion will enable us to meet growing demand with higher access speeds, and fully support increases in the use of cloud applications, video distribution services and wireless technologies in the enterprise market.  Fiber-to-the-Cellsite. Our FTTCS Ethernet backhaul initiative is critical to supporting the substantial growth requirements of expanding 3G and 4G LTE wireless data networks nationwide. To support this initiative, over 21,000 total cell site connections have been completed since the start of this program. In conjunction with the evolution of our access plant, we are also transitioning our metro (local) network infrastructure from traditional TDM/SONET (Synchronous Optical Network)/ATM technologies to Ethernet over Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM). This new optical transport network provides features optimized for video distribution services and high-speed data services, while maintaining the level of network reliability achieved with SONET. To leverage this new network infrastructure and allow for the more efficient sharing of our network across services, we are upgrading our multiplexing and routing infrastructure to use IP, Ethernet and MPLS technologies. In addition, we are migrating from traditional TDM-based voice switching to VoIP. This migration lowers the cost of current data and voice services and creates a network that can offer future multi-media communications services by adding service platforms without requiring widespread network upgrades. We have been focused on growing our Ethernet infrastructure to support the full range of Ethernet private line and E-LAN services locally, domestically and globally. To lower the access cost and provide significant service flexibility, we are using a converged packet access strategy that replaces the private circuit-based customer access and aggregates traffic from multiple customers onto a shared Ethernet and MPLS network. We also continue to focus on emerging optical transport technologies to lower overall cost as we integrate Ethernet, SONET and Optics and ultra-long-haul technologies. Competition The wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify further with traditional, non-traditional and emerging players seeking increased market share. Current and potential competitors include cable companies, wireless service providers, other domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, Internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. In addition, companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and, to a lesser extent, global wholesale markets. We compete with these full or near-full service providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have a strong market presence, brand recognition, and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition and which may affect our future revenue growth. We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry: ##TABLE_START   Customer service : Customers expect industry-leading service from their service providers. As technologies and services evolve, the ability of a carrier to excel in this area is very important for customer acquisition and retention. In Mass Markets, we compete in this area through our service representatives and online support. In Global Enterprise, we provide our customers with ready access to their system and performance information and we conduct proactive testing of our network to identify minor issues before they affect customers. In the wholesale business, we believe service improvement can be achieved through continued system automation initiatives. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Network reliability and bandwidth (speed): As both consumers and small business customers look to leverage high-speed connections for entertainment, communications and productivity, we expect broadband penetration will continue to increase over the next several years. As online and online-enabled activities increase, so will bandwidth requirements, both downstream and upstream. To succeed, we and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can deliver against these increasing bandwidth requirements. We continue to invest in our network to be able to meet this future demand. In addition, network reliability and security are increasingly important competitive factors in the global enterprise market. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Pricing : Cable, telecommunications companies and integrated service providers use pricing to capture market share from incumbents. Pricing is also a significant factor as non-traditional modes of providing communication services emerge and new entrants compete for customers. For example, VoIP and portal-based calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Product differentiation: As a result of pricing pressures, providers need to differentiate their products and services. Customers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband and video connections. Converged features, such as integrated wireless and wireline functionality, are becoming similarly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement. ##TABLE_END In the Mass Markets business, cable operators are significant competitors. Cable operators have increased the size and digital capacity of their networks so that they can offer digital products and services. We continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include high-speed Internet access, digital television and voice services. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. In addition, wireless substitution is an ongoing competitive trend, which we expect to continue as wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable companies and other providers of VoIP services as well as Internet portal providers. As a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which requires us to allow potential competitors to purchase our services for resale or access components of our network on an unbundled basis at a prescribed cost, competition in our local exchange markets continues. Our telephone  operations generally have been required to sell their services to competitive local exchange carriers at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers. The scope of these obligations going forward and the rates we receive are subject to ongoing review and revision by the FCC and state regulators. (See Regulatory and Competitive Trends in the 2012 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners.) In the global enterprise market, the customers need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is driving the expansion of the competitive landscape. Major competitors include system integrators, carriers and hardware and software providers. Some of the biggest companies in IT services are either making acquisitions or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending. Most new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing, software delivery, communication applications and other computing tasks via the network, rather than on in-house machines. Carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major IT outsourcers. Global Wholesale competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity.  ##TABLE_START Patents, Trademarks and Licenses ##TABLE_END Verizon owns or has licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad. Verizon also actively grants licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable such companies to utilize certain Verizon intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable such third party licensees to take advantage of the results of Verizons research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to Verizon, we do not believe that loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations. Verizon periodically receives offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, or cease offering the relevant products or services. ##TABLE_START Acquisitions and Divestitures ##TABLE_END Acquisitions and Divestitures on page 44 of the 2012 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners is incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_START Regulatory and Competitive Trends ##TABLE_END Regulatory and Competitive Trends included in Other Factors That May Affect Future Results on pages 45 through 47 of the 2012 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners is incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_START Environmental Matters ##TABLE_END Environmental Matters included in Other Factors That May Affect Future Results on page 47 of the 2012 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners is incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_START Executive Officers ##TABLE_END See Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our executive officers. ##TABLE_START Employees ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2012, Verizon and its subsidiaries had approximately 183,400 employees. Unions represent approximately 29% of our employees. During 2012, we reached agreements with the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers on new, three-year contracts that cover approximately 43,000 Wireline employees. These new agreements will expire on August 1, 2015. ##TABLE_START Information on Our Internet Website ##TABLE_END We make available, free of charge on our website, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports at www.verizon.com/investor.

Risk Factors ##TABLE_END The following discussion of Risk Factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition or future performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations. Unfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or in one or more of our other major markets, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. Similarly, under these conditions the business customers that we serve in the United States and abroad may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We face significant competition that may reduce our market share and lower our profits. We face significant competition in our industry. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated the traditional distinctions between wireless, cable, Internet, local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, application and device providers, electric utilities, and providers of VoIP services. While these changes have enabled us to offer new types of services, they have also allowed other service providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our services and equipment, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to successfully respond to these competitive challenges, we could lose market share and experience reduced profits. If we are not able to adapt to changes in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits. Our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints to our introduction of new services. If our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. In addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as switch and network equipment, handsets and other devices and equipment, that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. For example, our handset and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices. If these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers. We also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. Because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry. We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology. Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict our ability to operate in or provide specified products or services in designated areas and require that we maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are frequently involved in regulatory and non-regulatory governmental proceedings related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Unless we are able to obtain appropriate relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years that are subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our wireless business, results of operations and financial condition. The adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal or state level could also adversely affect our business plans. New regulations could restrict the ways in which we can manage our wireline and wireless networks, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. For example, the development of new technologies, such as IP-based services, including VoIP and super high-speed broadband and video, could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology. As the holder of 700 MHz C Block licenses, we are required to comply with certain open access regulations that the FCC has imposed on all licensees of 700 MHz C Block spectrum. These rules require us to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice on the LTE network we are deploying on that spectrum, including those obtained from sources other than us or our distributors or dealers, subject to certain technical limitations established by us. In addition, our broadband Internet access services are subject to certain FCC-imposed net neutrality rules, which took effect in November 2011 and are subject to a pending appeal. These rules limit the ways that a broadband Internet access service provider can manage its network and the services it can provide over the network. Given that the scope of the restrictions and many critical terms in the open access and net neutrality rules are not fully defined and given that the rules create procedural mechanisms for parties to complain of violations, it is reasonable to expect litigation to resolve ambiguities, which could lead to yet further regulation. The regulation of broadband activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our broadband networks. Cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology (IT) security may cause equipment failures or disruptions to our operations. Our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share to other communications providers. In addition, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Cyber attacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses and other means for disruption or unauthorized access, on companies, including Verizon, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks or other cyber incidents which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology and networks may be insufficient to repel a major cyber attack in the future. The costs associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cyber security measures, lost revenues from business interruption, litigation and damage to our reputation. Further, certain of Verizons businesses, including the provisioning of security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. In addition, if we fail to prevent the theft of valuable information such as financial data, sensitive information about the Company and intellectual property, or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against breaches of network or IT security, it could result in damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence. Any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. A natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. In addition, these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation. Adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could affect our access to financing. Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. With approximately 183,400 employees and approximately 205,600 retirees as of December 31, 2012 participating in Verizons benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors including the continuing implementation of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 29% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. We are currently engaged in contract negotiations with labor unions representing approximately 4,800 Wireline employees, and we will engage in additional negotiations as other labor contracts expire in the future. Depending on the outcome of these negotiations, we could incur additional costs and/or experience lengthy work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations, including causing a loss of revenue and strained relationships with customers. We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. Our business faces a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements.  ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Land, buildings and building equipment consists of land and land improvements, central office buildings or any other buildings that house network equipment, and buildings that are used for administrative and other purposes. Substantially all the switching centers are located on land and in buildings we own due to their critical role in the network and high set-up relocation costs. We also maintain facilities throughout the United States comprised of administrative and sales offices, customer care centers, retail sales locations, switching centers, cell sites and data centers. Furniture and other consists of telephone equipment, furniture, data processing equipment, office equipment, motor vehicles, plant under construction, capitalized non-network computer software costs and leasehold improvements. A portion of our property is subject to the liens of their respective mortgages securing funded debt.  ##TABLE_START ", "3": " Item 3. Legal Proceedings ##TABLE_END On September 15, 2010, the U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bank), as Litigation Trustee for the Idearc Inc. Litigation Trust (Litigation Trust), filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against Verizon and certain subsidiaries challenging the November 2006 spin-off of Verizons former directories business then known as Idearc Inc. U.S. Bank, which represents a group of creditors who filed claims in the Idearc Inc. bankruptcy proceedings, alleges that Idearc Inc. was insolvent at the time of the spin-off or became insolvent shortly thereafter. The Litigation Trust seeks over $9 billion in damages. Following a two-week trial in October 2012 limited to the question of the value of Idearc Inc. on the date of the spin-off, on January 22, 2013, the Court issued a decision finding that the value was at least $12 billion. As $12 billion exceeds the value of the debt and cash that Idearc transferred to Verizon on the date of the spin-off, the Court issued a related Order to Show Cause directing the Litigation Trust to submit a brief that explains why any (or all) of its legal claims are viable in light of the courts finding on Idearcs value. Briefing of that issue is scheduled to be completed by March 15, 2013. On October 25, 2011, a Litigation Trust created during the bankruptcy proceedings of FairPoint Communications, Inc. filed a complaint in state court in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, against Verizon and other related entities, including Verizon Wireless. The complaint claims that FairPoints acquisition of Verizons landline operations in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont in March 2008 was structured and carried out in a way that left FairPoint insolvent or led to its insolvency shortly thereafter and ultimately to its October 2009 bankruptcy. The Litigation Trust seeks approximately $2 billion in damages. Verizon removed the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina in November 2011. In June 2012, the Litigation Trust filed a Second Amended Complaint that dropped all claims against Verizon Wireless. Verizon filed a motion to dismiss the majority of claims in the Second Amended Complaint and a decision is pending. Discovery in the case is ongoing, with a trial set for May 2013. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures ##TABLE_END None.  ##TABLE_START PART II ", "5": " Item 5.

The Board also determined that no additional shares were to be purchased under the previously authorized buyback program. The program permits Verizon to repurchase shares over time, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs. The Company may also enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans from time to time to facilitate repurchases of its shares under this authorization. A Rule 10b5-1 plan permits the Company to repurchase shares at times when it might otherwise be prevented from doing so, provided the plan is adopted when the Company is not aware of material non-public information. During the fourth quarter of 2012, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon common stock. At December 31, 2012, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 100 million. Through February 15, 2013, we purchased approximately 3.50 million shares under this authorization.

Business ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START General ##TABLE_END Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon, or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the worlds leading providers of communications, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies with a presence in over 150 countries around the world. Formerly known as Bell Atlantic Corporation, we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We began doing business as Verizon on June 30, 2000 following our merger with GTE Corporation. We have a highly diverse workforce of approximately 176,800 employees. Our principal executive offices are located at 140 West Street, New York, New York 10007 (telephone number 212-395-1000). We have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business segments and organize by products and services. ##TABLE_START Wireless  Wireless communications products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided to consumer, business and government customers across the United States. Wireline  Wirelines voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services include broadband video and data, corporate networking solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and in over 150 other countries around the world. ##TABLE_END The following portions of the 2013 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners are incorporated into this report: ##TABLE_START    Overview on pages 10 through 12; and, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Segment Results of Operations on pages 17 through 22 and in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 65 through 67. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Wireless ##TABLE_END Background Our Wireless segment is primarily comprised of Cellco Partnership doing business as Verizon Wireless. Cellco Partnership is a joint venture formed in April 2000 by the combination of the U.S. wireless operations and interests of Verizon and Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone). As of December 31, 2013, Verizon owned a controlling 55% interest in Verizon Wireless and Vodafone owned the remaining 45%. Verizon Wireless provides wireless communication services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States and has the largest fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology and third-generation (3G) Evolution - Data Optimized (EV-DO) networks of any U.S. wireless service provider. On September 2, 2013, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement with Vodafone and Vodafone 4 Limited, pursuant to which Verizon agreed to acquire Vodafones indirect 45% interest in Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless for aggregate consideration of approximately $130 billion (the Wireless Transaction). We completed the transaction on February 21, 2014 and acquired 100% ownership of Verizon Wireless. The consideration paid was primarily comprised of cash and Verizon common stock. Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless service provider in the United States as measured by retail connections and revenue. At December 31, 2013, Verizon Wireless had 102.8 million retail connections and 2013 revenues of approximately $81.0 billion, representing approximately 67% of Verizons aggregate revenues. We have substantially completed the deployment of our 4G LTE network. Our 4G LTE network is available to 97% of the U.S. population in more than 500 markets covering approximately 305 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. Under this program, we are working with wireless carriers in rural areas to collaboratively build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carriers network assets and our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 MHz C-Block spectrum. Our 4G LTE network provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that provided via 3G networks.  Wireless Service and Product Offerings Our wireless services are available to our customers receiving service under the Verizon Wireless brand. In addition, customers can obtain wireless products and services that operate on our network from resellers that purchase network access from us on a wholesale basis. Wireless Services We offer our wireless services on a postpaid and prepaid basis. Retail (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts represent retail customers under contract with Verizon Wireless that are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and use its branded services. Our postpaid account plans include More Everything  plans, single connection plans, plans tailored to the needs of our corporate customers, as well as legacy single connection plans and family plans that we no longer offer to new accounts. A single account may receive monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. Postpaid connections represent individual lines of service for which a customer is billed in advance a monthly access charge in return for a monthly network service allowance (access service revenues), and usage beyond the allowance is billed in arrears (usage service revenues). Approximately 94% of our retail connections received our wireless services on a postpaid basis as of December 31, 2013. Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless services without a long-term contract or credit verification by paying for all services in advance. Our wireless plans offer various packages of services that allow customers, regardless of the device, to select the plan that best matches their network usage patterns. On February 13, 2014, we introduced our More Everything plans which replaced our Share Everything  plans and provide more value to our customers. These plans, which are available to both new and existing postpaid customers, feature domestic unlimited voice minutes, unlimited domestic and international text, video and picture messaging, cloud storage and a single data allowance that can be shared among up to 10 devices connected to the Verizon Wireless network. Customers with Verizon Edge, which provides a device payment plan option, also will receive discounted monthly access fees on More Everything plans. For an additional monthly access fee, our customers have the option of sharing long distance and roaming minutes among their devices for calls from the United States to, and calls while within, Canada and Mexico. The More Everything plans also include the Mobile Hotspot service on our smartphones at no additional charge. The Mobile Hotspot service allows a customer to use our network to create a Wi-Fi network that can be used by Wi-Fi enabled devices. Verizon Wireless also offers shared data plans for business, with the More Everything plans for Small Business and the Nationwide Business Data Packages and Plans. As of December 31, 2013, Share Everything accounts represented approximately 46% of our retail postpaid accounts, compared to approximately 23% as of December 31, 2012. We offer a wide variety of wireless services, including Internet access, via our broad range of devices. Our customers can access the Internet on all of our smartphones, as well as our basic phones that include HTML web-browsing capability. We also offer service that enables our customers to access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets that either have embedded 4G LTE or 3G EV-DO modules, or that are used in conjunction with separate devices that enable access to this service, such as smartphones and USB modems as well as Jetpacks TM and other dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection. These devices can be added to the customers More Everything plan for an additional monthly fee, or the customer can obtain a separate plan for the device at various price points, depending upon both the size of the data allowance purchased and the device covered by the plan. In addition, we offer messaging services, which enable our customers to send and receive text, picture and video messages. Our customers can access multimedia offerings, mostly provided by third parties, consisting of applications providing music, video, gaming, news and other content, while our business-focused offerings, which are designed to increase productivity, include solutions that enable customers to access the Internet and their corporate intranets, as well as products that enable wireless e-mail across our diverse portfolio of wireless devices. Our location-based services provide our customers with directions to their destination and enable our business customers to locate, monitor and communicate with their mobile field workers. Our global data services allow our customers to access data services on our Global Ready Phones from hundreds of international destinations and to access the Internet at such destinations with laptops that are either Global Ready, tethered to a Global Ready Phone, or are used in conjunction with other Global Ready devices, such as certain USB modems or Jetpacks. In addition, our customers have access to more than one million applications and services developed and distributed by third parties, such as those offered via Google Play, accessible on our smartphones running on the Google, Inc. (Google) Android operating system, those offered via the Apple, Inc. (Apple) iTunes store, accessible through smartphones and tablets running on the Apple iOS operating system, those offered by Microsoft Inc. (Microsoft), via Microsofts Windows Phone OS operating system and those offered by BlackBerry Limited (BlackBerry), through its BlackBerry App World webstore. Our customers can make and receive calls on their home phone handsets using our wireless network through our Home Phone Connect service or Verizon 4G LTE Broadband Router with Voice service. We also offer HomeFusion  Broadband, a high-speed Internet service that provides customers with Internet connections in their homes using our 4G LTE network. In addition, we provide network access and, in some cases, enhanced value added services to support telemetry-type applications, which are characterized by machine-to-machine (M2M) wireless connections. Our M2M services support devices that are used by a variety of vertical market segments, including healthcare, education, manufacturing, utilities, distribution and consumer products. For example, companies purchase network access and, in some cases, enhanced services from us in order to connect with and monitor equipment, such as medical devices used to monitor patients, fleet management devices used to monitor company-operated vehicles and utility monitoring devices used for smart grid applications. Other companies purchase network access and, in some cases, enhanced services from us to support devices that are included in a service they, in turn, sell to end users. We also support telematics services for some of the largest automotive manufacturers. We expect that consumer use of M2M wireless connections, such as home monitoring, health monitoring, energy management and utilities management will increase as consumers integrate these devices into their mobile lifestyle.  Wireless Devices We offer several categories of wireless devices, including smartphones, tablets and other Internet access devices as well as basic phones. Smartphones . Our device line-up includes an array of smartphones that are enabled to utilize our 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO high-speed data services and run on various operating platforms, such as Apple iOS, Google Android, BlackBerry OS, and Windows Phone OS. In August 2013, we launched the new Verizon Edge device payment plan option which now allows customers to trade in their phone for a new phone after a minimum of thirty days, subject to certain conditions. Tablets and Other Internet Devices. We offer a variety of 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO-enabled tablets from multiple manufacturers that run primarily on either the Apple iOS, Google Android or Microsoft Windows operating system. In 2013, we launched the Ellipsis 7 tablet, which is available exclusively from Verizon Wireless. The tablets we offer also permit our customers to access the Internet via a Wi-Fi connection. In addition, we offer dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO connection, which we refer to as Jetpacks, capable of connecting multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices to the Internet at one time. Our customers can also access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on their computers via data cards, USB modems or through the use of certain laptop computers and netbooks with embedded 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO Mobile Broadband modules offered by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). During 2013, we continued to experience strong subscriber demand for tablets and other Internet devices, and the percentage of our retail postpaid connection base represented by connections to these devices continued to increase. Basic Phones . Most of the basic phones we offer are 3G EV-DO-enabled and have HTML-browsing capability. We purchase wireless devices and accessories from a number of manufacturers, with the substantial majority of our purchases made from Apple, Motorola Mobility, Samsung, LG Electronics, BlackBerry, HTC, Hitachi and Quality One Wireless (through which we purchase Pantech devices and accessories). A key component of all wireless devices is the chipset, which contains the intelligence of the device. The LTE chipsets used in our 4G LTE-enabled devices are manufactured by various companies, each using its own 4G LTE chipset technology. For the manufacture and supply of our CDMA-1XRTT and EV-DO chipsets, most of our wireless device suppliers rely on Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm). We also sell phones that include CDMA-1XRTT and EV-DO chipsets manufactured by VIA Telecom under license from Qualcomm. In addition, there are a number of other components common to wireless phones provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly. Strategic Initiatives We have undertaken several initiatives to develop innovative devices, data services and applications available to run on our networks, including the following: ##TABLE_START   Mobile Video. Video content is projected to account for a majority of mobile network traffic by 2018. We believe the growth in video consumption using mobile devices provides us with an opportunity for revenue growth. We have made investments in converging technologies and services involving content delivery networks, video streaming and related consumer hardware to leverage new content models. Our 4G LTE network enables us to move towards a unified video strategy that positions us to take advantage of this growth opportunity. For example, we are using Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service technology to develop our LTE Multicast service. This service has the potential to enhance our network efficiency and provide our customers with access to live streaming video content with virtually no buffering, regardless of the number of devices using the service. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Mobile Commerce. Every day, large volumes of transactions are carried across our network. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to influence and benefit from the rapid growth of the mobile commerce market that is being driven by technology advances such as the proliferations of smartphones and tablets. Isis, a mobile commerce platform, represents the first phase of our initiatives to address this opportunity. Launched in November 2013 as a joint venture with ATT Inc. (ATT) and T-Mobile USA, Inc. (T-Mobile USA), Isis enables customers to pay for point-of-sale purchases via their mobile phones using near field communications technology rather than paying with cash or a credit card. Known as the ISIS Mobile Wallet, this service enables customers to organize all of their payment cards, offers and loyalty cards in one convenient application on their Isis-ready phone. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Innovation centers. We operate innovation centers in Waltham, Massachusetts and San Francisco. We believe our centers serve as catalysts for the development of non-traditional devices, services and applications that take full advantage of our 4G LTE network. The centers work with many of our strategic partners representing various industries to help them quickly bring products, services, applications and solutions to market. ##TABLE_END Network We have the largest 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO networks of any service provider in the United States, with licensed and operational coverage in all of the 100 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas. As of January 21, 2014, our 4G LTE network covers approximately 305 million people in the U.S., including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America program. We strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for their wireless services. We design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions and completions of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds, and that maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped. We plan to continue to expand and upgrade our network, primarily to increase capacity, as well as explore strategic opportunities to expand our national network coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses.  In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the United States where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the United States. Certain of our roaming agreements are terminable at will by either party upon several months notice; however, we do not believe that the termination of any of these at-will agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business. Technology Our primary network technology platforms are 4G LTE and 3G Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). 4G LTE provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to those offered by 3G technologies. We continue working to expand 4G LTE coverage beyond our network footprint through our LTE in Rural America Program. We currently have 20 committed program participants that have the potential to provide 4G LTE coverage to approximately three million people under the program and, to date, sixteen participants have commenced operations on such networks. In 2012, we began testing our mobile Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) network known as Voice over LTE (VoLTE). This technology, which is expected to be used in addition to the current voice technology, is anticipated to launch commercially in 2014. Our 3G CDMA network is based on spread-spectrum digital radio technology. CDMA-1XRTT technology is deployed in nearly all of the cell sites in our 3G CDMA network. In addition, EV-DO, a 3G packet-based technology intended primarily for high-speed data transmission, is deployed in substantially all of the cell sites in our 3G CDMA network. Our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service. Power and backhaul transport facilities can often become a networks vulnerability. Consequently, we have battery backup at every switch and every cell site in our network. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our cell sites and at every switch location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed to cell sites if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant backbone Multiprotocol Label Switching network in all critical locations. Spectrum The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services. We have licenses to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 MHz band, also known as cellular spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum, and the 1700 and 2100 MHz band, also known as Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum, in areas that, collectively, cover nearly all of the population of the United States. In addition, we hold licenses for portions of the 700 MHz upper C band, including ten licenses that can, together, be used to provide wireless service coverage to the entire United States and the Gulf of Mexico. Since 2012, we have entered into several spectrum transactions including: ##TABLE_START   In 2012, Verizon Wireless acquired AWS spectrum in separate transactions with SpectrumCo, LLC and Cox TMI Wireless, LLC for which it paid an aggregate of $3.9 billion at the time of the closings. During 2012, Verizon Wireless also completed license purchase and exchange transactions with Leap Wireless, Savary Island Wireless, which is majority owned by Leap Wireless, and a subsidiary of T-Mobile USA. As a result of these transactions, Verizon Wireless received an aggregate $2.6 billion of AWS and PCS licenses at fair value and transferred certain AWS licenses to T-Mobile USA and a 700 megahertz (MHz) lower A block license to Leap Wireless. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   During the first quarter of 2013, we completed license exchange transactions with T-Mobile License LLC and Cricket License Company, LLC, a subsidiary of Leap Wireless, to exchange certain AWS licenses. These non-cash exchanges include a number of intra-market swaps that we expect will enable Verizon Wireless to make more efficient use of the AWS band. As a result of these exchanges, we received an aggregate $0.5 billion of AWS licenses at fair value. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   During the third quarter of 2013, after receiving the required regulatory approvals, Verizon Wireless sold 39 lower 700 MHz B block spectrum licenses to ATT in exchange for a payment of $1.9 billion and the transfer by ATT to Verizon Wireless of AWS (10 MHz) licenses in certain markets in the western United States. Verizon Wireless also sold certain lower 700 MHz B block spectrum licenses to an investment firm for a payment of $0.2 billion. As a result, we received $0.5 billion of AWS licenses at fair value. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   During the fourth quarter of 2013, we entered into license exchange agreements with T-Mobile USA to exchange certain AWS and PCS licenses. These non-cash exchanges, which are subject to approval by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other customary closing conditions, are expected to close in the first half of 2014. The exchange includes a number of swaps that we expect will result in more efficient use of the AWS and PCS bands. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START   Subsequent to the transaction with T-Mobile USA in the fourth quarter of 2013, on January 6, 2014, we announced two agreements with T-Mobile USA with respect to our remaining 700 MHz A block spectrum licenses. Under one agreement, we will sell certain of these licenses to T-Mobile USA in exchange for cash consideration of approximately $2.4 billion, and under the second agreement we will exchange the remainder of these licenses for AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. These transactions are subject to the approval of the FCC as well as other customary closing conditions. These transactions are expected to close in the middle of 2014. ##TABLE_END We anticipate we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. This increasing demand is being driven by growth in customer connections and usage of wireless broadband services, which use more bandwidth and require ever faster rates of speed to stay competitive. We can meet spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when offered by the FCC in future spectrum auctions. Although the availability of new spectrum for commercial wireless services and the possible dates of future FCC spectrum auctions are uncertain at this time, the FCC and the current Presidential Administration have been seeking the release of additional mobile use spectrum. The FCC is expected to conduct an auction for AWS-3 spectrum in late 2014. In addition, Congress has adopted legislation that provides for the establishment of a national public safety network and the reallocation and auction, through the use of voluntary incentive auctions, by 2022 of portions of the existing broadcast spectrum. The incentive auction related to the 600 MHz band is expected to take place in mid-2015 although the specific timing of the AWS-3, 600 MHz and other auctions will be determined by future regulatory proceedings. Since we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and may have spectrum surpluses in others, we have at times exchanged spectrum licenses with other service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future. In other cases, Verizon Wireless has entered into intra-market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency. These swaps as well as any spectrum purchases are subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses in each instance. Network Equipment and Build-out Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our LTE network deployments for macro sites as well as small cells. Our primary CDMA cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are Alcatel-Lucent, which provides more than half of our CDMA cell site equipment, and Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN) and Ericsson, which together provide nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment. We also rely on Alcatel-Lucent, NSN and Ericsson for our switching equipment. As we continue to build and upgrade our existing network, we must complete a variety of steps, including securing rights to a large number of sites and obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals for macro sites, small cells, in-building systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We utilize tower site management firms, such as Crown Castle International Corp. and American Tower Corporation, as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing tower sites upon which our operations depend. Marketing and Distribution Our marketing strategy is focused on offering solutions tailored to the needs of our various customer market groups; promoting our brand; leveraging our extensive distribution network; and jointly marketing our products and services to large business and government customers with Verizons Wireline business units through Verizon Enterprise Solutions, a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of Verizons solutions for medium and large business and government customers globally. Our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television, print, radio, outdoor signage, Internet and point-of-sale media promotions designed to present our corporate message consistently across all of our markets. We use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs. Company-operated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy. Our direct channel, which includes our business-to-business sales operations and systems organization, is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of consumers and local, regional and national business customers. In addition, we have a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers, and we offer fully-automated, end-to-end web-based sales of wireless devices, accessories and service plans. In November 2013, we launched our first Verizon Destination store at Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. The store focuses on the mobile lifestyle and highlights the many ways consumers can use wireless technology in their daily lives. The store is part of a broader initiative that includes the redesign of our retail stores nationwide, to become smart stores. These newly redesigned locations showcase the same mobile lifestyle zones as the Verizon Destination store but on a smaller scale. During the next few years, we plan to open additional destination stores in high traffic locations across the country. In addition, our online store and Gadgets  Gear portal have also been redesigned to deliver a consistent shopping experience for customers across browsers and mobile platforms. Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the United States, as well as through the Internet. The majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services, and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us. We also utilize high-profile, national retailers, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart, RadioShack and Target, to sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services. Stores such as Dollar General and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services. We have also entered into agency agreements with a number of broadband, video and voice service providers through which our products and services are sold on a stand-alone basis or bundled with their services.  Competition We operate in a highly competitive industry. We compete against other national wireless service providers, including ATT, Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile USA, as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilities-based wireless service providers for resale, including those that buy from us. We expect competition to intensify as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels, network investment, the development and deployment of new technologies, the introduction of new products and services, new market entrants, the availability of additional spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, and regulatory changes. Competition may also increase as smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service providers. The wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services. For example, Microsoft, Google, Apple and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless providers voice service. We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry: ##TABLE_START   Network reliability, capacity and coverage. We believe that a wireless network that consistently provides high quality and reliable service is a key differentiator in the U.S. market and a driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new wireless service offerings, which in many cases include video content, have led to increased customer usage of wireless services, which, in turn, puts pressure on network capacity. In order to compete effectively, wireless service providers must keep pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through their networks. We believe that our 4G LTE network will help us to keep pace with network capacity requirements and meet customer demand for higher speeds. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Pricing. Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering service plans that include unlimited voice minutes and text messages and a specific amount of data access in varying megabyte or gigabyte sizes or, in some cases, unlimited data usage. In addition, certain wireless service providers are also offering minutes-sharing plans; larger bundles of included minutes with no roaming or long distance charges; features that enable customers to place and receive calls from a group of self-designated U.S. phone numbers (including landline numbers) at no additional charge; and both prepaid and postpaid plans offering unlimited voice and data usage. Wireless service providers are also offering price plans that decouple service pricing from equipment pricing and blur the traditional boundary between prepaid and postpaid plans. In addition, some wireless service providers are offering a credit to new customers to reimburse early termination fees paid to their former wireless service provider, subject to certain limitations. ##TABLE_END We seek to compete in this area by offering our customers price plans for our services, as well as equipment offers, that they will regard as the best available value for the price. ##TABLE_START   Customer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers, including those of other wireless providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. Our competitors also recognize the importance of customer service and are also focused on improving in this area. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Product and service development. As wireless technologies develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate, continued customer and revenue growth will be increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced data products and services. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative wireless products and services both independently and in collaboration with application service providers. We also collaborate with various device manufacturers in the development of distinctive smartphones and other wireless devices that can access the growing array of data applications and content available over the Internet. We continue to focus on increasing smartphone penetration throughout our customer base. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Sales and distribution. Key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We believe that attaining the optimal combination of varying distribution channels is important to achieving industry-leading profitability, as measured by operating income. We endeavor to increase sales through our company-operated stores, outside sales teams and telemarketing and web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, as well as through our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations and netbook and notebook OEMs. In addition, we sell network access to both traditional resellers, which resell network services to their end-users, and to various companies to enable wireless communications for their M2M devices or for their provision of telematics services. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Capital resources. In order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services, wireless service providers require significant capital resources. We generate significant cash flow from operations, as do some of our competitors. ##TABLE_END Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry, including the factors described above, as well as new technologies, new business models, changes in customer preferences, regulatory changes, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors.  ##TABLE_START Wireline ##TABLE_END Background Our Wireline segment provides voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services including broadband video and data, corporate networking solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services.

Capitalizing on market growth in cloud services and on enterprise trends toward outsourcing IT infrastructure and services, Verizon introduced an evolutionary cloud platform built for speed and performance, using our own software-based intellectual property and enterprise-grade reliability. Verizon Cloud Compute and Cloud Storage adopt a new approach to how public clouds are built, enabling customers of all sizes to take advantage of the agility and economic benefit of a generic public cloud along with the reliability and scale of an enterprise-level service, while maintaining control of performance. Virtual machines (software-based computers and servers) can be created and deployed in seconds, and users build and pay for what they need. ##TABLE_END Our cloud infrastructure also enables real-time analytical capabilities for our M2M customers, providing an end-to-end capability where customers can store, process and analyze large amounts of data on a real-time basis. Our cloud infrastructure also has the ability to handle multiple instances of an application providing global support and availability of the applications without increased latency. The integration of our cloud infrastructure with our telematics assets provides our customers with new and innovative service capabilities that are scalable, and which we believe are operationally superior to other bifurcated approaches.  ##TABLE_START   Security. With new technologies changing how enterprises do business, the cyber security landscape continues to evolve. We believe that businesses are making business and customer data protection one of their highest priorities in order to protect their brand and enhance customer loyalty. We believe that Verizon has an advantage in its ability to reduce cyber risks and mitigate the damaging impact of advanced cyber attacks due to the volume of traffic carried globally on our networks. We will continue to advance our portfolio of forensics services and managed security services, building new capabilities to identify risks and threats and expanding our IT Security professional services and outsourcing. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Verizon Telematics. Our suite of real-time vehicle communications services and applications connects automobiles with content, services and call centers. Our platform enables factory installed and aftermarket automotive safety and security as well as location-based services and vehicle diagnostics. We provide usage-based data services to new vehicles in the United States and in 2013 we extended our agreement with two auto manufacturers to provide services for new vehicles in China and in Europe. Through our In-Drive solution, we have partnered with a major automotive insurance provider to deliver usage-based insurance programs and other connected applications. Our NetworkFleet solution provides commercial fleet managers throughout North America with real-time access to data that yields operational efficiencies, increased vehicle reliability and improved driver safety.

We believe these investments will assist us in bringing innovative next-generation products and services to market and uncover new sources of revenue, increase revenue of existing projects and leverage our strengths across the company. Network To provide services to our customers, we operate an advanced telecommunications network in the United States and around the world. ##TABLE_START   FiOS. Our goal is to distinguish FiOS as a premier residential broadband service in the United States. As of December 31, 2013, our FiOS service passed over 18.5 million premises, and our latest FiOS Quantum service offerings now provide download speeds up to 500 Mbps and upload speeds up to 100 Mbps. New services such as the FiOS Mobile App are also extending our TV experience to a host of mobile devices. We expect bandwidth demands to grow with the continued emergence of new video and data applications and the proliferation of IP devices in the home. ##TABLE_END The Passive Optical Network technology upon which the FiOS network is deployed positions Verizon to meet growing bandwidth requirements. Our network architecture provides the flexibility to adapt our facilities more easily to future product development. For example, new optical terminals can be added to the fiber-to-the-premise network providing greater bandwidth and new services without any additional field construction. Select field trials have successfully achieved connection speeds of nearly one gigabit per second (Gbps), and when a more advanced next-generation technology has been connected to the fiber-optic network, connection speeds of 10 Gbps have been reached, demonstrating the significant growth capacity built into the FiOS platform. Additionally, this advanced optical network is also finding increased application opportunities in the business sector, especially as the industry seeks to migrate to Ethernet-based access services. ##TABLE_START   Global IP . Verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiber networks with long haul, metro and submarine cable assets providing connectivity to customers in over 150 countries. Verizons global network encompasses over 830,000 route miles of terrestrial and undersea cable, serving the business community to support and enable far reaching international operations. ##TABLE_END Global IP traffic has increased substantially over the last five years and is expected to continue to grow significantly. This global business is also rapidly evolving to an everything-as-a-service model in which business customers seek cloud-based, converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services. With the continued deployment of its packet optical transport strategy, Verizon is creating a single, high-capacity global network platform that combines optical transport with advanced packet switching technology. The result is a global IP network that can offer powerful solutions to these service demands. Although overall Wireline capital expenditures declined in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as a result of decreased legacy spending requirements and a decline in spending on our FiOS network, we furthered our Global IP network expansion initiatives into Europe, Asia, Africa and South America, as well as the continued deployment of the industrys first commercial 100G Gbps technology on U.S. and European backbone routes. More than 13,000 100G Ultra-Long-Haul route miles were added to the global IP network in 2013, and we plan to further extend our 100G technology in 2014. We believe that our continued focus on advancing our fiber-based networks and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology deployments will help Verizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential and enterprise customers.  Competition The wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify further with traditional, non-traditional and emerging players seeking increased market share. Current and potential competitors include cable companies, wireless service providers, other domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, Internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. In addition, companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and, to a lesser extent, global wholesale markets. We compete with these full or near-full service providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have a strong market presence, brand recognition, and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition and which may affect our future revenue growth. We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry: ##TABLE_START   Customer service : Customers expect industry-leading service from their service providers. As technologies and services evolve, the ability to excel in this area is very important for customer acquisition and retention. In Mass Markets, we compete in this area through our service representatives and online support. In Global Enterprise, we provide our customers with ready access to their system and performance information, and we conduct proactive testing of our network to identify issues before they affect customers. In the wholesale business, we believe service improvement can be achieved through continued system automation initiatives. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Network reliability and bandwidth (speed): As both consumers and small business customers look to leverage high-speed connections for entertainment, communications and productivity, we expect broadband penetration will continue to increase over the next several years. As online and online-enabled activities increase, so will bandwidth requirements, both downstream and upstream. To succeed, we and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can deliver against these increasing bandwidth requirements. We continue to invest in our network to be able to meet this future demand. In addition, network reliability and security are increasingly important competitive factors in the global enterprise market. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Pricing: Cable, telecommunications companies and integrated service providers use pricing to capture market share from incumbents. Pricing is also a significant factor as non-traditional modes of providing communication services emerge and new entrants compete for customers. For example, VoIP and portal-based calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Product differentiation: As a result of pricing pressures, providers need to differentiate their products and services. Customers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband and video connections. Converged features, such as integrated wireless and wireline functionality, are becoming similarly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement. ##TABLE_END In the Mass Markets business, cable operators are significant competitors. Cable operators have increased the size and digital capacity of their networks so that they can offer digital products and services. We continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include high-speed Internet access, digital television and voice services. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. In addition, wireless substitution is an ongoing competitive trend, which we expect to continue as wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable companies and other providers of VoIP services as well as Internet portal providers. As a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which requires us to allow potential competitors to purchase our services for resale or access components of our network on an unbundled basis at a prescribed cost, competition in our local exchange markets continues. Our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to competitive local exchange carriers at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers. The scope of these obligations going forward and the rates we receive are subject to ongoing review and revision by the FCC and state regulators. (See Regulatory and Competitive Trends in the 2013 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners.) In the global enterprise market, the customers need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is driving the expansion of the competitive landscape. Major competitors include system integrators, carriers and hardware and software providers. Some of the biggest companies in IT services are either making acquisitions or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending. Most new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing, software delivery, communication applications and other computing tasks via the network, rather than on in-house machines. Carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major IT outsourcers. Global Wholesale competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity.  ##TABLE_START Patents, Trademarks and Licenses ##TABLE_END Verizon owns or has licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad. Verizon also actively grants licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable such companies to utilize certain Verizon intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable such third party licensees to take advantage of the results of Verizons research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to Verizon, we do not believe that loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations. Verizon periodically receives offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, or cease offering the relevant products or services. ##TABLE_START Acquisitions and Divestitures ##TABLE_END Acquisitions and Divestitures on pages 32 through 33 of the 2013 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners is incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_START Regulatory and Competitive Trends ##TABLE_END Regulatory and Competitive Trends included in Other Factors That May Affect Future Results on pages 34 through 35 of the 2013 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners is incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_START Environmental Matters ##TABLE_END Environmental Matters included in Other Factors That May Affect Future Results on page 35 of the 2013 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners is incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_START Executive Officers ##TABLE_END See Part III, Item 10.

These statements are based on our estimates and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include the information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations. Forward-looking statements also include those preceded or followed by the words anticipates, believes, estimates, hopes or similar expressions. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The following important factors, along with those discussed elsewhere in this report and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), could affect future results and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements: ##TABLE_START    the ability to realize the expected benefits of the Wireless Transaction in the timeframe expected or at all; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    an adverse change in the ratings afforded our debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations or adverse conditions in the credit markets affecting the cost, including interest rates, and/or availability of further financing; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    significantly increased levels of indebtedness as a result of the Wireless Transaction; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in tax laws or treaties, or in their interpretation; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    material adverse changes in labor matters, including labor negotiations, and any resulting financial and/or operational impact; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    material changes in technology or technology substitution; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    disruption of our key suppliers provisioning of products or services; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate, including any increase in restrictions on our ability to operate our networks; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    breaches of network or information technology security, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or acts of war or significant litigation and any resulting financial impact not covered by insurance; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the effects of competition in the markets in which we operate; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in accounting assumptions that regulatory agencies, including the SEC, may require or that result from changes in the accounting rules or their application, which could result in an impact on earnings; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    significant increases in benefit plan costs or lower investment returns on plan assets; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the inability to implement our business strategies. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors ##TABLE_END The following discussion of Risk Factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition or future performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. Similarly, under these conditions, the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We face significant competition that may reduce our profits. We face significant competition in our industry. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, Internet, local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, application and device providers, electric utilities and providers of VoIP services. While these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits. If we are not able to adapt to changes in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits. Our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services. If our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. In addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services. We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as switch and network equipment and handsets, that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. For example, our handset and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices. If these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers. We also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. Because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry. We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology.  Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and to provide specified products or services. We are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. New laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. For example, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services. As another example, we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called open access FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. In addition, our broadband Internet access services are subject to various attempts to impose so-called network neutrality rules, some of which were affirmed and others vacated on appeal in early 2014. Proponents of these rules want to limit the ways that a broadband Internet access service provider can structure business arrangements and manage its network. The further regulation of broadband, wireless, and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks. Cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology (IT) security may cause equipment failures or disruptions to our operations. Our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share to other communications providers. In addition, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Cyber attacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses and other means for disruption or unauthorized access, on companies, including Verizon, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks or other cyber incidents which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology and networks may be insufficient to repel a major cyber attack in the future. The costs associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cyber security measures, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. Further, certain of Verizons businesses, including the provisioning of security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. In addition, if we fail to prevent the theft of valuable information such as financial data, sensitive information about Verizon and intellectual property, or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against breaches of network or IT security, it could result in damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence. Any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. A natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. In addition, these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation. Verizons debt has increased significantly and could increase further if Verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt. As of December 31, 2013, Verizon had approximately $93.6 billion of outstanding indebtedness, as well as approximately $6.1 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facility. Since that date, Verizon has incurred $20.3 billion of additional indebtedness and became entitled to draw upon an additional $2 billion of borrowing capacity under a 364-day revolving credit agreement. Verizons debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: ##TABLE_START    requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt and the preferred stock issued by the entity acquired from Vodafone, which would reduce the funds Verizon has available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    making it more difficult or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    reducing Verizons flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industry and market conditions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    making Verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    exposing Verizon to increased interest rate risk given that a portion of its debt obligations are at variable interest rates. ##TABLE_END In addition, the term loan agreement Verizon entered into in connection with the Wireless Transaction requires Verizon to maintain a certain leverage ratio unless Verizons credit ratings are at or above a certain level, which could limit Verizons ability to obtain additional financing in the future. Adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing. Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. With approximately 176,800 employees and approximately 209,000 retirees as of December 31, 2013 eligible to participate in Verizons benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, including the continuing implementation of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts. As of December 31, 2013, approximately 28% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. We are currently engaged in contract negotiations with labor unions representing approximately 2,900 employees of our wireline business, and we will engage in additional negotiations as other labor contracts expire in the future. Depending on the outcome of these negotiations, we could incur additional costs and/or experience lengthy work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations, including causing a loss of revenue and strained relationships with customers. We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. Our business faces a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. Sales of shares of Verizon common stock after the completion of the Wireless Transaction may cause the market price of Verizon common stock to fall. As of December 31, 2013, Verizon had approximately 2.86 billion shares of common stock outstanding. Verizon issued approximately 1.27 billion shares of Verizon common stock in connection with the Wireless Transaction. The issuance of these new shares of Verizon common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for Verizon common stock. In addition, many Vodafone shareholders are already shareholders of Verizon and those shareholders may decide not to hold the additional Verizon shares they received in the Wireless Transaction. Other Vodafone shareholders, such as funds with geographic limitations on their permitted investments, may be required to sell the shares of Verizon common stock that they received in the Wireless Transaction. Such sales of Verizon common stock could also have the effect of depressing the market price for Verizon common stock.  ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Our total investment in plant, property and equipment was approximately $221 billion at December 31, 2013 and $210 billion at December 31, 2012, including the effect of retirements, but before deducting accumulated depreciation. Our gross investment in plant, property and equipment consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START At December 31,  2013   2012  Network equipment   80.1%    79.7%  Land, buildings and building equipment   11.2%    11.3%  Furniture and other   8.7%    9.0%      100.0%    100.0%    ##TABLE_END Our properties as a percentage of total properties are as follows: ##TABLE_START At December 31,  2013   2012  Wireline   61.3%    62.4%  Wireless   37.7%    36.5%  Other   1.0%    1.1%      100.0%    100.0%    ##TABLE_END Network equipment consists primarily of cable (aerial, buried, underground or undersea) and the related support structures of poles and conduit, wireless plant, switching equipment, network software, transmission equipment and related facilities. Land, buildings and building equipment consists of land and land improvements, central office buildings or any other buildings that house network equipment, and buildings that are used for administrative and other purposes. Substantially all the switching centers are located on land and in buildings we own due to their critical role in the network and high set-up relocation costs. We also maintain facilities throughout the United States comprised of administrative and sales offices, customer care centers, retail sales locations, garage work centers, switching centers, cell sites and data centers. Furniture and other consists of telephone equipment, furniture, data processing equipment, office equipment, motor vehicles, plant under construction, capitalized non-network computer software costs and leasehold improvements. A portion of our property is subject to the liens of their respective mortgages securing funded debt.  ##TABLE_START ", "3": " Item 3. Legal Proceedings ##TABLE_END On September 15, 2010, the U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bank), as Litigation Trustee for the Idearc Inc. Litigation Trust (Litigation Trust), filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against Verizon and certain subsidiaries challenging the November 2006 spin-off of Verizons former directories business then known as Idearc Inc. U.S. Bank, which represents a group of creditors who filed claims in Idearcs bankruptcy, alleged that Idearc was insolvent at the time of the spin-off or became insolvent shortly thereafter. The Litigation Trust sought over $9 billion in damages. Following a two-week trial in October 2012 limited to the question of the value of Idearc Inc. on the date of the spin-off, on January 22, 2013, the Court issued a decision finding that the value was at least $12 billion. As $12 billion exceeds the value of the debt and cash that Idearc transferred to Verizon on the date of the spin-off, the Court issued a related Order to Show Cause directing the Litigation Trust to submit a brief that explains why any (or all) of its legal claims are viable in light of the courts finding on Idearcs value. In its June 18, 2013 decision, the Court entered judgment for Verizon and its subsidiaries and ruled that U.S. Bank would take nothing on its claims. U.S. Bank appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, where briefing is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2014. On October 25, 2011, a Litigation Trust created during the bankruptcy proceedings of FairPoint Communications, Inc. filed a complaint in state court in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, against Verizon and other related entities. The complaint claims that FairPoints acquisition of Verizons landline operations in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont in March 2008 was structured and carried out in a way that left FairPoint insolvent or led to its insolvency shortly thereafter and ultimately to its October 2009 bankruptcy. The Litigation Trust seeks approximately $2 billion in damages. Verizon removed the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina in November 2011. At the close of discovery in February 2012, Verizon filed a summary judgment motion to dismiss the two counts in the complaintconstructive fraudulent transfer and actual fraudulent transfer. On June 12, 2013, the Court granted Verizons summary judgment motion in part, dismissing the Litigation Trusts constructive fraudulent transfer claim. A two-week bench trial limited to the actual fraudulent transfer claim concluded December 15, 2013. In October 2013, the California Attorney Generals Office notified Verizon California Inc. and other Verizon companies of potential violations of California state hazardous waste statutes primarily arising from the disposal of electronic components, batteries and aerosol cans at certain California facilities. We are cooperating with this investigation and continue to review our operations relating to the management of hazardous waste. While penalties relating to the alleged violations could exceed $100,000, we do not expect that any penalties ultimately incurred will be material. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " Item 4.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities ##TABLE_END The principal market for trading in the common stock of Verizon is the New York Stock Exchange. As of December 31, 2013, there were 585,931 shareowners of record. High and low stock prices, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape of transactions, and dividend data are as follows: ##TABLE_START     Market Price   Cash Dividend Declared        High   Low   2013  Fourth Quarter  $ 51.49   $ 46.03   $ .530   Third Quarter   51.94    45.08    .530   Second Quarter   54.31    47.77    .515   First Quarter   49.59    41.50    .515  2012  Fourth Quarter  $ 47.32   $ 40.51   $ .515   Third Quarter   46.41    42.18    .515   Second Quarter   44.77    36.80    .500   First Quarter   40.48    37.07    .500  ##TABLE_END On February 3, 2011, the Board approved a share buyback program which authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of Verizon common stock terminating no later than the close of business on February 28, 2014. The Board also determined that no additional shares were to be purchased under the previously authorized buyback program. The program permits Verizon to repurchase shares over time, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs. The Company may also enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans from time to time to facilitate repurchases of its shares under this authorization. A Rule 10b5-1 plan permits the Company to repurchase shares at times when it might otherwise be prevented from doing so, provided the plan is adopted when the Company is not aware of material non-public information. During the fourth quarter of 2013, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon common stock. At December 31, 2013, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 96.5 million.

Controls and Procedures ##TABLE_END Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrants disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the registrants disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2013. In the ordinary course of business, we review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes intended to ensure an effective internal control environment. We are continuing an initiative to implement new financial systems that will continue in phases over the next several quarters. We are also continuing an initiative to standardize and centralize transaction-processing activities within our accounting processes, which we expect to continue over the next several years. These initiatives will incorporate certain changes in personnel as well. In connection with these initiatives and the resulting changes in our financial systems and transaction-processing activities, the Company continues to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control processes to ensure that controls over our financial reporting remain effective. Except as noted above, there were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Business ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START General ##TABLE_END Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon, or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the worlds leading providers of communications, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies. With a presence around the world, we offer voice, data and video services and solutions on our wireless and wireline networks that are designed to meet customers demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. Formerly known as Bell Atlantic Corporation, we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We began doing business as Verizon on June 30, 2000 following our merger with GTE Corporation. We have a highly diverse workforce of approximately 177,300 employees. Our principal executive offices are located at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036 (telephone number 212-395-1000). We have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business segments and organize by products and services. ##TABLE_START Wireless  Wireless communications products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided to consumer, business and government customers across the United States. Wireline  Wirelines voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services include broadband video and data, corporate networking solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and around the world. ##TABLE_END The following portions of the 2014 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners are incorporated into this report: ##TABLE_START    Overview on pages 10 through 12; and, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Segment Results of Operations on pages 17 through 23 and in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 68 through 71. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Wireless ##TABLE_END Background Our Wireless segment is primarily comprised of Cellco Partnership doing business as Verizon Wireless. Cellco Partnership was formed as a joint venture in April 2000 by the combination of the United States (U.S.) wireless operations and interests of Verizon and Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone). On September 2, 2013, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement with Vodafone and Vodafone 4 Limited, pursuant to which Verizon agreed to acquire all of Vodafones indirect 45% interest in Verizon Wireless for aggregate consideration of approximately $130 billion (the Wireless Transaction). We completed the Wireless Transaction on February 21, 2014 and, as a result, we acquired 100% ownership of Verizon Wireless. The consideration paid was primarily comprised of cash and Verizon common stock. Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless service provider in the United States as measured by retail connections and revenue. At December 31, 2014, Verizon Wireless had 108.2 million retail connections and 2014 revenues of approximately $87.6 billion, representing approximately 69% of Verizons aggregate revenues. We provide wireless communication services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the U.S. and have the largest fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology and third-generation (3G) EvolutionData Optimized (EV-DO) networks of any U.S. wireless service provider. Our 4G LTE network is available to over 98% of the U.S. population in more than 500 markets covering approximately 309 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. Under this program, we are working with wireless carriers in rural areas to collaboratively build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carriers network assets and our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 MHz C Block and Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum. We have substantially completed the deployment of our 4G LTE network and are focusing our capital spending on adding capacity and density to this network. Wireless Service and Product Offerings Our wireless services are available to our customers receiving service under the Verizon Wireless brand. In addition, customers can obtain wireless products and services that operate on our network from resellers that purchase network access from us on a wholesale basis.  Wireless Services We offer our wireless services on a postpaid and prepaid basis. Retail (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts primarily represent retail customers under contract with Verizon Wireless that are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and use its branded services. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. A postpaid connection represents an individual line of service for a wireless device for which a customer is billed in advance a monthly access charge (access service revenues) in return for a monthly network service allowance, and usage beyond the allowance is billed in arrears (usage service revenues). Approximately 94% of our retail connections received our wireless services on a postpaid basis as of December 31, 2014. Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless services without a long-term contract or credit verification by paying for all services in advance. We offer various postpaid account plans, including our More Everything  plans, single connection plans and plans tailored to the needs of our business customers. Our More Everything plans feature domestic unlimited voice minutes, unlimited domestic and international text, video and picture messaging, cloud storage and a single data allowance that can be shared among up to 10 devices connected to the Verizon Wireless network. Customers that choose our Verizon Edge device payment plan option, which allows customers to upgrade their handset after a minimum of thirty days, subject to certain conditions, also receive discounted monthly access fees on More Everything plans. For an additional monthly access fee, our customers have the option of sharing long distance and roaming minutes among their devices for calls from the United States to, and calls while within, Canada and Mexico. The More Everything plans also include our Mobile Hotspot service at no additional charge. This service enables a customer to activate a personal Wi-Fi hotspot via their smartphone that can provide Internet access to multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices. We also offer various voice and shared data plans for small and large businesses. As of December 31, 2014, More Everything accounts represented approximately 61% of our retail postpaid accounts. We offer our customers a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of our devices. Our messaging services enable our customers to send and receive text, picture and video messages. In addition, access to the Internet is available on all of our smartphones and nearly all of our basic phones. We also offer service that enables our customers to access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets that either have embedded 4G LTE or 3G EV-DO modules or that are used in conjunction with separate devices that enable access to this service, such as USB modems, Jetpacks TM and other dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection. Our customers can access multimedia offerings, mostly provided by third parties, consisting of applications providing music, video, gaming, news and other content. Our business-focused offerings, which are designed to increase productivity, include solutions that enable customers to access the Internet, their corporate intranets and e-mail across our diverse portfolio of wireless devices. Our location-based services provide our customers with directions to their destination and enable our business customers to locate, monitor and communicate with their mobile field workers. Our global data services allow our customers to access data services on our Global Ready Phones from hundreds of international destinations and to access the Internet at such destinations with laptops that are either Global Ready, tethered to a Global Ready Phone, or are used in conjunction with other Global Ready devices, such as certain USB modems or Jetpacks. In addition, depending upon their wireless devices operating system, our customers have access to more than one million applications and services offered by Google Inc. (Google) via Google Play, Apple Inc. (Apple) via iTunes, Microsoft Inc. (Microsoft) via its Windows Phone OS operating system and BlackBerry Limited (BlackBerry) via its BlackBerry App World webstore. Our customers can make and receive calls on their home phone handsets using our wireless network through our Home Phone Connect service or Verizon 4G LTE Broadband Router with Voice service. We also offer LTE Internet (Installed), a high-speed Internet service that provides customers with Internet connections in their homes using our 4G LTE network. In addition, we provide network access and, in some cases, enhanced value added services to support telemetry-type applications, which are characterized by machine-to-machine (M2M) wireless connections. Our M2M services support devices that are used by a variety of vertical market segments, including health monitoring, education, manufacturing, utilities, distribution and consumer products. For example, companies purchase network access and, in some cases, enhanced services from us in order to connect with and monitor equipment, such as medical devices used to monitor patients, fleet management devices used to monitor company-operated vehicles and utility monitoring devices used for smart grid applications. Other companies purchase network access from us to support devices that are included in a service they, in turn, sell to end users. We also support telematics services for some of the largest automotive manufacturers. We expect that consumer use of M2M wireless connections, such as home monitoring, health monitoring, energy management and utilities management will increase as consumers integrate these devices into their mobile lifestyle. Wireless Devices We offer several categories of wireless devices, including smartphones and basic phones, tablets and other Internet access devices. Smartphones and Basic Phones . Nearly all of the smartphones we offer are enabled to utilize our 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO high-speed data services and run on various operating platforms, such as Apple iOS, Google Android, BlackBerry OS, and Windows Phone OS. Most of the basic phones we offer are 3G EV-DO-enabled and have HTML-browsing capability. Tablets and Other Internet Devices. We offer tablets from multiple manufacturers, all of which can access the Internet via our 4G LTE network or a Wi-Fi connection. The tablets run primarily on the Apple iOS, Google Android or Microsoft Windows operating systems. In addition, we offer dedicated devices, which we refer to as Jetpacks, that provide a mobile Wi-Fi 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO connection and are capable of connecting multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices to the Internet at one time. Our customers can also access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on their  computers via data cards, USB modems or through the use of certain laptop computers and netbooks with embedded 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO Mobile Broadband modules. During 2014, we continued to experience strong customer demand for tablets and the percentage of our retail postpaid connection base represented by connections to these devices continued to increase. We purchase a substantial majority of our wireless devices and accessories from Apple, Motorola Mobility, Samsung, LG Electronics, BlackBerry and HTC. A key component of all wireless devices is the chipset, which contains the intelligence of the device. The LTE chipsets used in our 4G LTE-enabled devices are manufactured by various companies, each using its own 4G LTE chipset. To support CDMA-1XRTT and EVDO technologies (with and without 4G LTE), most of our wireless device suppliers currently rely on Qualcomm Incorporated for the manufacture and supply of chipsets. In addition, there are a number of other components common to wireless devices provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly. Network We have the largest 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO networks of any service provider in the United States, with licensed and operational coverage in all of the 100 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas. As of January 22, 2015, our 4G LTE network covered approximately 309 million people in the U.S., including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. We currently have 21 committed program participants that have the potential to provide 4G LTE coverage to approximately three million people and, to date, eighteen participants have commenced 4G LTE operations on such networks. The foundation of our continued success is network reliability, which is the hallmark of the Verizon brand. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services which will fuel profitable growth. The depth and breadth of our network provides our fundamental strength and is the basis for our competitive advantage. In 2014, we announced the deployment of AWS spectrum in our 4G LTE network. This additional bandwidth, which we refer to and brand as XLTE, provides additional network capacity and is currently available in more than 400 markets. Nearly all 4G LTE devices that we currently sell can operate on XLTE. We strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for their wireless services. We design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions, including video, and completions of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds and the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped. We plan to continue to upgrade our network, primarily to increase its capacity and density, by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antennae systems in addition to deploying existing AWS spectrum. We are also exploring strategic opportunities to expand our national network coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses. In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the United States where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the United States. Certain of our roaming agreements can be terminated at-will by either party upon several months notice; however, we do not believe that the termination of any of these at-will agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business. Technology Our primary network technology platforms are 4G LTE and 3G Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). 4G LTE provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to those offered by 3G technologies. In 2014, we commercially launched our mobile Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) service known as Voice over LTE (VoLTE). Advanced Calling 1.0 is a first generation suite of services enabled by VoLTE, which is a technology now being used, in addition to CDMA technology, to provide voice calling services to our customers. Our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service. To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations, we have battery backup at every switch and every cell site in our network. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our cell sites and at every switch location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed to cell sites, if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant backbone Multiprotocol Label Switching network in all critical locations. Spectrum The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services. We have licenses to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 MHz band, also known as cellular spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum, portions of the 700 MHz upper C band and AWS spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands, in areas that, collectively, cover nearly all of the population of the United States.  We anticipate we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. This increasing demand is being driven by growth in customer connections and usage of wireless broadband services, which use more bandwidth and require ever faster rates of speed to stay competitive. We can meet our future spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur. On January 29, 2015, the FCC completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum, which it identified as the AWS-3 band. Verizon participated in that auction, and was the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which we will pay approximately $10.4 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we made a deposit of $0.9 billion related to our participation in this auction. On February 13, 2015, we made a down payment of $1.2 billion for these spectrum licenses. Verizon has submitted an application for these licenses and must complete payment for them in the first quarter of 2015. In addition, Congress has adopted legislation that provides for the establishment and funding of a national public safety network and the reallocation and auction, through the use of voluntary incentive auctions, by 2022 of portions of the existing television broadcast spectrum in the 600 MHz band. The incentive auction related to such spectrum is expected to take place in 2016, although the specific timing of this and other auctions will be determined by future regulatory proceedings. Since we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and may have spectrum surpluses in others, from time to time we exchanged spectrum licenses with other service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future. In other cases, we have entered into intra-market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency. These swaps as well as any spectrum purchases are subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses in each instance. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding spectrum license transactions. Network Equipment and Build-out Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our LTE network deployments for macro sites as well as small cells. Our primary CDMA cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are Alcatel-Lucent, which provides more than half of our CDMA cell site equipment, and Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN) and Ericsson, which together provide nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment. We also rely on Alcatel-Lucent, NSN and Ericsson for our switching equipment. As we continue to build and upgrade our existing network, we must complete a variety of steps, including securing rights to a large number of sites and obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals for macro sites, small cells, in-building systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We utilize tower site management firms, such as Crown Castle International Corp. and American Tower Corporation (American Tower), as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing tower sites. On February 5, 2015, we announced an agreement with American Tower pursuant to which American Tower will have the exclusive rights to lease and operate over 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. Under the terms of the leases, American Tower will have exclusive rights to lease and operate the towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As part of this transaction, we will also sell 165 towers for $0.1 billion. We will sublease capacity on the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates, with options to renew. As the leases expire, American Tower will have fixed-price purchase options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. This transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close during the first half of 2015. Marketing and Distribution Our marketing strategy is focused on offering solutions tailored to the needs of our various customer market groups; promoting our brand; leveraging our extensive distribution network; and jointly marketing our products and services to large business and government customers with Verizons Wireline business units through Verizon Enterprise Solutions, a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of Verizons solutions for medium and large business and government customers globally. Our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television, print, radio, outdoor signage, Internet and point-of-sale media promotions designed to present our corporate message consistently across all of our markets. We use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs. Company-operated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy. Our direct channel, which includes our business-to-business sales operations and systems organization, is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of consumers and local, regional and national business customers. In addition, we have a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers, and we offer fully-automated, end-to-end web-based sales of wireless devices, accessories and service plans. In 2013, we opened our first Verizon Destination Store at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, and in 2014 we opened two additional Destination Stores in Chicago and Houston. These stores focus on the mobile lifestyle and highlight the many ways consumers can use wireless technology in their daily lives. These stores are part of a broader initiative that includes the redesign of our retail stores nationwide into Smart Stores, which showcase the same mobile lifestyle zones as the Verizon Destination Stores but on a smaller scale. In addition, our online store has also been redesigned to deliver a consistent shopping experience for customers, whether accessing the store via their desktop or mobile device.  Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the United States, as well as through the Internet. The majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services, and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us. We also utilize high-profile, national retailers, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target, to sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services. Stores such as Dollar General and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services. We also have entered into agency agreements with a number of broadband, video and voice service providers through which our products and services are sold on a stand-alone basis or bundled with their services. Competition We operate in a highly competitive industry. We compete against other national wireless service providers, including ATT, Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile USA, as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilities-based wireless service providers for resale, including those that buy from us. Competition has intensified and we expect it to remain intense as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels, network investment by our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, the introduction of new products and services, new market entrants, the availability of additional spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, and regulatory changes. Competition may also increase as smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service providers. The wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft, Google, Apple and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless providers voice service or the provision of alternative means of consuming video content in a nonlinear format. We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry: ##TABLE_START   Network reliability, capacity and coverage. We believe that a wireless network that consistently provides high quality and reliable service is a key differentiator in the U.S. market and a driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new wireless service offerings, which in many cases include video content, have led to increased customer usage of wireless services, which, in turn, puts pressure on network capacity. In order to compete effectively, wireless service providers must keep pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through their networks. We believe that our 4G LTE network will help us to keep pace with network capacity requirements and meet customer demand for higher speeds. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Pricing. Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering service plans that include unlimited voice minutes and text messages and a specific amount of data access in varying megabyte or gigabyte sizes or, in some cases, unlimited data usage at competitive prices. Some wireless service providers also allow customers to rollover unused data allowances to the next billing period and are also offering installment plans that decouple service pricing from equipment pricing and blur the traditional boundary between prepaid and postpaid plans. In 2015, we expect that customers will continue to adopt these installment plans, which also offer discounts on the cost of wireless service. Furthermore, some wireless providers are offering new customers price plans that undercut pricing under the customers service plan with its current wireless provider and provide a credit to reimburse early termination fees paid to their former wireless service provider, subject to certain limitations, in addition to promotions targeted specifically to customers of Verizon Wireless. We seek to compete in this area by offering our customers services and equipment that they will regard as the best available value for the price, as well as service plans that meet their wireless service needs. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Customer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers, including those of other wireless providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and focusing on their needs in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. Our competitors also recognize the importance of customer service and are also focused on improving in this area. As part of our efforts to promote long-term relationships with our customers, in 2014 we introduced Verizon Smart Rewards, which is a program that offers a wide variety of rewards to customers in exchange for points they earn in connection with their account-related interactions with Verizon Wireless. The program offers customers discounts and savings on merchandise from well-known brands, as well as discounts and other offers at local shopping and dining venues. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Product and service development. As wireless technologies develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate, continued customer and revenue growth will be increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced data products and services. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative wireless products and services both independently and in collaboration with application and content providers. We also collaborate with various device manufacturers in the development of distinctive smartphones and other wireless devices that can access the growing array of data applications and content available over the Internet. We continue to focus on increasing the penetration of smartphones, tablets and other connected devices throughout our customer base. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Sales and distribution. Key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We believe that attaining the optimal combination of varying distribution channels is important to achieving industry-leading profitability, as measured by operating income. We endeavor to increase sales through our company-operated stores, outside sales teams and telemarketing and web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, as well as through our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations, and manufacturers of laptops and netbooks with embedded 4G LTE and 3G models that can access the Internet on our network in broadband speeds. In addition, we sell network access to both traditional resellers, which resell network services to their end-users, and to various companies to enable wireless communications for their M2M devices or for their provision of telematics services. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START   Capital resources. In order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services, wireless service providers require significant capital resources. We generate significant cash flow from operations, as do some of our competitors. ##TABLE_END Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry, including the factors described above, as well as new technologies, new business models, changes in customer preferences, regulatory changes, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors. ##TABLE_START Wireline ##TABLE_END Background Our Wireline segment provides voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services, including broadband video and data, corporate networking solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and around the world. In 2014, Wireline revenues were $38.4 billion, representing approximately 30% of Verizons aggregate revenues. Wireline Service and Product Offerings We organize our service and product offerings by the primary customers targeted by these offerings  mass markets, global enterprise and global wholesale. In 2014, our Wireline segment sold a non-strategic business, which provides communications solutions to a variety of government agencies. Accordingly, the historical Wireline results for these operations, which were not material to our consolidated financial statements or segment results of operations, have been reclassified to Corporate, eliminations and other to reflect comparable segment operating results. On February 5, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) pursuant to which Verizon will sell its local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida, and Texas, including FiOS Internet and Video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states for approximately $10.5 billion. The transaction, which includes the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizons incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and Texas, does not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The assets and liabilities that will be sold are currently included in Verizons continuing operations. As part of the transaction, Frontier will assume $0.6 billion of indebtedness from Verizon. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions including, among others, receipt of state and federal telecommunications regulatory approvals, and we expect this transaction to close during the first half of 2016. The transaction will result in Frontier acquiring approximately 1.5 million FiOS Internet subscribers, 1.2 million FiOS Video subscribers and the related ILEC businesses from Verizon. This business generated revenues of approximately $5.4 billion, excluding revenue with affiliates, for Verizon in 2013, which is the most recent year for which audited stand-alone financial statements are currently available. In 2012, Verizon acquired HUGHES Telematics, Inc. (HUGHES Telematics). The acquisition has accelerated our ability to bring more telematics offerings to market for existing and new customers. These offerings include our suite of real-time vehicle communications services and applications which connect automobiles with content, applications and services. We provide services to new vehicles in the United States, China and Europe. Mass Markets Mass Markets operations provide broadband services (including high-speed Internet, FiOS Internet and FiOS Video services), local exchange (basic service and end-user access) and long distance (including regional toll) voice services to residential and small business subscribers. In 2014, Mass Markets revenues were $18.0 billion, representing approximately 47% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. Data services. We offer FiOS broadband and high-speed Internet data products with varying throughput speeds, including FiOS Quantum, which includes speeds of 50 megabytes per second (Mbps) or more. We believe that as consumers connect more devices and stream more video, they will require increased broadband speeds. With our FiOS Quantum broadband service and certain other data services, our customers can achieve symmetrical upload and download speeds, which we refer to as SpeedMatch sm , of up to 500 Mbps. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 59% of our FiOS Internet subscribers subscribed to FiOS Quantum. As more data storage and, in some cases, processing is moved to the cloud, we believe that customers will place an increasing value on upstream performance that matches what they already receive for downloads. In 2014, we introduced the FiOS Quantum Gateway Wi-Fi router. This router uses dual-band technology, which allows users to perform both high and low bandwidth activities, and enables a more seamless Internet experience even when using multiple devices. Video Services. We offer video service over our fiber-optic network. As of December 31, 2014, FiOS Video was available to approximately 15 million homes across 12 states, as well as the District of Columbia.  ##TABLE_START   FiOS Quantum TV  In 2014, we introduced FiOS Quantum TV, which provides FiOS TV customers with new features including the ability to record up to 12 shows at once and control live TV from any room in their home. This new service is now available everywhere that FiOS TV is offered. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   FiOS on Demand  With FiOS on Demand, FiOS customers can watch content anytime, anywhere, on any compatible device. Customers who subscribe to FiOS Video and Internet service also have the ability to upload their photos, music and videos to their personal FiOS on Demand Library, which gives them access to this content via various data-capable devices. With the FiOS Mobile App, programming, such as TNT, Nickelodeon, HBO and TBS, can be streamed to a customers tablet or other mobile device. In addition, FiOS TV Widgets provide viewers with on demand access to local weather, traffic and community information, social media applications, such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, gaming and entertainment content, as well as online shopping and other commerce opportunities. The widget platform has evolved in an open-development environment, which provides opportunities for third parties to develop enhanced customer features for our FiOS Video products. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Customer Premise Equipment interoperability  We continue to partner with major corporations to offer further interoperability with various products such as video game consoles, smart televisions and tablets. This technology further expands our initiative to provide customers with the ability to watch content anytime, anywhere, on any data-capable device. ##TABLE_END Voice services. We offer voice services that include local exchange, regional and long distance calling and voice messaging services, as well as VoIP services, which use the Internet or private broadband networks to transmit voice communications. Global Enterprise Global Enterprise offers Strategic services and other core communications services to medium and large business customers, including multinational corporations, as well as state and federal government customers. Global Enterprise jointly markets these services with Verizons other business units through Verizon Enterprise Solutions.

We are continuing to transition customers out of copper-based legacy voice and data services to fiber services including IP and Ethernet. Global Wholesale Global Wholesale provides communications services including data, voice, local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local, long distance and other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers. In 2014, Global Wholesale revenues were $6.2 billion, representing approximately 16% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. A portion of Global Wholesale revenues is generated by a few large telecommunications companies, most of which compete directly with us. Global Wholesale provides the following services, which it jointly markets with Verizons other business units through Verizon Enterprise Solutions: ##TABLE_START   Data services. We offer a robust portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance our wholesale customers networks and provide connections to their end users and subscribers. Our data services include high-speed digital data offerings, such as Ethernet and Synchronous Optical Network, as well as core data circuits, such as DS1s and DS3s. In addition, we receive special access revenue from data services that is generated from carriers that buy dedicated local exchange capacity to support their private networks. ##TABLE_END New Ethernet connectivity in the United States represents the largest data growth opportunity in wholesale, as customers anticipate higher capacity demands in the future. These customers are also migrating networks from time division multiplexing to Ethernet, which will better scale and service the growth of broadband services driven by smartphones, mobile broadband and mobile video. Global Wholesale offers a complete suite of services to support the expansion of 4G and 3G networks. Data services also include certain value-added business services, which leverage many of the same offerings available in the Global Enterprise portfolio, including: ##TABLE_START   Managed services  Offers wholesale customers the opportunity to outsource the management of their networks, security, remote access, and web applications to Verizon; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Mobility  Enables wholesale customers to enhance their portfolio to triple-play or quad-play capability by leveraging wireless devices and services offered through Verizon Wireless that can be packaged and resold under their own carrier brand; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Security  Provides wholesale customers integrated solutions to help their enterprise end-users secure their networks and data. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Voice services .

Network To provide services to our customers, we operate an advanced telecommunications network in the United States and around the world. ##TABLE_START  FiOS . Our goal is to distinguish FiOS as a premier residential broadband service in the United States. As of December 31, 2014, our FiOS service passed over 19.8 million premises. We expect bandwidth demands to grow with the continued emergence of new video and data applications and the proliferation of IP devices in the home. ##TABLE_END The Passive Optical Network technology upon which the FiOS network is deployed positions Verizon to meet growing bandwidth requirements. Our network architecture provides the flexibility to adapt our facilities more easily to future product development. For example, new optical terminals can be added to the fiber-to-the-premise network providing greater bandwidth and new services without any additional field construction. Select field trials have successfully achieved connection speeds of nearly one gigabit per second (Gbps), and when a more advanced next generation technology has been connected to the fiber-optic network, connection speeds of 10 Gbps have been reached, demonstrating the significant growth capacity built into the FiOS platform. Additionally, this advanced optical network is also finding increased application opportunities in the business sector, especially as the industry seeks to migrate to Ethernet-based access services. ##TABLE_START  Global IP . Verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiber networks with long haul, metro and submarine cable assets providing connectivity to customers around the world. Verizons global network encompasses over 800,000 route miles of terrestrial and undersea cable, serving the business community by supporting and enabling far reaching international operations. ##TABLE_END Global IP traffic has increased substantially over the last five years and is expected to continue to grow significantly. This global business is also rapidly evolving to an everything-as-a-service model in which business customers seek cloud-based, converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services. With the continued deployment of its packet optical transport strategy, Verizon is creating a single, high-capacity global network platform that combines optical transport with advanced packet switching technology. The result is a global IP network that can offer powerful solutions to these service demands. In 2014, a number of key infrastructure enhancements and technology upgrades were designed and deployed. With FiOS Quantum, we introduced SpeedMatch and pushed our top tier FiOS service offering to 500 Mbps. We believe that our continued focus on advancing our fiber-based networks and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology deployments will help Verizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential and enterprise customers. Competition The wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify further with traditional, non-traditional and emerging players seeking increased market share. Current and potential competitors include cable companies, wireless service providers, other domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, Internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. In addition, companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale markets. We compete with these full or near-full service providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition, and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth. We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry: ##TABLE_START  Bandwidth (speed) and network reliability: Consumers and small business customers are seeking to leverage high-speed connections for entertainment, communications and productivity. As online and online-enabled activities increase, so will bandwidth requirements, both downstream and upstream. To succeed, we and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing bandwidth requirements. We continue to invest in our network to be able to meet this growing demand. In addition, network reliability and security are increasingly important competitive factors in the global enterprise market. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Pricing: Cable operators, telecommunications companies and integrated service providers use pricing to capture market share from incumbents. Pricing is also a significant factor as non-traditional modes of providing communication services emerge and new entrants compete for customers. For example, VoIP and portal-based calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Customer service : Customers expect industry-leading service from their service providers. As technologies and services evolve, the ability to excel in this area is important for customer acquisition and retention. In Mass Markets, we compete in this area through our service representatives and online support. In Global Enterprise, we provide our customers with ready access to their system and performance information, and we conduct proactive testing of our network to identify issues before they affect customers. In the wholesale business, we believe service improvement can be achieved through continued system automation initiatives. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  Product differentiation: As a result of pricing pressures, providers need to differentiate their products and services. Customers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband and video connections. Converged features, such as integrated wireless and wireline functionality, are becoming similarly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement. ##TABLE_END In the Mass Markets business, cable operators are significant competitors. Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks so that they can offer digital products and services. We continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include high-speed Internet access, digital television and voice services. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. We expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable companies and other providers of VoIP services as well as Internet portal providers. As a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which requires us to allow potential competitors to purchase our services for resale or access components of our network on an unbundled basis at a prescribed cost, competition in our local exchange markets continues. Our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to competitive local exchange carriers at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers. The scope of these obligations going forward and the rates we receive are subject to ongoing review and revision by the FCC and state regulators. (See Regulatory and Competitive Trends.) In the global enterprise market, the customers need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is driving the expansion of the competitive landscape. Major competitors include system integrators, carriers and hardware and software providers. Some of the biggest companies in IT services are either making strategic acquisitions or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending. Many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing, software delivery, communication applications and other computing tasks via the network, rather than on in-house machines. Carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major IT outsourcers. Global Wholesale competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity. ##TABLE_START Strategic Initiatives ##TABLE_END Technology developments, interconnected markets, shifting consumer needs and converging industry ecosystems are creating innovative opportunities for Verizon. Our vision is to be a globally-connected solutions company. Our market solutions are designed to deliver compelling products and services, strengthen our competitive advantage in the marketplace and drive a high-quality experience for our customers. To take advantage of these market trends, we have undertaken several strategic initiatives to further develop innovative products and services and enhance our market agility in the following areas of focus: ##TABLE_START    Interactive Entertainment . We believe the growth in video consumption using mobile devices provides us with an opportunity for revenue growth. We have made investments in converging technologies and services involving content delivery networks (CDNs), video streaming and related consumer hardware to leverage new content models. Our wireless network enables us to move towards a unified video strategy that positions us to take advantage of this growth opportunity. For example, we are using Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service technology to develop our LTE Multicast service, which we expect to be available in 2015. This service has the potential to enhance our network efficiency and provide our customers with access to live streaming video content with virtually no buffering, regardless of the number of devices using the service. In order to continue to meet the changing needs of our customers, we also expect to launch an IP television service in 2015. We also believe it is important to have rights to deliver content over a wireless network that does not require an authentication back to a subscription agreement. For example, our NFL agreement allows our customers to access certain games live on our 4G LTE network without authenticating back to any subscription. ##TABLE_END Customers are increasingly consuming large amounts of broadband data as connected devices and associated online applications continue to experience significant growth and we expect broadband usage to continue to increase. Our FiOS network positions us in the industry with leading broadband speeds and reliability. Broadband represents a growth opportunity for us as the use of over-the-top video and user generated content and data accelerates and the number of connected homes and devices continues to grow. ##TABLE_START    Internet of Things . The adoption of machine-to-machine technology continues to increase, primarily led by the telematics and transportation industries, as well as the fields of education and energy management. Our suite of real-time vehicle communications services and applications connects automobiles with content, services and call centers. Our platform enables factory and aftermarket-installed automotive safety and security features as well as location-based services and vehicle diagnostics. We provide usage-based data services to new vehicles in the United States, China and in Europe. Through our In-Drive solution, we have partnered with a major automotive insurance provider to deliver usage-based insurance programs and other connected applications. Our NetworkFleet solution provides commercial fleet managers throughout North America with real-time access to data that yields operational efficiencies, increased vehicle reliability and improved driver safety. We also provide this service to over 28,500 vehicles operated by Verizon. We are further expanding our telematics portfolio to add asset tracking capabilities. ##TABLE_END  Additionally, we are a partner in a pilot project which will put a 120-mile fully automated highway system in place in Michigan with sensors and cameras communicating with cars to show the possibilities of what can be accomplished with real-time vehicle communications services. We expect this project will show improvements in areas such as energy consumption and safety. During the second quarter of 2015, we expect Verizon Vehicle, a vehicle information and technology service, to be available to consumers. With this subscription-based service, drivers will have diagnostic technology in their vehicles, access to live assistance at the press of a button and will be able to request roadside assistance with GPS accuracy when needed. Verizon Vehicle also offers the ability to connect with a certified mechanic to diagnose potential problems and offer solutions. ##TABLE_START    Digital Media . We have continued to invest in Verizon Digital Media Services, which offers a scalable platform for delivering content including live broadcast, video on-demand, games, software and websites to our customers on their devices at any time. As the digital platform reshapes the delivery of media and entertainment content, there is an increasing need for a stable, high-quality video delivery platform. We aim to disrupt the existing media delivery ecosystem with a simple, end-to-end, global platform that enables the best experience of any content. These services are targeted at media and entertainment companies as well as businesses focused on delivering their digital products and services through the Internet. We also expect, through this platform, to further integrate our FiOS and wireless offerings. The current video and content delivery ecosystem is highly fragmented, made up of large and small players, ranging from commodity CDNs to video providers focused on value-added services. Competition includes traditional operators such as ATT and Level 3 Communications, Inc. and non-traditional operators such as Amazon.com, Inc. and Akamai Technologies, Inc. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Cloud Services . Capitalizing on market growth in cloud services and on enterprise trends toward outsourcing IT infrastructure and services, Verizon utilizes an evolutionary cloud platform built for speed and performance, using our own software-based intellectual property and enterprise-grade reliability. Verizon Cloud Compute and Cloud Storage adopt a new approach to how public clouds are built, enabling customers of all sizes to take advantage of the agility and economic benefit of a generic public cloud along with the reliability and scale of an enterprise-level service. Virtual machines (software-based computers and servers) can be created and deployed in seconds, and users build and pay for what they need. ##TABLE_END Our cloud infrastructure enables real-time analytical capabilities for our M2M customers, providing an end-to-end capability where customers can store, process and analyze large amounts of data on a real-time basis. Our cloud infrastructure also has the ability to handle multiple instances of an application providing global support and availability of the applications without increased latency. The integration of our cloud infrastructure with our telematics assets provides our customers with new and innovative service capabilities that are scalable, and which we believe are operationally superior to other bifurcated approaches. ##TABLE_START    Fostering Effective Partnerships and Alliances . As a market leader in offering differentiated solutions to our connected customers across all their devices at home, at work and on the go, Verizon will continue to focus on strategic partnerships as an important pillar of our future strategy. Strategic partnerships are aimed at complementing and augmenting our strengths, expanding our addressable market, accelerating our pace of innovation, enabling faster delivery of solutions such as media, Internet of Things and cloud to the marketplace, and where possible, lowering our market and execution risk. Strong partnerships are expected to further our efforts to offer comprehensive solutions for our customers. We look to formulate strategic partnerships and alliances with a global orientation which will benefit us in terms of technology sourcing, content acquisition, consumer insights, and application ecosystems. ##TABLE_END We believe these investments will assist us in bringing innovative next generation products and services to market and uncovering new sources of revenue, increasing revenue of existing projects and leveraging our strengths across the company. ##TABLE_START Patents, Trademarks and Licenses ##TABLE_END Verizon owns or has licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad. Verizon also actively grants licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable such companies to utilize certain Verizon intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable such third-party licensees to take advantage of the results of Verizons research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to Verizon, we do not believe that loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations. Verizon periodically receives offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, or cease offering the relevant products or services. ##TABLE_START Acquisitions and Divestitures ##TABLE_END Acquisitions and Divestitures on page 34 of the 2014 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners is incorporated by reference into this report.  ##TABLE_START Regulatory and Competitive Trends ##TABLE_END Regulatory and Competitive Landscape Verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market. Current and potential competitors include other voice and data service providers such as other wireless companies, traditional telephone companies, cable companies, Internet service providers, software and application providers, and other non-traditional companies. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition, and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth. Some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator. The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act or Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation. FCC Regulation Broadband Verizon offers many different broadband and Internet access services. The FCC has adopted a series of orders that impose lesser regulatory requirements on broadband services than apply to older voice and slower data services. In addition, the FCC concluded that both wireline and wireless broadband Internet access services qualify as largely deregulated information services. Our broadband Internet access services are subject to various attempts to impose so-called network neutrality rules, including the potential application of common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. Verizon has been and remains committed to the open Internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want. Our commitment applies to broadband Internet access services provided over both our wireline and wireless networks and can be found on our website at http://responsibility.verizon.com/broadband-commitment. Video Verizon offers a multi-channel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In addition, the Act generally requires companies to obtain a local cable franchise, and the FCC has adopted rules that interpret and implement this requirement. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has typically been required to obtain a franchise from local authorities. Wireline Voice Verizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on newer technologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be common carrier services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions, and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements. Wireless Services The FCC regulates several aspects of Verizon Wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition, and transfer of wireless communications systems. And all wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. Verizon Wireless anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. It can meet spectrum needs by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a competitive bidding process for new spectrum from the FCC. Both processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals, and potential conditions. Today, Verizon Wireless holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon Wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon Wireless would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called open access FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers including construction and geographic coverage requirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 services, roaming obligations, and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities. Intercarrier Compensation and Network Access The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. In many instances, Verizon makes payments to other providers, and in turn Verizon receives some payments from other carriers. In 2011, the FCC issued a broad reform order changing, among other things, the framework for many of the per-minute rates that carriers charge each other for the exchange of voice traffic. The new rules gradually reduce many of these rates to zero. This order is subject to pending reconsideration petitions and appeals. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for  certain wireline special access and other services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services. For example, on the wireline side Verizon sells wholesale circuits to other voice and data service providers. On the wireless side, Verizon purchases special access and other services to transport traffic to and from cell towers. In addition, as required by the Act, Verizon unbundles certain wireline network elements and makes these facilities and services available to other network providers. Universal Service The Communications Act charges the FCC with ensuring that certain groups and areas have access to communications services, including rural and other high-cost areas, low income subscribers, schools and libraries, rural health-care organizations, and deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. The FCC established different subsidy and discount programs to achieve these goals. To pay for these programs, the FCC requires contributions from providers such as Verizon based on reported revenues for certain services. Verizon also receives some payments from some of these programs but is a net payer into them. State Regulation and Local Regulation Wireline Services State public utility commissions regulate Verizons telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as an incumbent local exchange carrier in 13 states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated. In addition, as a video services operator in many states, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and to comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result. Wireless Services The Communications Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does not prohibit states from regulating the other terms and conditions of wireless service. For example, some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose reporting requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving) and taxation matters. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process. ##TABLE_START Environmental Matters ##TABLE_END Reserves have been established to cover environmental matters relating to discontinued businesses and past telecommunications activities. These reserves include funds to address contamination at the site of a former Sylvania facility in Hicksville, NY, which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. In September 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken primary responsibility for addressing the contamination at the site. An adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to the past and future expenses of all of the parties. Adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites requiring remediation. ##TABLE_START Executive Officers ##TABLE_END See Part III, Item 10.

Risk Factors ##TABLE_END The following discussion of Risk Factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition or future performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. Similarly, under these conditions, the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We face significant competition that may reduce our profits. We face significant competition in our industry. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, Internet, local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, application and device providers, electric utilities and providers of VoIP services. While these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits. If we are not able to adapt to changes in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits. Our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services. If our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. In addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services. We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as switch and network equipment and handsets, that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. For example, our handset and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices. If these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers. We also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. Because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry. We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology.  Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and to provide specified products or services. We are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. New laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. For example, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services. As another example, we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called open access FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. In addition, our broadband Internet access services are subject to various attempts to impose so-called network neutrality rules, some of which were affirmed and others vacated on appeal by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in early 2014. Proponents of these rules want to limit the ways that a broadband Internet access service provider can structure business arrangements and manage its network. Some of these parties have urged the FCC to reclassify broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act, thus subjecting these services to traditional utility-style regulation. The FCC has an open proceeding concerning whether and what new regulation to adopt, and on what legal basis. The further regulation of broadband, wireless, and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks. Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks, including through the use of malware, computer viruses, dedicated denial of services attacks, credential harvesting and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our service providers, could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers operations. Cyber attacks against companies, including Verizon, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. Further, the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. These attacks may be committed by company employees or external actors operating in any geography, including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective, and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future. Our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share to other communications providers. The costs associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cyber security measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. The potential costs associated with these attacks could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Further, certain of Verizons businesses, such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. In addition, if we fail to prevent the theft of valuable information such as financial data, sensitive information about Verizon and intellectual property, or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against cyber attacks, it could result in damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence. Any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. A natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. In addition, these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation.  Verizons debt has increased significantly and could increase further if Verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt. As of December 31, 2014, Verizon had approximately $113.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness, as well as approximately $7.9 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facility. Verizons debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: ##TABLE_START    requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt and the preferred stock issued by the entity acquired from Vodafone, which would reduce the funds Verizon has available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    making it more difficult or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    reducing Verizons flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industry and market conditions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    making Verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    exposing Verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that its debt obligations are at variable interest rates. ##TABLE_END In addition, the term loan agreement Verizon entered into in connection with the Wireless Transaction requires Verizon to maintain a certain leverage ratio unless Verizons credit ratings are at or above a certain level, which could limit Verizons ability to obtain additional financing in the future. Adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing. Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. With approximately 177,300 employees and approximately 209,000 retirees as of December 31, 2014 eligible to participate in Verizons benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, including the continuing implementation of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 27% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. In 2015, we will be engaged in contract negotiations with labor unions representing approximately 39,000 employees of our wireline business. During the course of these negotiations we could experience lengthy work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations, including a loss of revenue and strained relationships with customers. We cannot predict the length of any such work stoppage. Depending on the outcome of the negotiations, we may incur additional costs. In addition, while the workforce of our wireless business is almost entirely non-union, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our costs. We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements.  ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Substantially all the switching centers are located on land and in buildings we own due to their critical role in the network and high set-up relocation costs. We also maintain facilities throughout the United States comprised of administrative and sales offices, customer care centers, retail sales locations, garage work centers, switching centers, cell sites and data centers.

Legal Proceedings ##TABLE_END On September 15, 2010, the U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bank), as Litigation Trustee for the Idearc Inc. Litigation Trust (Litigation Trust), filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against Verizon and certain subsidiaries challenging the November 2006 spin-off of Verizons former directories business then known as Idearc Inc. U.S. Bank, which represents a group of creditors who filed claims in Idearcs bankruptcy, alleged that Idearc was insolvent at the time of the spin-off or became insolvent shortly thereafter. The Litigation Trust sought over $9 billion in damages. In its June 18, 2013 decision, the District Court entered judgment for Verizon and its subsidiaries and ruled that U.S. Bank would take nothing on its claims. U.S. Bank appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which upheld the District Courts decision on July 30, 2014. The Litigation Trust has sought review of the decision by the United States Supreme Court. In October 2013, the California Attorney Generals Office notified Verizon California Inc. and other Verizon companies of potential violations of California state hazardous waste statutes primarily arising from the disposal of electronic components, batteries and aerosol cans at certain California facilities. We are cooperating with this investigation and continue to review our operations relating to the management of hazardous waste. While penalties relating to the alleged violations could exceed $100,000, we do not expect that any penalties ultimately incurred will be material. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " Item 4.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities ##TABLE_END The principal market for trading in the common stock of Verizon is the New York Stock Exchange. As of December 31, 2014, there were 664,218 shareowners of record. High and low stock prices, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape of transactions, and dividend data are as follows: ##TABLE_START     Market Price   Cash Dividend        High   Low   Declared  2014  Fourth Quarter  $ 51.73   $ 45.09   $ .550   Third Quarter   53.66    48.20    .550   Second Quarter   50.33    45.85    .530   First Quarter   49.40    45.45    .530  2013  Fourth Quarter  $ 51.49   $ 46.03   $ .530   Third Quarter   51.94    45.08    .530   Second Quarter   54.31    47.77    .515   First Quarter   49.59    41.50    .515  ##TABLE_END Stock Repurchases In March 2014, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a three-year share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of the Companys common stock. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated transactions and on the open market, including through plans complying with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The timing and number of shares purchased under the program, if any, will depend on market conditions and the Companys corporate needs. During the fourth quarter of 2014, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon common stock. At December 31, 2014, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 100 million. In addition to the previously authorized three-year share buyback program, in February 2015, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized Verizon to enter into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement to repurchase $5.0 billion of the Companys common stock. The total number of shares that Verizon will repurchase under the ASR agreement will be based generally upon the volume-weighted average share price of Verizons common stock during the term of the transaction. On February 10, 2015, in exchange for an up-front payment totaling $5.0 billion, Verizon received an initial delivery of 86.2 million shares having a value of approximately $4.25 billion. Final settlement of the transaction under the ASR agreement, including delivery of the remaining shares, if any, that Verizon is entitled to receive, is scheduled to occur in the second quarter of 2015.

Controls and Procedures ##TABLE_END Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrants disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effective internal control established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the registrants disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2014. In the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes that are intended to ensure an effective internal control environment. We are continuing an initiative to implement new financial systems in phases over the next several quarters. We are also continuing an initiative to standardize and centralize transaction-processing activities within our accounting processes, which we expect to continue over the next several years. These initiatives will incorporate certain changes in personnel as well. In connection with these initiatives and the resulting changes in our financial systems and transaction-processing activities, the Company continues to review the design and documentation of our internal control system and to enhance our processes as needed to ensure that controls over our financial reporting remain effective.

Business ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START General  ##TABLE_END Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon, or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the worlds leading providers of communications, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies. With a presence around the world, we offer voice, data and video services and solutions on our wireless and wireline networks that are designed to meet customers demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. Formerly known as Bell Atlantic Corporation, we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We began doing business as Verizon on June 30, 2000 following our merger with GTE Corporation. We have a highly diverse workforce of approximately 177,700 employees. Our principal executive offices are located at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036 (telephone number 212-395-1000). We have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business segments and organize by products and services. ##TABLE_START Wireless  Wireless communications products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided to consumer, business and government customers across the United States. Wireline  Wirelines voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services include broadband video and data, corporate networking solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and around the world. ##TABLE_END The following portions of the 2015 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners are incorporated into this report: ##TABLE_START    Overview on pages 10 through 13; and, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Segment Results of Operations on pages 19 through 24 and in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 71 through 73. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Wireless  ##TABLE_END Background Our Wireless segment, doing business as Verizon Wireless, provides wireless communications services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.). Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless service provider in the U.S. as measured by retail connections and revenue. At December 31, 2015, Verizon Wireless had 112.1 million retail connections and 2015 revenues of approximately $91.7 billion, representing approximately 70% of Verizons aggregate revenues. Verizon Wireless was formed as a joint venture in April 2000 by the combination of the U.S. wireless operations and interests of Verizon and Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone). On September 2, 2013, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement with Vodafone and Vodafone 4 Limited, pursuant to which Verizon agreed to acquire all of Vodafones indirect 45% interest in Verizon Wireless for aggregate consideration of approximately $130 billion (the Wireless Transaction). We completed the Wireless Transaction on February 21, 2014 and, as a result, we acquired 100% ownership of Verizon Wireless. The consideration paid was primarily comprised of cash and Verizon common stock. We have the largest fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology and third-generation (3G) Evolution - Data Optimized (EV-DO) networks of any U.S. wireless service provider. Our 4G LTE network is available to over 98% of the U.S. population in more than 500 markets covering approximately 312 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. Under this program, we are working with wireless carriers in rural areas to collaboratively build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carriers network assets and our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 MHz C Block and Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum. We are focusing our wireless capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G LTE network. In 2015, we announced our commitment to developing and deploying fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology. We are working with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standards development and appropriate requirements for this next generation of wireless technology.  Wireless Service and Product Offerings Our wireless services are available to our customers receiving service under the Verizon Wireless brand. In addition, customers can obtain wireless products and services that operate on our network from resellers that purchase network access from us on a wholesale basis. Wireless Services We offer our wireless services on a postpaid and prepaid basis. Retail (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts primarily represent retail customers with Verizon Wireless that are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and use its branded services. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. A postpaid retail connection represents an individual line of service for a wireless device for which a customer is billed in advance a monthly access charge in return for a monthly network service allowance, and usage beyond the allowance is billed in arrears. Approximately 95% of our retail connections received our wireless services on a postpaid basis as of December 31, 2015. Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. We offer various postpaid account service plans, including shared data plans, single connection plans and plans tailored to the needs of our business customers. Our shared data plans feature domestic unlimited voice minutes, unlimited domestic and international text, video and picture messaging, cloud storage and a single data allowance that can be shared among up to 10 devices on a customers account. For an additional monthly access fee, our customers have the option of sharing long distance and roaming minutes among their devices for calls from the United States to, and calls while within, Canada and Mexico. Shared data plans also include our Mobile Hotspot service at no additional charge. This service enables a customer to activate a personal Wi-Fi hotspot via their smartphone that can provide Internet access to multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices. We also offer various voice and shared data plans for small and large businesses. Customers on our fixed-term service plans have historically paid higher fees for their wireless service in exchange for the ability to purchase their wireless devices at subsidized prices. Under the Verizon device payment program (formerly known as Verizon Edge), our eligible wireless customers purchase phones or tablets at unsubsidized prices on an installment basis (a device installment plan). Customers that activate service on devices purchased under the device payment program or on a compatible device that they already own pay lower service fees (unsubsidized service pricing) as compared to those under our fixed-term service plans. Generally, customers entering into device installment agreements on or after June 1, 2015 are required to repay all amounts due under their device installment agreement before being eligible to upgrade their device. However, certain devices are subject to promotions that allow customers to upgrade to a new device after paying down the minimum percentage of their device installment plan and trading in their device. In August 2015, we launched a simplified shared data plan, the Verizon Plan, that offers customers various sizes of data packages that can be shared among up to 10 devices on a customers account. New customers who wish to participate in this new plan can do so by purchasing a device from Verizon either under our device payment program or at full retail, or by using their own compatible device. In addition, our current customers have the option of either moving to the Verizon Plan, subject to certain restrictions, or keeping their existing plan. We offer our customers a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of our devices. Our messaging services enable our customers to send and receive text, picture and video messages. In addition, access to the Internet is available on all of our smartphones and nearly all of our basic phones. We also offer service that enables our customers to access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets that either have embedded 4G LTE or 3G EV-DO modules or that are used in conjunction with separate devices that enable access to this service, such as USB modems, Jetpacks TM and other dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection. Our customers can access multimedia offerings, provided by Verizon and by third parties, consisting of applications providing music, video, gaming, news and other content. Our business-focused offerings, which are designed to increase productivity, include solutions that enable customers to access the Internet, their corporate intranets and e-mail across our diverse portfolio of wireless devices. Our location-based services provide our customers with directions to their destination and enable our business customers to locate, monitor and communicate with their mobile field workers. Our global data services allow our customers to access data services and the Internet on all of our smartphones and many of our tablets and basic phones from hundreds of international destinations. In addition, depending upon their wireless devices operating system, our customers have access to more than one million applications and services offered by Google Inc. (Google) via Google Play, Apple Inc. (Apple) via iTunes, Microsoft Inc. (Microsoft) via its Windows Phone operating system and BlackBerry Limited (BlackBerry) via its BlackBerry App World webstore. Our customers can make and receive calls on their home phone handsets using our wireless network through our Home Phone Connect service or Verizon 4G LTE Broadband Router with Voice service. We also offer LTE Internet (Installed), a high-speed Internet service that provides customers with Internet connections in their homes using our 4G LTE network. In addition, we provide network access and, in some cases, enhanced value added services to support wireless connections for the Internet of Things (IoT). Our IoT services support devices that are used by a variety of vertical market segments, including health monitoring, education, manufacturing, utilities, distribution and consumer products. For example, companies purchase network access and, in some cases, enhanced services from us in order to connect with and monitor equipment, such as medical devices used to monitor patients, fleet management devices used to monitor company-operated vehicles and utility monitoring devices used for smart grid applications. Other companies purchase network access from us to support devices that are included in a service they, in turn, sell to end users. We also support telematics services for some of the largest automotive manufacturers. We expect that consumer use of IoT wireless connections, such as telematics, home monitoring, health monitoring, energy management and utilities management, will increase as consumers integrate these devices into their mobile lifestyle. (See New Product Development and Strategic Initiatives.)  Wireless Devices We offer several categories of wireless devices, including smartphones and basic phones, tablets and other Internet access devices. Smartphones and Basic Phones . All of the smartphones we offer are enabled to utilize our 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO high-speed data services and run on various operating platforms, such as Apple iOS, Google Android, Windows Phone OS, and BlackBerry OS. Most of the basic phones we offer are 3G EV-DO-enabled and have HTML-browsing capability. Tablets and Other Internet Devices. We offer tablets from multiple manufacturers, all of which can access the Internet via our 4G LTE network or a Wi-Fi connection. The tablets run primarily on the Apple iOS, Google Android or Microsoft Windows operating systems. In addition, we offer dedicated devices, which we refer to as Jetpacks that provide a mobile Wi-Fi 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO connection and are capable of connecting multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices to the Internet at one time. Our customers can also access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on their computers via data cards, USB modems or through the use of certain laptop computers and netbooks with embedded 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO Mobile Broadband modules. During 2015, we continued to experience strong customer demand for tablets and the percentage of our retail postpaid connection base represented by connections to these devices continued to increase. We purchase a substantial majority of our wireless devices and accessories from Apple, Motorola Mobility, Samsung, LG Electronics, BlackBerry and HTC. A key component of all wireless devices is the chipset, which contains the intelligence of the device. The LTE chipsets used in our 4G LTE-enabled devices are manufactured by various companies, each using its own 4G LTE chipset technology. To support CDMA-1XRTT and EV-DO technologies (with and without 4G LTE), most of our wireless device suppliers currently rely on Qualcomm Incorporated for the manufacture and supply of chipsets. In addition, there are a number of other components common to wireless devices provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly. Network We have the largest 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO networks of any service provider in the United States, with licensed and operational coverage in all of the 100 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2015, our 4G LTE network covered approximately 312 million people in the U.S., including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. We currently have 21 committed program participants that have the potential to provide 4G LTE coverage to approximately three million people and, to date, all participants have commenced 4G LTE operations on their networks. The reliability of our wireless network is a key factor for our continued success, and we strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for their wireless services. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services that will fuel profitable growth. The depth and breadth of our network provides our fundamental strength and is the basis for our competitive advantage. We design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions, including video, and completions of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds and maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped. We plan to continue to upgrade our network, primarily to increase its capacity and density, by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antennae systems in addition to deploying existing AWS spectrum. We are also exploring strategic opportunities to expand our national network coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses. Our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service. To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations, we have battery backup at every switch and every cell site in our network. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our cell sites and at every switch location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed to cell sites, if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant Multiprotocol Label Switching backbone network in all critical locations. In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the United States where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the United States. Certain of our roaming agreements can be terminated at-will by either party upon several months notice; however, we do not believe that the termination of any of these at-will agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business. Technology Our primary network technology platforms are 4G LTE and 3G Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). 4G LTE provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3G technologies.  In 2014, we commercially launched our mobile Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service known as Voice over LTE (VoLTE). Advanced Calling 1.0, a first generation suite of services enabled by VoLTE, is now being used, in addition to CDMA technology, to provide voice calling services to our customers. In 2015, we announced our commitment to developing and deploying 5G wireless technology. We launched the Verizon 5G Technology Forum with key industry partners to develop 5G requirements and standards and conduct testing to accelerate the introduction of 5G technologies. We believe that 5G technology will provide higher throughput than the current 4G LTE technology, lower latency and the ability to handle more network traffic as the number of Internet-connected devices grows. We plan to launch field technology trials in 2016. Spectrum The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services. We have licenses to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 MHz band, also known as cellular spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum, portions of the 700 MHz upper C band and AWS spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands, in areas that, collectively, cover nearly all of the population of the United States. In January 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum in the AWS-3 band. We participated in that auction, and were the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. The FCC granted us these spectrum licenses in April 2015. We anticipate we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. This increasing demand is driven by growth in customer connections and usage of wireless broadband services, which use more bandwidth and require ever faster rates of speed to stay competitive. We can meet our future spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur. The FCC will be auctioning television broadcast spectrum in the 600 MHz frequency range through a voluntary incentive auction that will take place in two phases. In the first phase, television broadcasters participating in the auction process will sell their rights to use such spectrum to the FCC. In the second phase, the FCC will resell that spectrum to various auction participants, including wireless service providers and other potential bidders. The incentive auction is scheduled to begin on March 29, 2016. Since we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and may have spectrum surpluses in others, from time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future. In other cases, we have entered into intra-market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency. These swaps as well as any spectrum purchases are subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses in each instance. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding spectrum license transactions. Network Equipment and Build-out Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our LTE network deployments for macro sites as well as small cells. Our primary CDMA cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are Alcatel-Lucent, which provides more than half of our CDMA cell site equipment, and Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN) and Ericsson, which together provide nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment. We also rely on Alcatel-Lucent, NSN and Ericsson for our switching equipment. In January 2016, Nokia Corporation acquired Alcatel-Lucent and combined operations. As we continue to build and upgrade our existing network, we must complete a variety of steps, including securing rights to a large number of sites as well as obtaining zoning, other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for macro cell sites. As we densify our network, we follow a similar process for small cells, in-building systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We utilize tower site management firms, such as Crown Castle International Corp. and American Tower Corporation (American Tower), as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing tower sites. During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. Under the terms of the lease agreements, American Tower has exclusive rights to lease and operate towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, American Tower has fixed-price purchase options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. As part of this transaction, we also sold 162 towers for $0.1 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates, with options to renew. Marketing and Distribution Our marketing strategy is focused on offering solutions tailored to the needs of our various customer market groups; promoting our brand; leveraging our extensive distribution network; and jointly marketing our products and services to large business and government customers with Verizons Wireline business units through the Wireless Business Group, a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of Verizon Wireless solutions for medium and large business and government customers. Our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television, print, radio, outdoor signage, Internet and point-of-sale media promotions designed to present our corporate message consistently across all of our markets. We use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs.  Company-operated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy. We have opened Verizon Destination Stores in various major metropolitan areas, which focus on the mobile lifestyle and highlight the many ways consumers can use wireless technology in their daily lives. These stores are part of a broader initiative that includes the redesign of our retail stores nationwide into Smart Stores, which showcase the same mobile lifestyle zones on a smaller scale. In addition, our direct channel includes our business-to-business sales operations and systems organization and is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of consumers and local, regional and national business customers. In addition, we have a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers, and we offer fully-automated, end-to-end web-based sales of wireless devices, accessories and service plans. Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the United States, as well as through the Internet. The majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services, and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us. We also utilize high-profile, national retailers, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target, to sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services. Stores such as Dollar General and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services. Competition We operate in a highly competitive industry. We compete against other national wireless service providers, including ATT Inc. (ATT), Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile USA, Inc. (T-Mobile USA), as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilities-based wireless service providers for resale, including those that buy from us. Competition is intense as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels, network investment by our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, the introduction of new products and services, new market entrants, the availability of additional spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, and regulatory changes. Competition may also increase as smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service providers. The wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft, Google, Apple and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless providers voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry: ##TABLE_START   Network reliability, capacity and coverage. We believe that a wireless network that consistently provides high quality and reliable service is a key differentiator in the U.S. market and driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new wireless service offerings, which in many cases include video content, have led to increased customer usage of wireless services, which, in turn, puts pressure on network capacity. In order to compete effectively, wireless service providers must keep pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through their networks. We believe that our investments in our 4G LTE network to increase network capacity will enable us to meet customer demand. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Pricing. Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering service plans that include unlimited voice minutes and text messages and a specific amount of data access in varying megabyte or gigabyte sizes or, in some cases, unlimited data usage at competitive prices. Some wireless service providers also allow customers to rollover unused data allowances to the next billing period. Furthermore, some wireless service providers offer price plans to new customers that undercut pricing under the customers service plan with its current wireless provider, and some wireless service providers have bundled wireless service offers with other products. Some wireless providers also offer promotional pricing and incentives targeted specifically to customers of Verizon Wireless. ##TABLE_END Many wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options that decouple service pricing from equipment pricing and blur the traditional boundary between prepaid and postpaid plans. These payment options include device installment plans, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and device leasing arrangements. Historically, wireless service providers offered customers wireless plans whereby, in exchange for the customer entering into a fixed-term service agreement, the wireless service providers significantly, and in some cases fully, subsidized the customers device purchase. Wireless providers recovered those subsidies through higher service fees as compared to those paid by customers on device installment plans. We and many other wireless providers have limited or discontinued the use of device subsidies. As a result of the increased penetration of device installment plans, we expect the number of customers on plans with unsubsidized service pricing to continue to grow in 2016. We compete in this area by offering our customers services and devices that we believe they will regard as the best available value for the price, while meeting their wireless service needs. ##TABLE_START   Customer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers, including those of other wireless providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and focusing on their needs in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. Our competitors also recognize the importance of customer service and are also focused on improving in this area. As part of our efforts to promote ##TABLE_END  long-term relationships with our customers, we offer Verizon Smart Rewards, which is a program that offers a wide variety of rewards to customers in exchange for points they earn in connection with their account-related interactions with Verizon Wireless. The program offers customers discounts and savings on merchandise from well-known brands, as well as discounts and other offers at local shopping and dining venues. ##TABLE_START   Product and service development. As wireless technologies develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate, continued customer and revenue growth will be increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced data products and services.

We also collaborate with various device manufacturers in the development of distinctive smartphones and other wireless devices that can access the growing array of data applications and content available over the Internet. We continue to focus on increasing the penetration of smartphones, tablets and other connected devices throughout our customer base. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Sales and distribution. Key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We believe that attaining the optimal combination of varying distribution channels is important to achieving industry-leading profitability, as measured by operating income. We endeavor to increase sales through our company-operated stores, outside sales teams and telemarketing and web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations, and through manufacturers of laptops and netbooks with embedded 4G LTE and 3G modules that can access the Internet on our network at broadband speeds. In addition, we sell network access to both traditional resellers, which resell network services to their end-users, and to various companies to enable wireless communications for their IoT devices or for their provision of telematics services. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Capital resources. In order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services, wireless service providers require significant capital resources. We generate significant cash flow from operations, as do some of our competitors. ##TABLE_END Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry, including the factors described above, as well as new technologies, new business models, changes in customer preferences, regulatory changes, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors. ##TABLE_START Wireline ##TABLE_END Background Our Wireline segment provides voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services, including broadband video and data, corporate networking solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and around the world. In 2015, Wireline revenues were $37.7 billion, representing approximately 29% of Verizons aggregate revenues. In 2014, our Wireline segment sold a non-strategic business that provides communications solutions to a variety of government agencies. Accordingly, the historical Wireline results for these operations, which were not material to our consolidated financial statements or segment results of operations, have been reclassified to Corporate and other to reflect comparable segment operating results. On February 5, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) pursuant to which Verizon will sell its local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.5 billion net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier. The transaction, which includes the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizons incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and Texas, does not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The assets and liabilities that will be sold are currently included in Verizons continuing operations and classified as assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions including, among others, receipt of federal approvals from the FCC and the antitrust authorities and state regulatory approvals. All federal and state regulatory approvals have been obtained. We expect this transaction to close at the end of the first quarter of 2016. Based on the number of voice connections and Fios Internet and video subscribers, respectively, as of December 31, 2015, the transaction would result in Frontier acquiring approximately 3.4 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios video subscribers and the related ILEC businesses from Verizon. Wireline Service and Product Offerings We organize our service and product offerings by the primary customers targeted by these offerings  mass markets, global enterprise and global wholesale.  Mass Markets Mass Markets operations provide broadband Internet and video services (including high-speed Internet, Fios Internet and Fios video services), and local exchange (basic service and end-user access) and long distance (including regional toll) voice services to residential and small business subscribers. In 2015, Mass Markets revenues were $18.5 billion, representing approximately 49% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. Internet services. We offer Fios Internet and high-speed Internet services with varying throughput speeds. We believe that as consumers connect more devices and stream more video, they will require increased broadband speeds. With our Fios Quantum broadband service and certain other data services, our customers can achieve symmetrical upload and download speeds of up to 500 Mbps. As more data storage and, in some cases, processing is moved to the cloud, we believe that customers will place an increasing value on upstream performance that matches what they already receive for downloads. Video services. We offer video service over our fiber-optic network. As of December 31, 2015, Fios video was available to approximately 16 million homes across 12 states, as well as the District of Columbia. We have several offerings available to our Fios TV customers, including: ##TABLE_START    Fios Quantum TV , which provides customers the ability to record up to 12 shows at once and control live TV from any room in their home; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Fios Custom TV , which offers customers the option of purchasing a package of channels that includes a base set of select national networks and local broadcast stations plus their choice of two sets of channels grouped into various content categories, such as news, sports and entertainment.

In 2015, Global Wholesale revenues were $6.0 billion, representing approximately 16% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. A portion of Global Wholesale revenues are generated by a few large telecommunications companies, most of which compete directly with us. Global Wholesale provides the following services, which it jointly markets with Verizons other business units through Verizon Enterprise Solutions: ##TABLE_START    Data services. We offer a robust portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance our wholesale customers networks and provide connections to their end-users and subscribers. Our data services include high-speed digital data offerings, such as Ethernet and Wavelength services, as well as core data circuits, such as DS1s and DS3s. In addition, we receive revenue from data services that is generated from carriers that buy dedicated local exchange capacity to support their private networks. ##TABLE_END New Ethernet connectivity in the U.S. represents the largest data growth opportunity in wholesale, as customers anticipate higher capacity demands in the future. These customers are also migrating networks from time division multiplexing (TDM) to Ethernet, which will better scale and service the growth of broadband services driven by smartphones, mobile broadband and mobile video. Global Wholesale offers a complete suite of services to support the expansion of 4G and 3G networks. Data services also include certain value-added business services, which leverage many of the same offerings available in the Global Enterprise portfolio, including: ##TABLE_START     Managed services , which offer wholesale customers the opportunity to outsource the management of their networks, security, remote access, and web applications to Verizon; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START     Mobility offerings , which enable wholesale customers to enhance their portfolio to triple-play or quad-play capability by leveraging wireless devices and services offered through Verizon Wireless that can be packaged and resold under their own carrier brand; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START     Security services , which provide wholesale customers integrated solutions to help their enterprise end-users secure their networks and data. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Voice services . We provide switched access services that allow carriers to complete their end-user calls that originate or terminate within our territory.

In addition, we offer services such as colocation, resale and unbundled network elements in compliance with applicable regulations. ##TABLE_END  Network To provide services to our customers, we operate an advanced telecommunications network in the United States and around the world. ##TABLE_START    Fios. Our fiber-to-the-home network through which we provide our Fios residential broadband service has passed over 20.5 million premises in the U.S. as of December 31, 2015. Residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that demand will continue to grow. The continued emergence of new video services, new data applications, and the proliferation of IP devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements for increased data speeds and throughput. We believe that the Passive Optical Network (PON) technology underpinning Fios makes us well positioned to meet these demands in a cost effective and efficient manner. Our PON technology provides the flexibility to adapt our network to deliver increased data speeds and new services without major overhauls or replacements to the fiber optic infrastructure. While deployed initially as a consumer broadband network, the PON infrastructure is finding increased application in the enterprise sector, especially as businesses seek to migrate to Ethernet-based access services. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Global IP . Verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiber networks in the world, providing connectivity to business customers in more than 150 countries and 2,700 cities. Our global IP network includes long haul, metro and submarine assets that span over 800,000 route miles and enable and support far reaching international operations. ##TABLE_END Global IP volume has increased significantly over the last five years and substantial year-over-year growth is expected to continue. We deployed the industrys first 100G ultra-long-haul-system for live traffic in 2009, and have made additional 100G deployments on our European and Asia-Pacific long-haul networks, major U.S. backbone routes, and U.S. metro network. We have also completed a first office application of 200G technology on our U.S. long-haul network. This technology allows more information to be carried on a single wavelength while increasing the distance it can be sent without additional loss of signal quality. Global business is rapidly evolving to an everything-as-a-service model in which business customers seek cloud-based, converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services. With the continued deployment of packet optical transport strategy, Verizon is creating a single, high-capacity global network platform that combines optical transport with advanced packet switching technology. The result is a global IP network that can offer powerful solutions to these service demands. We believe that our continued focus on enhancing our domestic and global fiber-based networks, and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology deployments, will help Verizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential and enterprise customers. Competition The wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify further with traditional, non-traditional and emerging players seeking increased market share. Current and potential competitors include cable companies, wireless service providers, other domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, Internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. In addition, companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale markets. We compete with these full or near-full service providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition, and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth. We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry: ##TABLE_START   Bandwidth (speed) and network reliability: Consumers and small business customers are seeking to leverage high-speed connections for entertainment, communications and productivity. As online and online-enabled activities increase, so will bandwidth requirements, both downstream and upstream. To succeed, we and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing bandwidth requirements. In addition, network reliability and security are increasingly important competitive factors in the global enterprise market. We continue to invest in our network to be able to meet growing bandwidth demand and provide the most reliable and secure network. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Pricing: Cable operators, telecommunications companies and integrated service providers use pricing to capture market share from incumbents. Pricing is also a significant factor as non-traditional modes of providing communication services emerge and new entrants compete for customers. For example, VoIP and portal-based calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Customer service: Customers expect industry-leading service from their service providers. As technologies and services evolve, the ability to excel in this area is important for customer acquisition and retention. In Mass Markets, we compete in this area through our service representatives and online support. In Global Enterprise, we provide our customers with ready access to their system and performance information, and we conduct proactive testing of our network to identify issues before they affect customers. In the Global Wholesale business, we believe service improvement can be achieved through continued system automation initiatives. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START   Product differentiation: As a result of pricing pressures, providers need to differentiate their products and services. Customers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband and video connections. Converged features, such as integrated wireless and wireline functionality, are becoming similarly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Innovation: The delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating. To compete effectively, providers need to continuously review, improve and refine their product portfolio and develop and rapidly deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of the customer. ##TABLE_END In the Mass Markets business, cable operators are significant competitors. Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks so that they can offer digital products and services. We continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include high-speed Internet access, digital television and voice services. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. We expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable companies and other providers of VoIP services as well as Internet portal providers. In addition, customers have more choices for obtaining video content from various online services and that content can be accessed on a TV, computer, tablet or mobile phone. In the global enterprise market, the customers need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is driving the expansion of the competitive landscape. Major competitors include system integrators, carriers and hardware and software providers. Some of the biggest companies in IT services are making strategic acquisitions, divesting non-strategic assets or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending. Many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing, software delivery, communication applications and other computing tasks via the network, rather than on in-house machines. Carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major IT outsourcers. Global Wholesale competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity. We also compete with competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs). Our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to CLECs at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers. ##TABLE_START New Product Development and Strategic Initiatives ##TABLE_END Technology developments, interconnected markets, shifting consumer needs and converging industry ecosystems are creating innovative opportunities for Verizon. We are transforming around the capabilities of our high-performing networks with a goal of future growth based on delivering what customers want and need in the new digital world. Our three tier strategy is to lead at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, develop new business models through global platforms in video and IoT and create certain opportunities in applications and content for incremental monetization. To execute this strategy, we have created an organization devoted to the development of new products and incubation of new businesses. This organization is focused on leveraging all of our assets to create innovative products and services that can provide our customers with integrated solutions that address their wireless and wireline needs. Several strategic initiatives have been undertaken by this organization in the following areas: ##TABLE_START   Digital Media and Interactive Entertainment. Verizon has been investing in emerging technology that taps into the market shift to digital content and advertising. On June 23, 2015, we completed our acquisition of AOL Inc. (AOL). AOL is a leader in digital content and advertising. AOLs business model aligns with our approach, and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a digital advertising platform enhances our ability to further develop future revenue streams. ##TABLE_END We believe the growth in video consumption using mobile devices provides us with an opportunity for revenue growth. We have made investments in converging technologies and services involving content delivery networks (CDNs), video streaming and related consumer hardware to leverage new content models. Our wireless network enables us to move towards a unified video strategy that positions us to take advantage of this growth opportunity. For example, in 2015 we launched go90, a mobile-first social entertainment platform that provides the opportunity for ad-supported mobile video streaming. Digital content available on the go90 platform includes live events, popular web and television content as well as original content. In January 2016, we introduced FreeBee Data, a sponsored data service that enables content providers to provide our customers with access to some or all of the providers mobile content, or sponsor specific consumer actions on a per-click basis, all free of data charges to the customer. In February 2016, we announced we would offer retail postpaid Verizon Wireless customers video streaming in go90 over our 4G LTE network free of data charges via the FreeBee Data 360 sponsored data service. Customers must have the latest version of the go90 application to take advantage of this offer. We also began using Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service technology to develop our LTE Multicast service, which we used to deliver live events in go90 in 2015. This service has the potential to enhance our network efficiency and provide our customers with access to live streaming video content with virtually no buffering, regardless of the number of devices using the service. In order to continue to meet the changing needs of our customers, we also are developing an IP television service. We also believe it is important to have rights to deliver content over a wireless network that does not require an authentication back to a subscription agreement. For example, our NFL agreement allows our customers to access certain games live on our 4G LTE network without authenticating back to any subscription.  We continue to invest in Verizon Digital Media Services, which offers a scalable platform for delivering content, including live broadcasts, video on demand, games, software and websites, to our customers on their devices at any time. As the digital platform reshapes the delivery of media and entertainment content, there is an increasing need for a stable, high-quality video delivery platform. We are focused on providing a simple, end-to-end, global platform for the delivery of media to customers, which we believe will be superior to that offered by the existing and highly fragmented media delivery ecosystem. This platform is targeted at media and entertainment companies as well as businesses focused on delivering their digital products and services through the Internet. We also expect, through this platform, to further integrate our Fios and wireless offerings. Connected devices and associated online applications continue to experience significant growth as customers are increasingly consuming large amounts of broadband data, and we expect broadband usage to continue to increase. Our Fios network positions us in the industry with leading broadband speeds and reliability. Broadband represents a growth opportunity for us as the use of over-the-top video and user generated content and data accelerates and the number of connected homes and devices continues to grow. ##TABLE_START   Internet of Things and Telematics . The adoption of IoT technology continues to increase, primarily led by the telematics and transportation industries, as well as the fields of utility and energy management. Our strategy to simplify the IoT and accelerate its adoption includes the launch in 2015 of ThingSpace, our new IoT platform designed to assist developers create, test, manage and market their IoT-based solutions aimed at major vertical markets, such as energy, health care and connected cities. ThingSpace comes with a portal that includes immediate access to dedicated application programming interfaces as well as partner development kits. ##TABLE_END Through Verizon Telematics, we provide connectivity and telematics to manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz and help businesses manage large vehicle fleets more efficiently. Our suite of real-time vehicle communications services and applications connects automobiles with content services and call centers. Our platform enables factory and aftermarket-installed automotive safety and security features as well as location-based services and vehicle diagnostics. We provide usage-based data services to new vehicles in the United States, China and Europe. Our Networkfleet solution provides commercial fleet managers throughout North America with real-time access to data that yields operational efficiencies, increased vehicle reliability and improved driver safety. We also provide this service to over 28,900 vehicles operated by Verizon. We are further expanding our telematics portfolio to add asset tracking capabilities. During the third quarter of 2015, we announced the availability of Hum, an aftermarket vehicle technology and subscription service, to consumers. With this subscription-based service, drivers will have diagnostic technology in their vehicles, access to live assistance and will be able to request roadside assistance with GPS accuracy when needed. Hum also offers the ability to connect with a certified mechanic to diagnose potential problems and offer solutions. ##TABLE_START   Fostering Effective Partnerships and Alliances . As a market leader in offering differentiated solutions to our connected customers across all their devices at home, at work and on the go, Verizon will continue to focus on strategic partnerships as an important pillar of our future strategy. Strategic partnerships are aimed at complementing and augmenting our strengths, expanding our addressable market, accelerating our pace of innovation, enabling faster delivery of solutions such as media, IoT and cloud to the marketplace and, where possible, lowering our market and execution risk. Strong partnerships are expected to further our efforts to offer comprehensive solutions for our customers. We look to formulate strategic partnerships and alliances with a global orientation, which will benefit us in terms of technology sourcing, content acquisition, consumer insights, and application ecosystems. ##TABLE_END We believe these investments will assist us in bringing innovative next generation products and services to market and uncovering new sources of revenue, increasing revenue from existing projects and leveraging our strengths across the company. ##TABLE_START Patents, Trademarks and Licenses ##TABLE_END Verizon owns or has licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad. Verizon also actively grants licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable such companies to utilize certain Verizon intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable such third-party licensees to take advantage of the results of Verizons research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to Verizon, we do not believe that loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations. Verizon periodically receives offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, or cease offering the relevant products or services.  ##TABLE_START Acquisitions and Divestitures ##TABLE_END Acquisitions and Divestitures on pages 34 through 35 of the 2015 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners is incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_START Regulatory and Competitive Trends ##TABLE_END Regulatory and Competitive Landscape Verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market. Current and potential competitors include other voice and data service providers such as other wireless companies, traditional telephone companies, cable companies, Internet service providers, software and application providers, and other non-traditional companies. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition, and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth. Some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator. The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act or Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation. FCC Regulation Wireless Services The FCC regulates several aspects of Verizons wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition, and transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. Verizon anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. It can meet spectrum needs by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals, and potential conditions. Today, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizons wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called open access FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers including construction and geographic coverage requirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 services, roaming obligations, and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities. Broadband Verizon offers many different broadband services. Traditionally, the FCC has recognized that broadband Internet access services are information services subject to a light touch regulatory approach rather than the traditional, utilities-style regulations that apply to traditional voice services. In its order imposing so-called network neutrality rules, the FCC reversed course in 2015 and declared that broadband Internet access services will now be treated as telecommunications services subject to common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This decision creates uncertainty concerning the level of regulation that will apply to broadband services going forward. These regulations will limit the ways that broadband Internet access service providers can structure business arrangements and manage their networks and could spur additional restrictions, including rate regulation, which could adversely affect broadband investment and innovation. The FCCs decision is being challenged in court, and the proper scope of such regulations is also being debated in Congress. Verizon remains committed to the open Internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want, and our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at http://responsibility.verizon.com/broadband-commitment. Verizon opposes the shift to utilities style regulation, however, which we believe is unnecessary, unlawful and harmful to the broader Internet ecosystem and our customers. Wireline Voice Verizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on newer technologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be common carrier services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions, and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements. Video Verizon offers a multi-channel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In addition, the Act generally requires companies to obtain a local cable franchise, and the FCC has adopted rules that interpret and implement this requirement. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has typically been required to obtain a franchise from local authorities.  Intercarrier Compensation and Network Access The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. In many instances, Verizon makes payments to other providers, and in turn Verizon receives some payments from other carriers. In 2011, the FCC issued a broad reform order changing, among other things, the framework for many of the per-minute rates that carriers charge each other for the exchange of voice traffic. The new rules gradually reduce many of these rates to zero. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline special access and other services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services. For example, on the wireline side Verizon sells wholesale circuits to other voice and data service providers. On the wireless side, Verizon purchases special access and other services to transport traffic to and from cell towers. In addition, as required by the Act, Verizon unbundles certain wireline network elements and makes these facilities and services available to other network providers. Universal Service The Communications Act charges the FCC with ensuring that certain groups and areas have access to communications services, including rural and other high-cost areas, low income subscribers, schools and libraries, rural health-care organizations, and deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. The FCC established different subsidy and discount programs to achieve these goals. To pay for these programs, the FCC requires contributions from providers such as Verizon based on reported revenues for certain services. Verizon also receives some payments from some of these programs but is a net payer into them. State Regulation and Local Regulation Wireless Services The Communications Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does not prohibit states from regulating the other terms and conditions of wireless service. For example, some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose reporting requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving) and taxation matters. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process. Wireline Services State public utility commissions regulate Verizons telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as an incumbent local exchange carrier in 13 states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated. In addition, as a video services operator in many states, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and to comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result. ##TABLE_START Environmental Matters ##TABLE_END Reserves have been established to cover environmental matters relating to discontinued businesses and past telecommunications activities. These reserves include funds to address contamination at the site of a former Sylvania facility in Hicksville, NY, which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. In September 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken primary responsibility for addressing the contamination at the site. An adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to the past and future expenses of all of the parties. Adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites requiring remediation. ##TABLE_START Executive Officers ##TABLE_END See Part III, Item 10.

Risk Factors ##TABLE_END The following discussion of Risk Factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition or future performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. Similarly, under these conditions, the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We face significant competition that may reduce our profits. We face significant competition in our industry. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, Internet, local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, application and device providers and providers of VoIP services. While these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. In addition, wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided  in some cases specifically targeting Verizon Wireless customers. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits. If we are not able to adapt to changes and disruptions in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits. Our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services. If our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. In addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services. We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as switch and network equipment and handsets, that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. For example, our handset and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices. If these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers. We also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. Because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry. We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology.  Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and to provide specified products or services. We are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. New laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. For example, in its order imposing so-called network neutrality regulations, the FCC reversed course in 2015 on the longstanding light touch approach and reclassified broadband Internet access services as telecommunications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation. While the full scope and effect of this new regulatory approach is uncertain, these rules limit the ways that a broadband Internet access service provider can structure business arrangements and manage its network and open the door to additional restrictions, including rate regulation that could adversely affect broadband investment and innovation. These rules are being challenged in the courts and the proper scope of such regulations is being debated in Congress, but the outcome and timing of those challenges and debates remain uncertain. As another example, we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called open access FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. Moreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services. The further regulation of broadband, wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks. Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks, including through the use of malware, computer viruses, dedicated denial of services attacks, credential harvesting and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers operations. Cyber attacks against companies, including Verizon, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. Further, the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. These attacks may be committed by company employees or external actors operating in any geography, including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective, and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future. The inability to operate our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses to Verizon and/or a loss of market share to other communications providers. The costs associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cyber security measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. The potential costs associated with these attacks could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Further, certain of Verizons businesses, such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. In addition, if we fail to prevent the theft of valuable information such as financial data, sensitive information about Verizon and intellectual property, or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against cyber attacks, it could result in lawsuits, government claims, investigations or proceedings, and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence. Any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the  equipment and services we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. A natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. In addition, these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation. Verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if Verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt. As of December 31, 2015, Verizon had approximately $110.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness, as well as approximately $7.9 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facility. Verizons debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: ##TABLE_START    requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt and the preferred stock issued by an entity acquired from Vodafone, which would reduce the funds Verizon has available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    making it more difficult or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    reducing Verizons flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industry and market conditions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    making Verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    exposing Verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that its debt obligations are at variable interest rates. ##TABLE_END In addition, the term loan agreement Verizon entered into in connection with the Wireless Transaction requires Verizon to maintain a certain leverage ratio unless Verizons credit ratings are at or above a certain level, which could limit Verizons ability to obtain additional financing in the future. Adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing. Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. With approximately 177,700 employees and approximately 203,000 retirees as of December 31, 2015 eligible to participate in Verizons benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, including the continuing implementation of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 25% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. Labor contracts covering approximately 36,300 employees of our wireline business expired on August 1, 2015. We continue to be engaged in negotiations with our unions regarding new contracts. During the course of these negotiations we could experience lengthy work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations, including a loss of revenue and strained relationships with customers. We cannot predict the length of any such work stoppage. Depending on the outcome of the negotiations, we may incur additional costs. In addition, while less than 1% of the workforce of our wireless and other businesses are represented by unions, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing these workforces or the potentially negative impact it would have on our costs. We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In  addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. ##TABLE_START I ", "1B": " tem 1B.

Land, buildings and building equipment consists of land and land improvements, central office buildings or any other buildings that house network equipment, and buildings that are used for administrative and other purposes. Substantially all the switching centers are located on land and in buildings we own due to their critical role in the network and high set-up relocation costs. We also maintain facilities throughout the United States comprised of administrative and sales offices, customer care centers, retail sales locations, garage work centers, switching centers, cell sites and data centers. Furniture and other consists of telephone equipment, furniture, data processing equipment, office equipment, motor vehicles, plant under construction and leasehold improvements.

Legal Proceedings ##TABLE_END In October 2013, the California Attorney Generals Office notified Verizon California Inc. and other Verizon companies of potential violations of California state hazardous waste statutes primarily arising from the disposal of electronic components, batteries and aerosol cans at certain California facilities. We are cooperating with this investigation and continue to review our operations relating to the management of hazardous waste. While penalties relating to the alleged violations could exceed $100,000, we do not expect that any penalties ultimately incurred will be material. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " Ite m 4.

Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated transactions and on the open market, including through plans complying with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The timing and number of shares purchased under the program, if any, will depend on market conditions and the Companys capital allocation priorities. During the fourth quarter of 2015, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon common stock. At December 31, 2015, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 97.2 million. In February 2015, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized Verizon to enter into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement to repurchase $5.0 billion of the Companys common stock. On February 10, 2015, Verizon received an initial delivery of 86.2 million shares having a value of approximately $4.25 billion. On June 5, 2015, the ASR agreement was settled and an additional 15.4 million shares were delivered to Verizon and retired. In total, 101.6 million shares were delivered under the ASR at an average repurchase price of $49.21.

Controls and Procedures ##TABLE_END Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrants disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effective internal control established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the registrants disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2015. In the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes that are intended to ensure an effective internal control environment. We are also continuing an initiative to standardize and centralize transaction-processing activities within our accounting processes, which we expect to continue over the next several years. These initiatives will incorporate certain changes in personnel as well. In connection with these initiatives and the resulting changes in our financial systems and transaction-processing activities, the Company continues to review the design and documentation of our internal control system and to enhance our processes as needed to ensure that controls over our financial reporting remain effective. Except as noted above, there were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Business ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START General ##TABLE_END Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon, or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the worlds leading providers of communications, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies. With a presence around the world, we offer voice, data and video services and solutions on our wireless and wireline networks that are designed to meet customers demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. Formerly known as Bell Atlantic Corporation (Bell Atlantic), we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We began doing business as Verizon on June 30, 2000 following our merger with GTE Corporation. We have a highly diverse workforce of approximately 160,900 employees. Our principal executive offices are located at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036 (telephone number 212-395-1000). We have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business segments and organize by products and services. ##TABLE_START Wireless  Wireless communications products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided to consumer, business and government customers across the United States. Wireline  Wirelines voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services include broadband video and data, corporate networking solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and around the world. ##TABLE_END Additional discussion of our reportable segments is included in the 2016 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners under the headings Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview and - Segment Results of Operations and in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which are incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_START Wireless ##TABLE_END Background Our Wireless segment, doing business as Verizon Wireless, provides wireless communications services and products across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.). Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless service provider in the United States as measured by retail connections and revenue. At December 31, 2016, Verizon Wireless had 114.2 million retail connections and 2016 revenues of approximately $89.2 billion, representing approximately 71% of Verizons aggregate revenues. Cellco Partnership (Cellco), which originally held the wireless assets of Bell Atlantic, began operating as Verizon Wireless in April 2000 with both Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone) and Bell Atlantic as partners, following Vodafones contribution of its U.S. wireless assets into Cellco. On September 2, 2013, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement with Vodafone and Vodafone 4 Limited, pursuant to which Verizon agreed to acquire all of Vodafones indirect 45% interest in Verizon Wireless for aggregate consideration of approximately $130 billion (the Wireless Transaction). We completed the Wireless Transaction on February 21, 2014 and, as a result, we acquired 100% ownership of Verizon Wireless. The consideration paid was primarily comprised of cash and Verizon common stock. We have the largest fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology and third-generation (3G) Evolution - Data Optimized (EV-DO) networks of any U.S. wireless service provider. Our 4G LTE network is available to over 98% of the U.S. population in more than 500 markets covering approximately 314 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. Under this program, we are working with wireless carriers in rural areas to collaboratively build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carriers network assets and our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 MHz C Block and Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum. We are adding capacity and density to our 4G LTE network. We are committed to developing and deploying fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology and are working with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standards development and appropriate requirements for this next generation of wireless technology. Based on the outcome of our ongoing pre-commercial trials, we intend to be the first company to deploy a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in the United States. We expect to launch a fixed commercial wireless service supported by this network in 2018.  Wireless Service and Product Offerings Our wireless services are available to our customers receiving service under the Verizon Wireless brand. In addition, customers can obtain wireless products and services that operate on our network from resellers that purchase network access from us on a wholesale basis. Wireless Services We offer our wireless services on a postpaid and prepaid basis. Retail (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts primarily represent retail customers with Verizon Wireless that are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and use its branded services. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. A postpaid retail connection represents an individual line of service for a wireless device for which a customer is billed in advance a monthly access charge in return for a monthly network service allowance, and usage beyond the allowance is billed in arrears. Approximately 95% of our total retail connections were postpaid retail connections as of December 31, 2016. Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. We offer various postpaid account service plans, including shared data plans, single connection plans and other plans tailored to the needs of our customers. Our shared data plans typically feature domestic unlimited voice minutes, unlimited domestic and international text, video and picture messaging, and a single data allowance that can be shared among the wireless devices on a customers account. These allowances will vary from time to time as part of promotional offers or in response to market circumstances. On February 12, 2017, we announced an introductory plan, our new Verizon Unlimited plan, available to our consumer and small business customers, which offers among other things, unlimited domestic voice, data and texting. Both our shared data plans and the Verizon Unlimited plan include our HD (High Definition) Voice, Video Calling and Mobile Hotspot services on compatible devices. HD Voice is a suite of services enabled by Voice over LTE (VoLTE), which delivers calls over our 4G LTE network, and our Video Calling service combines an HD Voice call with real-time video. Our Mobile Hotspot service enables a customer to activate a personal Wi-Fi hotspot via their smartphone that can provide Internet access to multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices. We also offer various voice and shared data plans for small and large businesses. Our simplified shared data plan, the new Verizon Plan, offers customers various sizes of data packages that can be shared among up to 10 devices on a consumer account or 25 devices on a business account. The plan features Carryover Data, which allows customers to carry over unused data to the next month, and Safety Mode, which enables customers to avoid data overage fees by allowing them to continue using data at a reduced data speed after using their data allowance. Certain plans, with higher account access amounts also include calling to and voice, text and data roaming in Mexico and Canada. Customers who wish to participate in this new plan can do so by purchasing a device from Verizon either under our device payment program or at full retail, or by using their own compatible device. Customers on our fixed-term service plans have historically paid higher access fees for their wireless service in exchange for the ability to purchase their wireless devices at subsidized prices. We have largely discontinued this form of device subsidy. Under the Verizon device payment program, our eligible wireless customers purchase wireless devices under a device payment plan agreement. Customers that activate service on devices purchased under the device payment program or on a compatible device that they already own pay lower access fees (unsubsidized service pricing) as compared to those under our fixed-term service plans. Generally, customers entering into device payment plan agreements on or after June 1, 2015 are required to repay all amounts due under their device payment plan agreement before being eligible to upgrade their device. However, certain devices are subject to promotions that allow customers to upgrade to a new device after paying down a specified percentage of the balance on their device payment plan and trading in their device in good working condition. We also offer prepaid single connection service plans that feature domestic unlimited voice minutes and unlimited domestic and international text. On compatible devices, certain of our prepaid plans also feature video and picture messaging, Carryover Data and Always-On Data, which allows a customer to stay online at reduced data speeds after using their data allowance. HD Voice, Video Calling and Mobile Hotspot service are available on compatible devices. Customers can manage their prepaid services on the device using their My Verizon Mobile application or logging in to the My Verizon website. We offer our customers a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of devices. Access to the Internet is available on all smartphones and nearly all basic phones. We also offer service that enables our customers to access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets that either have embedded 4G LTE or 3G EV-DO modules or that are used in conjunction with separate devices that enable access to this service, such as USB modems, Jetpacks TM and other dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection. Our customers can access multimedia offerings, provided by Verizon and by third parties, consisting of applications providing music, video, gaming, news and other content. Our business-focused offerings, which are designed to increase productivity, include solutions that enable customers to access the Internet, their corporate intranets and e-mail across our diverse portfolio of wireless devices. Our location-based services provide our customers with directions to their destination and enable our business customers to locate, monitor and communicate with their mobile field workers. Our global data services allow our customers to access data services and the Internet on all smartphones and many tablets and basic phones from hundreds of international destinations that we sell. A majority of the wireless devices used by our customers can run applications and services offered by Google (a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.) via Google Play or Apple Inc. (Apple) via iTunes. Our customers can also make and receive calls on their home phone handsets using our wireless network through our Home Phone Connect service or Verizon 4G LTE Broadband Router with Voice service. We also offer LTE Internet (Installed), a high-speed Internet service that provides customers with Internet connections in their homes using our 4G LTE network.  We provide network access and, in some cases, enhanced value-added services to support wireless connections for the Internet of Things (IoT). Our IoT services offer end-to-end solutions for various IoT vertical markets, such as: ##TABLE_START    Fleet management and telematics  We provide in-vehicle solutions that enable vehicle navigation, GPS tracking, engine diagnostic monitoring and maintenance alerts; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Energy  We offer solutions targeted to providing the energy sector with greater visibility into energy usage and the ability to remotely monitor devices used to track energy usage; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Agricultural technology  We provide solutions that give farmers critical data they need to improve yields and save costs; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Smart Communities  Our solutions enable localities to collect data from IoT and connected machine technologies with the goal of improving public safety, managing traffic, reducing pollution, identifying revenue generation opportunities, making efficient use of limited resources and attracting businesses, residents and workers. ##TABLE_END We also work with various companies that purchase network access from us to connect their Open Development certified devices, bundled together with their own solutions, which they sell to end-users. Wireless Devices We offer several categories of wireless devices, including smartphones and basic phones, tablets and other Internet access devices. Smartphones and Basic Phones . All of the smartphones we offer are enabled to utilize our 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO high-speed data services. These devices run on various operating platforms, primarily Apple iOS and Google Android. The basic phones we offer are 3G EV-DO-enabled and have HTML-browsing capability. Tablets and Other Internet Devices. We offer tablets from multiple manufacturers, all of which can access the Internet via our 4G LTE network or a Wi-Fi connection. The tablets run primarily on the Apple iOS and Google Android operating systems. In addition, we offer dedicated devices, which we refer to as Jetpacks that provide a mobile Wi-Fi 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO connection and are capable of connecting multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices to the Internet at one time. Our customers can also access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on their computers via data cards, USB modems or through the use of certain laptop computers and netbooks enabled to access our wireless network. We purchase a substantial majority of our wireless devices and accessories from Apple, Samsung, Motorola Mobility, Google, LG Electronics and HTC. A key component of all wireless devices is the chipset, which contains the intelligence of the device. The LTE chipsets used in our 4G LTE-enabled devices are manufactured by various companies, each using its own 4G LTE chipset technology. To support Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)-1XRTT and EV-DO technologies (with and without 4G LTE), most of our wireless device suppliers currently rely on Qualcomm Incorporated for the manufacture and supply of chipsets. In addition, there are a number of other components common to wireless devices provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly. Network We have the largest 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO networks of any service provider in the United States, with licensed and operational coverage in all of the 100 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2016, our 4G LTE network covered approximately 314 million people in the United States, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. We currently have 21 LTE in Rural America partners that provide 4G LTE coverage to an area covering approximately three million people. The reliability of our wireless network is a key factor for our continued success, and we strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for their wireless services. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services that will fuel profitable growth. The depth and breadth of our network provides our fundamental strength and is the basis for our competitive advantage. We design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions, including video, permitting the completion of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds, and maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped. We plan to continue to upgrade our network, primarily to increase its capacity and density, by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antennae systems in addition to deploying existing AWS spectrum. We are also exploring strategic opportunities to increase our network capacity and efficiency through selective acquisitions of spectrum licenses. Our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service. To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations, we have battery backup at every switch and every macrocell in our network. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macrocells and at every switch location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed, if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant Multiprotocol Label Switching backbone network in critical locations.  In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the United States where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the United States. Certain of our roaming agreements can be terminated at will by either party upon several months notice; however, we do not believe that the termination of any of these at-will agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business. Technology Our primary network technology platforms are 4G LTE and 3G CDMA. 4G LTE provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3G technologies. In 2014, we commercially launched our mobile VoLTE service. HD Calling, enabled by VoLTE, is now being used, in addition to CDMA technology, to provide voice calling services to our customers. We are committed to developing and deploying 5G wireless technology. We are densifying our 4G LTE network to add capacity and pre-position us for 5G technology. We launched the Verizon 5G Technology Forum with key industry partners to develop 5G requirements and standards and conduct testing to accelerate the introduction of 5G technologies. We believe that 5G technology will provide higher throughput than the current 4G LTE technology, lower latency and the ability to handle more network traffic as the number of Internet-connected devices grows. Based on the outcome of our ongoing pre-commercial trials, we intend to be the first company to deploy a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in the United States. We expect to launch a fixed commercial wireless service supported by this network in 2018. Spectrum The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services. We have licenses to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 MHz band, also known as cellular spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum, portions of the 700 MHz upper C band and AWS spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands, in areas that, collectively, cover nearly all of the population of the United States. In January 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum in the AWS-3 band. We participated in that auction and were the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. The FCC granted us these spectrum licenses in April 2015. We anticipate we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. This increasing demand is driven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services, that use more bandwidth and require ever faster rates of speed. Additional spectrum may also allow us to offer new products enabled by advances in technology, including emerging 5G and IoT services. We can meet our future spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur. In March 2016, the FCC commenced a voluntary incentive auction of television broadcast spectrum in the 600 MHz frequency range. The auction has finished the reverse and forward clock phases. Any results will be disclosed by the FCC after the completion of the assignment phase and after the FCC announces the close of the auction by public notice. Since we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and may have spectrum surpluses in others, from time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future. In other cases, we have entered into intra-market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency. These swaps as well as any spectrum purchases are subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses in each instance. Additional information regarding spectrum license transactions is included in the 2016 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report. Network Equipment and Build-out Nokia and Ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our LTE network deployments for macro sites as well as small cells. Our primary CDMA cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are Nokia, which provides more than half of our CDMA cell site equipment, and Ericsson, which provides nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment. We also rely on Nokia and Ericsson for our switching equipment. As we continue to build and upgrade our existing network, we must complete a variety of steps, including securing rights to a large number of sites as well as obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for both our macro and small cells. As we densify our network, we follow a similar process for small cells, in-building systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We utilize tower site management firms, such as Crown Castle International Corp. and American Tower Corporation (American Tower), as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing tower sites. During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. Under the terms of the lease agreements, American  Tower has exclusive rights to lease and operate towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, American Tower has fixed-price purchase options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. As part of this transaction, we also sold 162 towers for $0.1 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates, with options to renew. Marketing and Distribution Our marketing strategy is focused on offering solutions tailored to the needs of our various customer market groups; promoting our brand; leveraging our extensive distribution network; and jointly marketing our products and services to large business and government customers with Verizons Wireline business units through the Wireless Business Group, a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of Verizon Wireless solutions for medium and large business and government customers. Our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television, print, radio, outdoor signage, Internet and point-of-sale media promotions designed to present our corporate message consistently across all of our markets. We use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs. Company-operated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy. We have Verizon Destination Stores in various major metropolitan areas, which focus on the mobile lifestyle and highlight the many ways consumers can use wireless technology in their daily lives. These stores are part of a broader initiative that includes the redesign of our retail stores nationwide into Smart Stores, which showcase the same mobile lifestyle zones on a smaller scale. In addition, our direct channel includes our business-to-business sales operations and systems organization and is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of consumers and local, regional and national business customers. In addition, we have a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers, and we offer fully-automated, end-to-end web-based sales of wireless devices, accessories and service plans. Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the United States, as well as through the Internet. The majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services, and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us. We also have relationships with high-profile national retailers, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target, to sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services. Stores such as Dollar General and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services. Competition We operate in a highly competitive industry. We compete against other national wireless service providers, including ATT Inc., Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile USA, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilities-based wireless service providers for resale, including resellers that buy from us. Competition is intense as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels, network investment by our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, the introduction of new products and services, new market entrants, the availability of additional spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, and regulatory changes. Competition may also increase as smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service providers. The wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft, Google, Apple and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless providers voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry: ##TABLE_START    Network reliability, capacity and coverage. We believe that a wireless network that consistently provides high-quality and reliable service is a key differentiator in the U.S. market and driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new wireless service offerings, which in many cases include video content, have led to increased customer usage of wireless services, which, in turn, puts pressure on network capacity. In order to compete effectively, wireless service providers must keep pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through their networks. We believe that our investments in our 4G LTE network to increase network capacity will enable us to meet consumer demand. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Pricing. Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, we and other wireless service providers are offering service plans at competitive prices that include unlimited voice minutes and text messages and a specific amount of data access in varying megabyte or gigabyte sizes or, in some cases, on an unlimited basis subject to certain restrictions. These allowances will vary from time to time as part of promotional offers or in response to market circumstances. We and many other wireless service providers also allow customers on certain plans to carry over unused data allowances to the next billing period, or to stay online at a reduced data speed after using all of a data allowance for a billing period. In addition, some wireless service providers have bundled wireless service offerings with other products while others offer promotional pricing and incentives targeted specifically to customers of Verizon Wireless. ##TABLE_END We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options that distinguish service pricing from equipment pricing and blur the traditional boundary between prepaid and postpaid plans. These payment options include device payment plans,  which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and device leasing arrangements. Historically, wireless service providers offered customers wireless plans whereby, in exchange for the customer entering into a fixed-term service agreement, the wireless service provider significantly, and in some cases fully, subsidized the customers device purchase. Wireless providers recovered those subsidies through higher service fees as compared to those paid by customers on device payment plans. We and many other wireless providers have limited or discontinued this form of device subsidy. ##TABLE_START    Customer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers, including those of other wireless providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and focusing on their needs in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. Our competitors also recognize the importance of customer service and are also focused on improving in this area. As part of our efforts to transform and simplify the customer experience, we launched a new My Verizon app, which allows customers to manage their price plan, data usage, account and billing from their device. As part of our efforts to promote long-term relationships with our customers, we offer Verizon Smart Rewards, which is a program that offers a wide variety of rewards to customers in exchange for points they earn in connection with their account-related interactions with Verizon Wireless. The program offers customers discounts and savings on merchandise from well-known brands, as well as discounts and other offers at local shopping and dining venues. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Product and service development. As wireless technologies develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate, continued customer and revenue growth will be increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced data products and services. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative wireless products and services both independently and in collaboration with application and content providers. We also collaborate with various device manufacturers in the development of distinctive smartphones and other wireless devices that can access the growing array of data applications and content available over the Internet. We continue to focus on increasing the penetration of smartphones, tablets and other connected devices throughout our customer base. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Sales and distribution. The key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We believe that attaining the optimal combination of varying distribution channels is important to achieving industry-leading profitability, as measured by operating income. We endeavor to increase sales through our company-operated stores, outside sales teams and telemarketing, web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations, and through manufacturers of laptops and netbooks with embedded 4G LTE and 3G modules that can access the Internet on our network at broadband speeds. In addition, we sell network access to both traditional resellers, which resell network services to their end-users, and to various companies to enable wireless communications for their IoT devices or services. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Capital resources. In order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services, wireless service providers require significant capital resources. We generate significant cash flow from operations, as do some of our competitors. ##TABLE_END Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry, including the factors described above, as well as new technologies, new business models, changes in customer preferences, regulatory changes, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors. ##TABLE_START Wireline ##TABLE_END Background Our Wireline segment provides voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and around the world. In 2016, Wireline revenues were $31.3 billion, representing approximately 25% of Verizons aggregate revenues. Strategic Transactions On February 5, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) pursuant to which Verizon sold its local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states, for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.3 billion net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier. The transaction, which included the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizons incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and Texas, did not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The transaction closed on April 1, 2016. The transaction resulted in Frontier acquiring approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios video subscribers and the related ILEC businesses from Verizon. Approximately 9,300 Verizon employees who served customers in California, Florida and Texas continued employment with Frontier. The operating results of these businesses are excluded from our Wireline segment for all periods presented to reflect comparable segment operating results consistent with the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.  On February 20, 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire XO Holdings wireline business, which owns and operates one of the largest fiber-based IP and Ethernet networks, for approximately $1.8 billion, subject to adjustment. We completed the acquisition on February 1, 2017. Separately, we entered into an agreement to lease certain wireless spectrum from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO Holdings that holds its wireless spectrum. Verizon has an option, exercisable under certain circumstances, to buy that subsidiary. We are reinventing our network architecture around a common fiber platform that will support both our wireless and wireline technologies. We expect that this new One Fiber architecture will improve our 4G LTE coverage, speed the deployment of 5G, deliver high-speed Fios broadband to homes and businesses and create new opportunities in the small and medium business market. In April 2016, we announced our One Fiber strategy for the city of Boston. We launched One Fiber for consumer and business services to customers in Boston late in 2016. On December 6, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with Equinix, Inc. pursuant to which Verizon will sell 24 customer-facing data center sites in the United States and Latin America for approximately $3.6 billion, subject to certain adjustments. The sale does not affect Verizons data center services delivered from 27 sites in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Canada, or its managed hosting and cloud offerings. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, and is expected to close during the first half of 2017. Wireline Service and Product Offerings We organize our service and product offerings by the primary customers targeted by these offerings  mass markets, global enterprise and global wholesale. Mass Markets Mass Markets operations provide broadband Internet and video services (including high-speed Internet, Fios Internet and Fios video services), and local exchange (basic service and end-user access) and long distance (including regional toll) voice services to residential and small business subscribers. In 2016, Mass Markets revenues were $14.4 billion, representing approximately 46% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. Internet services. We offer Fios Internet and high-speed Internet services with varying throughput speeds. We believe that as consumers connect more devices and stream more video, they will require increased broadband speeds. With our Fios Quantum broadband service and certain other data services, our customers can achieve symmetrical upload and download speeds of up to 500 Mbps, and we recently launched our Instant Internet service, which allows customers in certain markets to achieve symmetrical upload and download speeds of 750 Mbps and higher. As more data storage and, in some cases, processing is moved to the cloud, we believe that customers will place an increasing value on upstream performance that matches what they already receive for downloads. Video services. We offer video service over our fiber-optic network. As of December 31, 2016, Fios video services were available to approximately 14 million homes across 9 states, as well as the District of Columbia. We have several offerings available to our Fios TV customers, including: ##TABLE_START    Fios Quantum TV, which provides customers the ability to record up to 12 shows at once and control live TV from any room in their home; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Fios Custom TV, which provides customers local versions of the Fox, CBS, NBCU, and ABC broadcast stations and other similar local content and offers customers the option of purchasing an Essentials plan that includes a base set of lifestyle, entertainment, pop culture and content for children and national news networks, or a Sports and More plan that includes national and regional sports networks as well as non-sports national networks. Customers can add more sets of categorized channels to their Custom TV package for an additional monthly fee; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Fios on Demand, which gives Fios customers the ability to watch content virtually anytime and anywhere, on any compatible device. Customers who subscribe to Fios Internet and video service also have the ability to upload their photos, music and videos to their personal Fios on Demand Library, which gives them access to this content via various data-capable devices. With the Fios Mobile App, programming, such as ESPN, TNT, Nickelodeon, HBO and TBS, can be streamed to a customers tablet or other mobile device. ##TABLE_END We continue to partner with major corporations to offer further interoperability with various products such as video game consoles, smart televisions and tablets. This technology further expands our initiative to provide customers with the ability to watch content anytime and anywhere on any data-capable device. Voice services. We offer voice services that include local exchange, regional and long distance calling and voice messaging services, as well as Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) services, which use the Internet or private broadband networks to transmit voice communications. Global Enterprise Global Enterprise offers strategic services and other core communications services to medium and large business customers, including multinational corporations, as well as state and federal government customers. Global Enterprise markets these services through Verizon Enterprise Solutions. In 2016, Global Enterprise revenues were $11.6 billion, representing approximately 37% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. Verizon Enterprise Solutions offers an array of advanced information and communication technology services, including Global Internet Protocol (IP) network, cloud and IT solutions, and business communications, IoT, data, security and mobility services. ##TABLE_START    Network products and solutions  These products and solutions primarily include our Private IP, Public Internet, Ethernet and optical networking services.

We offer IT infrastructure services that include colocation and managed hosting in data centers around the globe. Our cloud services include computing, storage, backup, recovery and application platforms our customers rely on to run their business operations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Business communications services  Business communications services primarily include IP communications services, which simplify network management and drive operational efficiencies by enabling the convergence of voice and data traffic on the same access connection; dedicated Internet access, which provides enterprise customers with high-bandwidth dedicated access to Verizons global network; unified communications and collaboration capabilities, which enable customers to communicate in real-time through VoIP and IP conferencing, and emergency communication services, which allow customers to respond effectively to emergencies while maintaining business continuity. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Security services  We offer a suite of data security services to help companies secure their networks, data, applications and infrastructure from security threats while building customer trust and confidence. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Core services  Core services include core voice and data services, which consist of a comprehensive portfolio of global solutions utilizing traditional telecommunications technology, such as conferencing and contact center solutions, and private line and data access networks. Core services also include providing customer premise equipment, and installation, maintenance and site services. We are continuing to transition customers out of copper-based legacy voice and data services to fiber services, including IP and Ethernet. ##TABLE_END Global Wholesale Global Wholesale provides communications services, including data, voice, local dial tone and broadband services, primarily to local, long distance, wireless and other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers. In 2016, Global Wholesale revenues were $5.0 billion, representing approximately 16% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. A portion of Global Wholesale revenues are generated by a few large telecommunications companies, most of which compete directly with us. Global Wholesale provides the following services, which it jointly markets with Verizons other business units through Verizon Enterprise Solutions: ##TABLE_START    Data services. We offer a robust portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance our wholesale customers networks and provide connections to their end-users and subscribers. Our data services include high-speed digital data offerings, such as Ethernet and Wavelength services, as well as core data circuits, such as DS1s and DS3s. In addition, we receive revenue from data services that is generated from carriers that buy dedicated local exchange capacity to support their private networks. ##TABLE_END Data services also include certain value-added business services, which leverage many of the same offerings available in the Global Enterprise portfolio, including: ##TABLE_START    Managed services , which offer wholesale customers security, remote access, web applications and the opportunity to outsource the management of their networks to Verizon; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Mobility offerings , which enable wholesale customers to enhance their portfolio to triple-play or quad-play capability by leveraging wireless devices and services offered through Verizon Wireless that can be packaged and resold under their own carrier brand; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Security services , which provide wholesale customers integrated solutions to help their enterprise end-users secure their networks and data. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Voice services. We provide switched access services that allow carriers to complete their end-user calls that originate or terminate within our territory. In addition, we provide originating and terminating voice services throughout the United States and globally utilizing our time-division multiplexing (TDM) and VoIP networks. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Local services. We offer an array of local dial tone and broadband services to competitive local exchange carriers, some of which are offered to comply with telecommunications regulations. In addition, we offer services such as colocation, resale and unbundled network elements in compliance with applicable regulations. ##TABLE_END Network Verizon operates a large and advanced telecommunications network in the United States and around the world to provide services and solutions to its customers. ##TABLE_START    Fios. Our fiber-to-the-home network through which we provide our Fios residential broadband service has passed over 16.9 million premises in the United States as of December 31, 2016. Residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that demand will continue to grow. The continued emergence of new video services, new data applications and the proliferation of IP devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements for increased data speeds and throughput. We believe that the Passive Optical Network (PON) technology underpinning Fios makes us well positioned to meet these demands in a cost effective and efficient manner. Our PON technology provides the flexibility to adapt our network to deliver increased data speeds and new services without major overhauls or replacements to the fiber-optic infrastructure. ##TABLE_END  While deployed initially as a consumer broadband network, the PON infrastructure is also finding more widespread application in the enterprise sector, especially as businesses increasingly migrate to Ethernet-based access services. ##TABLE_START    Global IP . Verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiber networks in the world, providing connectivity to business customers in more than 150 countries. Our global IP network includes long haul, metro and submarine assets that span over 800,000 route miles and enable and support far reaching international operations. ##TABLE_END Global business is rapidly evolving to an everything-as-a-service model in which business customers seek cloud-based, converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services. With the continued deployment of packet optical transport strategy, Verizon is creating a single, high-capacity global network platform that combines optical transport with advanced packet switching technology. The result is a global IP network that can offer powerful solutions to these service demands. We believe that our continued focus on enhancing our domestic and global fiber-based networks, and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology deployments, will help Verizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential and enterprise customers. Competition The wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify further with traditional, non-traditional and emerging players seeking increased market share. Current and potential competitors include cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, Internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. In addition, companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale markets. We compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth. We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry: ##TABLE_START    Bandwidth (speed) and network reliability: Consumers and small business customers are seeking to leverage high-speed connections for entertainment, communications and productivity. As online and online-enabled activities increase, so will bandwidth requirements, both downstream and upstream. To succeed, we and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing bandwidth requirements. In addition, network reliability and security are increasingly important competitive factors in the global enterprise market. We continue to invest in our network to be able to meet growing bandwidth demand and provide the most reliable and secure network. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Pricing: Cable operators, telecommunications companies and integrated service providers use pricing to capture market share from incumbents. Pricing is also a significant factor as non-traditional modes of providing communication services emerge and new entrants compete for customers. For example, VoIP and portal-based calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Customer service: Customers expect industry-leading service from their service providers. As technologies and services evolve, the ability to excel in this area is important for customer acquisition and retention. In Mass Markets, we compete in this area through our service representatives and online support. In Global Enterprise, we provide our customers with ready access to their system and performance information, and we conduct proactive testing of our network to identify issues before they affect customers. In the Global Wholesale business, we believe service improvement can be achieved through continued system automation initiatives. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Product differentiation: As a result of pricing pressures, providers need to differentiate their products and services. Customers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband and video connections. Converged features, such as integrated wireless and wireline functionality, are becoming similarly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Innovation: The delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating. To compete effectively, providers need to continuously review, improve and refine their product portfolio and develop and rapidly deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of the customer. ##TABLE_END  In the Mass Markets business, cable operators are significant competitors. Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to offer digital products and services. We continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include high-speed Internet access, digital television and voice services. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. We expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable companies and other providers of VoIP services as well as Internet portal providers. In addition, customers have more choices for obtaining video content from various online services and that content can be accessed on a TV, computer, tablet or mobile phone. In the global enterprise market, the customers need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is driving the expansion of the competitive landscape. Major competitors include system integrators, carriers and hardware and software providers. Some of the biggest companies in IT services are making strategic acquisitions, divesting non-strategic assets or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending. Many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing, software delivery, communication applications and other computing tasks via the network, rather than on in-house machines. Carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major IT outsourcers. Global Wholesale competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity. We also compete with competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs). Our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to CLECs at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers. ##TABLE_START New Product Development and Strategic Initiatives ##TABLE_END Technology developments, interconnected markets, shifting consumer needs and converging industry ecosystems are creating innovative opportunities for Verizon. We are transforming around the capabilities of our high-performing networks, with a goal of future growth based on delivering what customers want and need in the new digital world. Our three tier strategy is to lead at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, develop new business models through global platforms in digital media and IoT and deliver solutions to key industry segments for incremental monetization. To execute this strategy, we have created an organization devoted to the development of new products and the cultivation of new businesses. This organization is focused on leveraging all of our assets to create innovative products and services that can provide our customers with integrated solutions that address their needs. Several strategic initiatives have been undertaken by this organization in the areas of digital media, interactive entertainment and IoT and telematics products and services. As a market leader in offering differentiated solutions to our connected customers across their devices at home, at work and on the go, Verizon will continue to focus on strategic partnerships as an important pillar of our future strategy. Strategic partnerships are aimed at complementing and augmenting our strengths, expanding our addressable market, accelerating our pace of innovation, enabling faster delivery of solutions such as media and IoT to the marketplace and, where possible, lowering our market and execution risk. Strong partnerships are expected to further our efforts to offer comprehensive solutions for our customers. We look to formulate strategic partnerships and alliances with a global orientation, which we believe will benefit us in terms of technology sourcing, content acquisition, consumer insights and application ecosystems. We believe these investments will assist us in bringing innovative next generation products and services to market and uncovering new sources of revenue, increasing revenue from existing projects and leveraging our strengths across the company. Digital Media and Interactive Entertainment Verizon has been investing in emerging technology that taps into the market shift to digital content and advertising. We have been investing in video assets and capabilities with a goal of building a global platform and developing new business models for reaching the digital video customer. We believe the growth in video consumption using mobile devices provides us with an opportunity for revenue growth. Through various acquisitions and investments and the launch of video streaming products and services, we are expanding the ways in which we can deliver content to our customers, including the following: ##TABLE_START    In June 2015, we completed our acquisition of AOL Inc. (AOL), a leader in digital content and advertising. AOLs business model aligns with our approach, and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a digital advertising platform enhances our ability to further develop future revenue streams. During 2015, we also acquired Millennial Media, an advertising technology business. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    In July 2016, we entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire the stock of one or more subsidiaries of Yahoo holding all of Yahoos operating business, for approximately $4.83 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the Transaction). On February 20, 2017, we entered into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, the Transaction purchase price will be reduced by $350 million to approximately $4.48 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. The Transaction is expected to provide us with a valuable portfolio of online properties and mobile applications, including market leading content in sports, finance, news and email services, which have attracted over one billion monthly active consumer views. The Transaction is expected to also expand our analytics and ad tech capabilities and enhance our competitive position and value proposition to advertisers. Additional discussion of the Transaction is included in the 2016 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    In 2015, we launched go90, a mobile-first social entertainment platform that provides the opportunity for ad-supported mobile video streaming as well as subscription-based services. Digital content available on the go90 platform includes live events, popular web and television content and original content. In 2016, we introduced StreamPass, which offers streaming of live sports through go90 free of data charges to Verizon Wireless customers on certain data plans. We also introduced FreeBee Data, a sponsored data service that enables content providers to provide our customers with access to some or all of the providers mobile content or to sponsor specific consumer actions on a per-click basis, free of data charges to the customer. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    We have made investments in converging technologies and services involving content delivery networks (CDNs), video streaming and related consumer hardware to leverage new content models. Our wireless network enables us to move towards a unified video strategy that positions us to take advantage of this growth opportunity. We began using Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service technology to develop our LTE Multicast service, which we use to deliver live events in go90. This service has the potential to enhance our network efficiency and provide our customers with access to live streaming video content with virtually no buffering, regardless of the number of devices using the service. We also believe it is important to have rights to deliver content over a wireless network that do not require an authentication back to a subscription agreement. For example, our NFL agreement allows our customers to access certain games live on our 4G LTE network without authenticating back to any subscription. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    We continue to invest in Verizon Digital Media Services, which offers a scalable platform for delivering content, including live broadcasts, video on demand, games, software and websites, to our customers on their devices at any time. As the digital platform reshapes the delivery of media and entertainment content, there is an increasing need for a stable, high-quality video delivery platform. We are focused on providing a simple end-to-end global platform for the delivery of media to customers, which we believe will be superior to that offered by the existing and highly fragmented media delivery ecosystem. This platform is targeted at media and entertainment companies and other businesses focused on delivering their digital products and services through the Internet. We also expect, through this platform, to further integrate our Fios and wireless offerings. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    During 2016, we established Verizon Hearst Media Partners, LLC, a content joint venture with Hearst Entertainment  Syndication (Hearst), to build new multiplatform digital video channels targeted to the mobile millennial audience. In partnership with Hearst, we have also invested in two media companies, AwesomenessTV Holdings, LLC and Complex Media, Inc.  CM Partners, LLC, which are leaders in producing content targeted at key demographics, in order to further diversify our content and distribution businesses within our digital media portfolio. ##TABLE_END Internet of Things and Telematics The adoption of IoT technology continues to grow as companies across a wide range of industries are leveraging IoT technologies to increase efficiency, gain better customer insights, facilitate compliance with regulations and build new business models. Although IoT growth is expanding broadly, adoption is particularly strong in the telematics and transportation industries, as well as the fields of smart communities, healthcare, utilities and energy management. We are building our growth capabilities in the IoT market by developing business models that monetize usage on our network at the connectivity, platform and solution layers. For example, we have developed IoT solutions that address key market needs for electric and other utilities, farms and other purveyors of food and agriculture, drug companies and others with complex supply chains. In addition, our IoT customers can turn the data that our solutions provide into actionable opportunities to develop new services and create revenue growth. Our strategy to simplify IoT technology and accelerate its adoption also includes ThingSpace, an IoT platform. ThingSpace is designed to help developers create, test, manage and market IoT-based solutions aimed at major vertical markets, such as energy, health care and connected cities. ThingSpace comes with a portal that includes immediate access to dedicated application programming interfaces and partner development kits. In October 2016, we acquired Sensity Systems, Inc., a leading provider of IoT solutions for smart communities, in order to add a leading comprehensive suite of smart city solutions. Through Verizon Telematics, we provide connectivity and telematics services and applications to manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz and help businesses manage large vehicle fleets more efficiently. Our suite of real-time vehicle communications services and applications connects automobiles with content services and call centers. Our platform enables factory and aftermarket-installed automotive safety and security features as well as location-based services and vehicle diagnostics. We provide usage-based data services to new vehicles in the United States, China and Europe. Our Verizon Telematics solution provides commercial fleet managers throughout North America with real-time access to data that yields operational efficiencies, increased vehicle reliability and improved driver safety. We also provide this service to over 23,000 vehicles operated by Verizon. In 2015, we introduced hum, an aftermarket vehicle technology and subscription service. This subscription-based service provides consumers with diagnostic technology in their vehicles, access to live assistance and roadside assistance with GPS accuracy when needed. Our hum service also offers the ability to connect with a certified mechanic to diagnose potential problems and offer solutions. In 2016, we acquired Fleetmatics Group PLC, a global provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions, and Telogis, Inc., a global, cloud-based mobile enterprise management software company. We expect these acquisitions to advance our fleet telematics solutions, expand our distribution relationships and position our telematics business as a leading provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions globally.  ##TABLE_START Patents, Trademarks and Licenses ##TABLE_END We own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad. We also actively grant licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable the licensees to take advantage of the results of Verizons research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to us, we do not believe that the loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations. We periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, or cease offering the relevant products or services. ##TABLE_START Acquisitions and Divestitures ##TABLE_END Information about our acquisitions and divestitures is included in the 2016 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners under the heading Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Acquisitions and Divestitures, which is incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_START Regulatory and Competitive Trends ##TABLE_END Regulatory and Competitive Landscape Verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market. Current and potential competitors include other voice and data service providers such as other wireless companies, traditional telephone companies, cable companies, Internet service providers, software and application providers, and other non-traditional companies. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth. Some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator. The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act or Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation. Federal Regulation Wireless Services The FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. Verizon anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. We can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential conditions. Today, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizons wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called open access FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers, including construction and geographic coverage requirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 services, roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities. Broadband Verizon offers many different broadband services. Traditionally, the FCC recognized that broadband Internet access services as information services subject to a light touch regulatory approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-style regulations. In 2015, the FCC reversed course and declared that broadband Internet access services are telecommunications services subject to common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. This decision created uncertainty concerning the level of regulation that will apply to broadband services. It created a risk that such regulation would limit the ways that broadband Internet access service providers structure their business arrangements and manage their networks and could spur additional restrictions, including rate regulation, that could adversely affect broadband investment and innovation. The FCCs decision was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals, but may be subject to further challenge in the courts. In addition, Congress and the FCC are likely to continue to debate the proper scope of such regulations. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains committed to the open Internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want, and our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at http://responsibility.verizon.com/broadband-commitment.  Wireline Voice Verizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be common carrier services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements. Video Verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has typically been required to obtain a franchise from local authorities. Privacy and Data Security We are subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business, including voice, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in the IoT space. At the federal level, much of our business is subject to the FCCs privacy and data security requirements. In November 2016, the FCC released new privacy and data security rules that will apply to all telecommunications services, including our fixed and mobile voice and broadband services. Other parts of our business are subject to the privacy and data security oversight of other federal regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission. Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at both the state and federal level. In addition, a new data protection regulation will go into effect in Europe in May 2018 that includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Public Safety and Cybersecurity The FCC has played a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread availability of both media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In response to recent cyber attacks, however, the FCC or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers. Intercarrier Compensation and Network Access The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline business data services and other services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both makes and receives interconnection payments. The FCC has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates, terms and conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for business data services may be appropriate. State Regulation and Local Regulation Wireless Services The Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does not prohibit states from regulating the other terms and conditions of wireless service. For example, some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose reporting requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving) and taxation matters. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process. Wireline Services State public utility commissions regulate Verizons telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as an incumbent local exchange carrier in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated. In addition, as a video services operator in many states, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations, as a result.  ##TABLE_START Environmental Matters ##TABLE_END Reserves have been established to cover environmental matters relating to discontinued businesses and past telecommunications activities. These reserves include funds to address contamination at the site of a former Sylvania facility in Hicksville, NY, which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. In September 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken primary responsibility for addressing the contamination at the site.

Risk Factors ##TABLE_END The following discussion of Risk Factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition or future performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. Similarly, under these conditions, the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We face significant competition that may reduce our profits. We face significant competition in our industry. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, Internet, local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, application and device providers and providers of VoIP services. While these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. In addition, wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided  in some cases specifically targeting Verizon Wireless customers. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits. If we are not able to adapt to changes and disruptions in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits. Our industry is rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services. If our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. In addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services. We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as switch and network equipment, smartphones and other wireless devices, that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. For example, our smartphone and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices. If these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers. We also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. Because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry. We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology.  Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified products or services. We are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. New laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. For example, we are subject to federal, state and international laws related to privacy and data protection. A new data protection regulation will go into effect in Europe in May 2018 that includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, in its order imposing so-called network neutrality regulations, the FCC reversed course in 2015 on the longstanding light touch approach and reclassified broadband Internet access services as telecommunications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation. While the full scope and effect of this new regulatory approach is uncertain, these rules limit the ways that a broadband Internet access service provider can structure business arrangements, manage its network and open the door to additional restrictions, including rate regulation that could adversely affect broadband investment and innovation. These rules may be subject to further challenge in the courts and the proper scope of such regulations is being debated in Congress and the FCC, but the outcome and timing of those challenges and debates remain uncertain. As another example, we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called open access FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. Moreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services. The further regulation of broadband, wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks. Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks, including through the use of malware, computer viruses, dedicated denial of services attacks, credential harvesting and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers operations. Cyber attacks against companies, including Verizon, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. Further, the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. These attacks may be committed by company employees or external actors operating in any geography, including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective, and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future. The inability to operate our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses to Verizon and/or a loss of market share to other communications providers. The costs associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. The potential costs associated with these attacks could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Further, certain of Verizons businesses, such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. Moreover, our increasing presence in the IoT industry with offerings of telematics products and services, including vehicle telematics, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services. In addition, a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information, such as financial data and sensitive or private personal information, could result in lawsuits and government claims, investigations or proceedings. Any of these occurrences could damage our reputation, adversely impact customer and investor confidence, and could further result in a material adverse effect on Verizons results of operation or financial condition. Natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery  planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. A natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. In addition, these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation. Verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if Verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt. As of December 31, 2016, Verizon had approximately $108.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness, as well as approximately $8.9 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facility. Verizons debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: ##TABLE_START    requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt and the preferred stock issued by an entity acquired in a transaction with Vodafone, which would reduce the funds Verizon has available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    making it more difficult or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    reducing Verizons flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industry and market conditions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    making Verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    exposing Verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that its debt obligations are at variable interest rates. ##TABLE_END In addition, our term loan agreements require Verizon to maintain a certain leverage ratio unless Verizons credit ratings are at or above a certain level, which could limit Verizons ability to obtain additional financing in the future. Adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing. Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. With approximately 160,900 employees and approximately 201,000 retirees as of December 31, 2016 eligible to participate in Verizons benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, including the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding the potential repeal and replacement or modification of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 23% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. While less than 1% of the workforce of our wireless and other businesses outside of wireline are represented by unions, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing these workforces or the potentially negative impact it would have on our costs. We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements.  ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Land, buildings and building equipment consists of land and land improvements, central office buildings or any other buildings that house network equipment, and buildings that are used for administrative and other purposes. Substantially all the switching centers are located on land and in buildings we own due to their critical role in the network and high set-up relocation costs. We also maintain facilities throughout the United States comprised of administrative and sales offices, customer care centers, retail sales locations, garage work centers, switching centers, cell sites and data centers. Furniture and other consists of telephone equipment, furniture, data processing equipment, office equipment, motor vehicles, plant under construction and leasehold improvements. ##TABLE_START ", "3": " Item 3. Legal Proceedings ##TABLE_END In October 2013, the California Attorney Generals Office notified Verizon California Inc. and other Verizon companies of potential violations of California state hazardous waste statutes primarily arising from the disposal of electronic components, batteries and aerosol cans at certain California facilities. We are cooperating with this investigation and continue to review our operations relating to the management of hazardous waste. While penalties relating to the alleged violations could exceed $100,000, we do not expect that any penalties ultimately incurred will be material. On April 1, 2016, we completed the sale to Frontier of our landline business operated by Verizon California Inc. and certain other Verizon landline companies. As a result of this transaction, Frontier now owns and operates Verizon California Inc. and has assumed the liabilities of Verizon California Inc. that may arise as a result of these alleged violations. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " Item 4.

Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated transactions and on the open market, including through plans complying with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The timing and number of shares purchased under the program, if any, will depend on market conditions and the Companys capital allocation priorities. During the fourth quarter of 2016, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon common stock. At December 31, 2016, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 97.2 million.

Business ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START General ##TABLE_ENDVerizon Communications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the worlds leading providers of communications, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies. With a presence around the world, we offer voice, data and video services and solutions on our wireless and wireline networks that are designed to meet customers demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. Formerly known as Bell Atlantic Corporation (Bell Atlantic), we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We began doing business as Verizon on June 30, 2000 following our merger with GTE Corporation. We have a highly diverse workforce of approximately 155,400 employees. Our principal executive offices are located at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036 (telephone number 212-395-1000). We have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business units and organize by products and services, and customer groups, respectively. ##TABLE_START Wireless Wireless communications products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided to consumer, business and government customers across the United States (U.S.). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Wireline Wirelines voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services include broadband video and data services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the U.S. and around the world. ##TABLE_END Additional discussion of our reportable segments is included in the 2017 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners under the headings \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview and - Segment Results of Operations\" and in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries, which are incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_START Wireless ##TABLE_ENDBackground Our Wireless segment, doing business as Verizon Wireless, provides wireless communications products and services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the U.S. Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless service provider in the U.S. as measured by retail connections and revenue. At December 31, 2017, Verizon Wireless had 116.3 million retail connections and 2017 revenues of approximately $87.5 billion, representing approximately 69% of Verizons aggregate revenues. Cellco Partnership (Cellco), which originally held the wireless assets of Bell Atlantic, began operating as \"Verizon Wireless\" in April 2000 with both Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone) and Bell Atlantic as partners, following Vodafones contribution of its U.S. wireless assets into Cellco. We acquired all of Vodafones indirect 45% interest in Verizon Wireless in 2014, which resulted in full ownership of Verizon Wireless. We have the largest fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology network of any U.S. wireless service provider. Our 4G LTE network is available to over 98% of the U.S. population in more than 500 markets covering approximately 319 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. Under this program, we are working with wireless carriers in rural areas to collaboratively build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carriers network assets and our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 MHz C Block and Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum. Approximately 98.5% of our total data traffic in 2017 was carried on our 4G LTE network. Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of fifth-generation ( 5G ) wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services. We continue to work with key partners on innovation, standards development and requirements for this next generation of wireless technology. During 2017, we deployed the largest 5G trial network in the U.S. with active customers. In November 2017, we announced that we will commercially launch 5G wireless residential broadband services in three to five U.S. markets in 2018.  Wireless Service and Product Offerings Our wireless services are available to our customers receiving service under the Verizon Wireless brand, customers that obtain wireless products and services that operate on our network from resellers that purchase network access from us on a wholesale basis and customers that utilize Internet of Things (IoT) services via our network. Wireless Services We offer our wireless services on a postpaid and prepaid basis. Retail (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts primarily represent retail customers with Verizon Wireless that are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and use its branded services. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. A retail postpaid connection represents an individual line of service for a wireless device for which a customer is billed one month in advance a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network service. Approximately 95% of our total retail connections were postpaid connections as of December 31, 2017. Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. We offer various postpaid account service plans, including unlimited plans, shared data plans, single connection plans and other plans tailored to the needs of our customers. Our unlimited plans, available to our consumer and business customers, offer, among other things, unlimited domestic voice, data and texting. Our shared data plans typically feature domestic unlimited voice minutes, unlimited domestic and international text, video and picture messaging, and a single data allowance that can be shared among the wireless devices on a customers account. These allowances will vary from time to time as part of promotional offers or in response to market circumstances. Our unlimited and shared data plans include High Definition (HD) Voice and Video Calling on compatible devices, and certain plans also include Mobile Hotspot services on compatible devices. Our HD Voice services, enabled by Voice over LTE (VoLTE), deliver calls over our 4G LTE network, and our Video Calling service combines an HD Voice call with real-time video. Our Mobile Hotspot service enables a customer to activate a personal Wi-Fi hotspot that can provide Internet access to multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices. Our unlimited plans provide customers the ability to stream DVD or HD quality videos, based on the service plan. We also offer various voice and shared data plans for small and large business customers. Customers on our fixed-term service plans historically paid higher access fees for their wireless service in exchange for the ability to purchase their wireless devices at subsidized prices. As of January 2017, we no longer offer consumers new fixed-term service plans for phones; however, we continue to offer subsidized plans to our business customers, and we also continue to service existing fixed-term plans as consumers move to unsubsidized pricing driven by the activation of devices purchased under the Verizon device payment program. Under this program, eligible customers can purchase wireless devices under a device payment plan agreement. Customers that activate service on such devices pay lower service fees as compared to those under our fixed-term service plans. We also offer prepaid single connection service plans that feature domestic unlimited voice minutes and unlimited domestic and international text. On compatible devices, certain of our prepaid plans also feature video and picture messaging, Carryover Data and Always-On Data, which allows a customer to stay online at reduced data speeds after using their data allowance. HD Voice, Video Calling and Mobile Hotspot service are available on compatible devices. While each of our prepaid plans has traditionally covered a single line of service for one device, in 2017, we expanded our prepaid offerings by giving families the ability to combine individual prepaid plans and choose the data allotment for each member of the family. As with all of our prepaid plans, the family plan does not require an annual contract or credit check. We offer our customers a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of devices. Access to the Internet is available on all smartphones and nearly all basic phones. We also offer service that enables our customers to access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets that either have embedded 4G LTE or third generation (3G) modules or that are used in conjunction with separate devices that enable access to this service, such as USB modems, Jetpacks and other dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection. Our customers can access multimedia offerings, provided by Verizon and by third parties, through applications that provide music, video, gaming, news and other content. Our business-focused offerings, which are designed to increase productivity, include solutions that enable customers to access the Internet, their corporate intranets and e-mail across our diverse portfolio of wireless devices. Our location-based services provide our customers with directions to their destination and enable our business customers to locate, monitor and communicate with their mobile field workers. Our international travel services allow our customers to access voice, text and data services and the Internet on many of our \"World\" 3G or 4G smartphones, tablets or basic phones from over 200 international destinations. We also provide network access needed to deliver various IoT products and services. In addition, we work with various companies that purchase network access from us to connect their Open Development certified devices, bundled together with their own solutions, which they sell to end-users. Wireless Devices We offer several categories of wireless devices, including smartphones and basic phones, tablets and other Internet access devices, manufactured by various suppliers. Smartphones and Basic Phones . All of the smartphones we offer are enabled to utilize our 4G LTE high-speed data services and some are also enabled to utilize 3G as well. These devices run on various operating systems. We offer both 3G enabled and 4G enabled basic phones that also have HTML-browsing capabilities. Tablets and Other Internet Devices. We offer tablets that can access the Internet via our 4G LTE network or a Wi-Fi connection. In addition, we offer dedicated devices, which we refer to as Jetpacks TM , that provide a mobile Wi-Fi 4G LTE and/or 3G connection and are capable of connecting multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices to the Internet at one time. Our customers can also access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on their computers via data cards, USB modems or through the use of certain laptop computers and netbooks enabled to access our wireless network. Wearables. Customers can also choose from connected wearable devices that allow for calls, text, and other notifications when they are away from their compatible phones. These smart watches can share the same mobile number as the customers phone, allowing for seamless communications on-the-go. Network We have the largest 4G LTE network of any service provider in the U.S., with licensed and operational coverage in all of the 100 most populous U.S. Metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2017, our 4G LTE network covered approximately 319 million people in the U.S., including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. We currently have 22 LTE in Rural America partners that provide 4G LTE coverage to an area covering approximately three million people. We consider the reliability of our wireless network as a key factor for our continued success and we strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for their wireless services. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services that will fuel profitable growth. We design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions, including video, permitting the completion of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds, and also maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped. We have been densifying our 4G LTE network by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. Network densification not only enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services, but also positions us for the future deployment of 5G technology. We are also utilizing existing network capabilities to handle increased traffic without interrupting the quality of the customer experience. We have and will continue to deploy advanced technologies such as higher orders of modulation, 4x4 multiple input multiple output, licensed assistance access, and increased cell site density primarily through small cell deployment. Just over 50% of our available low- and mid-band spectrum portfolio is being used for 4G LTE. Our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service. To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations, we have battery backup at every switch and every macrocell in our network. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macrocells and at every switch location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed, if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant Multiprotocol Label Switching backbone network in critical locations. In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the U.S. where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the U.S. Certain of our roaming agreements can be terminated at-will by either party upon several months notice; however, we do not believe that the termination of any of these at-will agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business. Technology Our primary network technology platform is 4G LTE, which provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3G technologies. We use HD Calling, enabled by VoLTE, in addition to 3G Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology, to provide voice calling services to our customers. We are committed to developing and deploying 5G wireless technology. We launched the Verizon 5G Technology Forum with key industry partners to develop 5G requirements and standards and conduct testing to accelerate the introduction of 5G technologies. We expect that 5G technology will provide higher throughput than the current 4G LTE technology, lower latency and enable our network to handle more traffic as the number of Internet-connected devices grows. We intend to be the first company to deploy a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in the U.S. Based on the outcome of our pre-commercial trials in 2017, we announced in November 2017 that we will commercially launch 5G wireless residential broadband services in three to five U.S. markets in 2018. Our Intelligent Edge Network is aggressively evolving our network architecture to a multi-use platform built on deep fiber penetration, providing increased virtualization and opportunities for edge computing services. Spectrum The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice, video and data communications services. We are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 MHz band, also known as cellular spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum, portions of the 700 MHz upper C band and AWS 1 and 3 spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands, in areas that, collectively, cover nearly all of the population of the U.S. In 2017, we entered into transactions to acquire NextLink Wireless LLC (NextLink) and Straight Path Communications Inc. (Straight Path), each of which hold millimeter-wave spectrum licenses. The NextLink acquisition closed on January 10, 2018. The Straight Path acquisition is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2018. The spectrum acquired as part of these transactions will be used for our 5G technology deployment in the 28 and 39 GHz bands. In January 2015, the FCC completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum in the AWS-3 band. We participated in that auction and were the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. The FCC granted us these spectrum licenses in April 2015. We are aggressively refarming 3G bands on 800 MHz and PCS bands for 4G LTE use. We anticipate that we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. This increasing demand is driven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of speed. We can meet our future spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur. In addition to spectrum, we believe that future demand will also be met as we increase the density of our networks and deploy advanced technologies. From time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future. In certain cases, we have entered into intra market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency. These swaps, as well as any spectrum purchases, require us to obtain governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses. Additional information regarding spectrum license transactions is included in the 2017 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report. Network Equipment and Build-out As we continue to build and upgrade our existing LTE network, we must complete a variety of steps, including securing rights to a large number of sites as well as obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for both our macro and small cells. As we densify our network, we follow a similar process for small cells, in-building systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We have relationships with a wide variety of vendors that supply various products and services that support our network operations. We utilize tower site management firms as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing tower sites. During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower), pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. Under the terms of the lease agreements, American Tower has exclusive rights to lease and operate towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, American Tower has fixed-price purchase options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. As part of this transaction, we also sold 162 towers for $0.1 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates, with options to renew. Marketing and Distribution Our marketing strategy is focused on offering solutions tailored to the needs of our various customer market groups; promoting our brand; leveraging our extensive distribution network; and jointly marketing our products and services to large business and government customers with Verizons Wireline businesses through the Wireless Business Group, a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of Verizon Wireless solutions for medium and large business, and Verizon Wireline's Enterprise Solutions group, which serves all of our government customers. Our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television, print, radio, outdoor signage, Internet and point-of-sale media promotions designed to present our corporate message consistently across all of our markets. We use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while controlling customer acquisition costs. Our direct channel includes our business-to-business sales operations and systems organization and is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of consumers and local, regional and national business customers. Company-operated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy. We continue to redesign our retail stores nationwide into the \"Next Gen Design,\" which focuses on our customer's evolving digital lifestyle. We also have Verizon Destination Stores in various major metropolitan areas, which focus on the mobile lifestyle and highlight the many ways consumers can use wireless technology in their daily lives. Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the U.S., as well as through the Internet. The majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us. We also have relationships with high-profile national retailers, which sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services, and with various drugstore chains, which sell our prepaid products and services. Competition We operate in a highly competitive industry. We compete against other national wireless service providers, including ATT Inc., Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile USA, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilities-based wireless service providers for resale, including resellers that buy from us. Competition remains intense as a result of saturation in the wireless market, increased network investment by our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, the introduction of new products and services, new market entrants, the availability of additional spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, and regulatory changes. Competition may also increase as smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service providers. The wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft, Google, Apple and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless providers voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry: ##TABLE_START  Network reliability, capacity and coverage. We consider a wireless network that consistently provides high-quality and reliable service to be a key differentiator in the U.S. market and driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new wireless service offerings, which in many cases include video content, have led to increased customer usage of wireless services, which, in turn, puts pressure on network capacity. In order to compete effectively, wireless service providers must keep pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through their networks. We believe that the depth and breadth of our network provides our fundamental strength and is the basis for our competitive advantage in the wireless marketplace. We expect that our investments in our 4G LTE network to increase network capacity will enable us to meet consumer demand. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Pricing. Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape, with plans that address both the postpaid and prepaid customer. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, we and other wireless service providers are offering service plans at competitive prices that include unlimited data access, voice minutes and text messages, and we also offer plans with data access in varying megabyte or gigabyte sizes. We and many other wireless service providers also allow customers on certain plans to carry over unused data allowances to the next billing period, or to stay online at a reduced data speed after using all of a data allowance for a billing period. In addition, some wireless service providers have bundled wireless service offerings with other products while others offer promotional pricing and incentives targeted specifically to customers of Verizon Wireless. ##TABLE_END We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options that distinguish service pricing from equipment pricing and blur the traditional boundary between prepaid and postpaid plans. These payment options include device payment plans, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and device leasing arrangements. Historically, wireless service providers offered customers wireless plans whereby, in exchange for the customer entering into a fixed-term service agreement, the wireless service provider significantly, and in some cases fully, subsidized the customers device purchase. Wireless providers recovered those subsidies through higher service fees as compared to those paid by customers on device payment plans. We and many other wireless providers have limited or discontinued this form of device subsidy. As of December 31, 2017 we had approximately 80% of our postpaid phone base on unsubsidized service pricing plans, compared with approximately 67% at December 31, 2016. As of January 2017, we no longer offer consumers new fixed-term service plans for phones. However we continue to service existing plans and provide these plans to business customers.  ##TABLE_START  Customer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers, including those of other wireless providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and focusing on their needs in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. Our competitors also recognize the importance of customer service and are also focused on improving in this area. As part of our effort to transform and simplify the customer experience, we developed the My Verizon app, which enables customers to manage their price plan, data usage, account and billing from their devices. To promote long-term relationships with our customers, we launched the Verizon Up program, which offers a variety of rewards to customers in exchange for points they earn in connection with their account-related transactions with Verizon Wireless. The program offers customers discounts on products, services and access to experiences, such as sporting events, shows and concerts. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Product and service development. As wireless technologies develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate, continued customer and revenue growth will be increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced data products and services. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative wireless products and services both independently and in collaboration with application and content providers. We also collaborate with various device manufacturers in the development of distinctive smartphones and other wireless devices that can access the growing array of data applications and content available over the Internet. We continue to focus on increasing the penetration of smartphones, tablets and other connected devices throughout our customer base. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Sales and distribution. The key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We believe that attaining the optimal combination of varying distribution channels is important to achieving industry-leading profitability, as measured by operating income. We endeavor to increase sales through our company-operated stores, outside sales teams and telemarketing, web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations, and through manufacturers of laptops and netbooks with embedded 4G LTE and 3G modules that can access the Internet on our network at broadband speeds. In addition, we sell network access to both traditional resellers, which resell network services to their end-users, and to various companies to enable wireless communications for their IoT devices or services. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Capital resources. In order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services, wireless service providers require significant capital resources. We generate significant cash flow from operations, as do some of our competitors. ##TABLE_END Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry. These include the factors described above, as well as new technologies, new business models, changes in customer preferences, regulatory changes, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies that bundle the services of wireless and cable competitors. ##TABLE_START Wireline ##TABLE_ENDBackground Our Wireline segment provides voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services, including broadband video and data services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the U.S. and around the world. In 2017, Wireline revenues were $30.7 billion, representing approximately 24% of Verizons aggregate revenues. During the first quarter of 2017, Verizon reorganized the customer groups within its Wireline segment. Previously, the customer groups in the Wireline segment consisted of Mass Markets (which included Consumer Retail and Small Business subgroups), Global Enterprise, and Global Wholesale. Pursuant to the reorganization, there are now four customer groups within the Wireline segment: Consumer Markets, which includes the customers previously included in Consumer Retail; Enterprise Solutions, which includes the large business customers, including multinational corporations, and federal government customers previously included in Global Enterprise; Partner Solutions, which includes the customers previously included in Global Wholesale; and Business Markets, a new customer group, which includes U.S.-based small business customers previously included in Mass Markets and U.S.-based medium business customers, state and local government customers and educational institutions previously included in Global Enterprise. To compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper based products (such as voice services), we continue to build our Wireline business around a fiber-based network supporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. We are reinventing our network architecture around a common fiber platform that will support both our wireless and wireline businesses. We expect our One Fiber \"multi-use fiber\" initiative will aid in the densification of our 4G LTE wireless network and position us for the future deployment of 5G technology. The expansion of our multi-use fiber footprint also creates opportunities to generate revenue from fiber-based services in our Wireline business. We continue to seek ways to increase revenue, further realize operating and capital efficiencies and maximize profitability across the segment. Strategic Transactions In April 2016, we completed the sale (Access Line Sale) of our local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states to Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.3 billion net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier. The transaction, which included the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizons incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and Texas, did not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The transaction resulted in Frontier acquiring approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios video subscribers and the related ILEC businesses from Verizon. Approximately 9,300 Verizon employees who served customers in California, Florida and Texas continued employment with Frontier. In December 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2017, with Equinix , Inc. (Equinix)  pursuant to which we agreed to sell 23  customer-facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin America for approximately  $3.6 billion , subject to certain adjustments (Data Center Sale) . The transaction closed in May 2017. The operating results of these businesses are excluded from our Wireline segment for all periods presented to reflect comparable segment operating results consistent with the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. In February 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire  XO Holdings wireline business ( XO ) , which owned and operated one of the largest fiber-based  Internet Protocol ( IP ) and Ethernet networks in the U.S. Concurrently, we entered into a separate agreement to utilize certain wireless spectrum from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO Holdings, NextLink, that holds its wireless spectrum, which included an option, subject to certain conditions, to buy the subsidiary. In February 2017, we completed our acquisition of XO for total cash consideration of approximately  $1.5 billion , of which  $0.1 billion was paid in 2015 . In April 2017, we exercised our option to buy NextLink for approximately  $0.5 billion , subject to certain adjustments. The transaction closed in January 2018. The spectrum acquired as part of the transaction will be used for our 5G technology deployment. In August 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase certain fiber-optic network assets in the Chicago market from  WideOpenWest, Inc. ( WOW! ) , a leading provider of communications services. The transaction closed in December 2017. In addition, the parties entered into a separate agreement pursuant to which WOW! will complete the build-out of the network assets we acquired by the second half of 2018. The total cash consideration for the transactions is expected to be approximately  $0.3 billion , of which  $0.2 billion  is related to the transaction that closed in December 2017. Additional information regarding these strategic transactions is included in the 2017 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report. Wireline Service and Product Offerings We organize our service and product offerings by the primary customer groups targeted by these offerings - Consumer Markets, Enterprise Solutions, Partner Solutions and Business Markets. Consumer Markets Consumer Markets provides residential fixed connectivity solutions including Internet, TV, and voice services. We provide these services over our 100% fiber-optic network under the brand \"Fios\" and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. In 2017, Consumer Markets revenues were $12.8 billion, representing approximately 42% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. Internet serv ices. We offer our Fios customers fast and reliable 100% fiber-optic internet connectivity. As customers connect more devices in their home and stream more high definition video, the need for a fast and reliable internet connection is growing. In 2017, we introduced our Gigabit Connection in the marketplace, offering speeds of up to 940 Mbps on download and 880 Mbps on upload. As additional cloud-based applications are introduced, we believe that customers will place an increasing value on upstream bandwidth performance that matches what they already receive for download. In other areas of our footprint where Fios service is not available, we offer high speed Internet (HSI) using Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technology. Video services. We offer video service over our fiber-optic network. As of December 31, 2017, Fios video services were available to approximately 14 million homes across 9 states, as well as the District of Columbia.

Voice services include local exchange, regional, long distance and toll-free calling along with voice messaging services, conferencing and contact center solutions. Core data includes private line and data access networks. Core services also include the provision of customer premises equipment, and installation, maintenance and site services. We continue to transition customers out of copper-based legacy voice and data services to fiber services, including IP and Ethernet. ##TABLE_END Partner Solutions Partner Solutions provides communications services including data, voice, local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local, long distance, and wireless carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers. In 2017, Partner Solutions revenues were $4.9 billion, representing approximately 16% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. A portion of Partner Solutions revenues are generated by a few large telecommunications companies, most of which compete directly with us. Partner Solutions provides the following key services to both Wireless and Wireline carriers: ##TABLE_START  Data services. We offer a robust portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance our wholesale customers networks and provide connections to their end-users and subscribers. Our data services include high-speed digital data offerings, such as Ethernet and Wavelength services, as well as core time-division multiplexing (TDM) data circuits, such as DS1s and DS3s. In addition, we receive revenue from data services that is generated from carriers that buy dedicated local exchange capacity to support their private networks. We have also launched a dark fiber product for wireless carriers as demand for wireless data continues to grow and dark fiber plays a larger role in their network architecture. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Voice services. We provide switched access services that allow carriers to complete their end-user calls that originate or terminate within our territory. In addition, we provide originating and terminating voice services throughout the U.S. and globally utilizing our TDM and VoIP networks. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Local services. We offer an array of local dial tone and broadband services to competitive local exchange carriers, some of which are offered to comply with telecommunications regulations. In addition, we offer services such as colocation, resale and unbundled network elements in compliance with applicable regulations. ##TABLE_END Business Markets Business Markets offers tailored voice and networking products, Fios services, IP Networking, advanced voice solutions, security, and managed information technology (IT) services to U.S.-based small and medium businesses, state and local governments, and educational institutions. In 2017, Business Markets revenues were $3.6 billion, representing approximately 12% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. In addition to the traditional voice and networking products and Fios services noted in the Consumer Markets section above, Business Markets also offers traditional circuit-based network products and services, advanced networking solutions, advanced communications services, and security services, as noted in the Enterprise Solutions section above. Network Verizon operates a large and advanced telecommunications network in the U.S. and around the world to provide services and solutions to its customers. With the advancement of our Intelligent Edge Network; we are evolving our network architecture around a multi-use common fiber platform that will support both our wireless and wireline technologies and will, we believe, drive even greater levels of cost efficiency. We expect that the new architecture will improve our 4G LTE coverage, speed the deployment of 5G technology, deliver high-speed Fios broadband to homes and businesses, and create new enterprise opportunities in the business market. ##TABLE_START  Fios. Our fiber-to-the-home network through which we provide our Fios residential broadband service has passed over 17.3 million premises in the U.S. as of December 31, 2017. Residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that demand will continue to grow. The continued emergence of new video services, new data applications and the proliferation of IP devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements for increased data speeds and throughput. We believe that the Passive Optical Network (PON) technology underpinning Fios makes us well positioned to meet these demands in a cost-effective and efficient manner. Our PON technology provides the flexibility to adapt our network to deliver increased data speeds and new services without major overhauls or replacements to the fiber-optic infrastructure. ##TABLE_END While deployed initially as a consumer broadband network, the PON infrastructure is also finding more widespread application in the enterprise sector, especially as businesses increasingly migrate to Ethernet-based access services. ##TABLE_START  Global IP . Verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiber networks in the world, providing connectivity to business customers in more than 150 countries. Our global IP network includes long-haul, metro and submarine assets that span over 900,000 route miles and enable and support far reaching international operations. ##TABLE_END Global business is rapidly evolving to an \"everything-as-a-service\" model in which business customers seek cloud-based, converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services. With the continued deployment of packet optical transport strategy, Verizon is creating a single, high-capacity global network platform that combines optical transport with advanced packet switching technology. The result is a global IP network that can offer powerful solutions to these service demands. We believe that our continued focus on enhancing our domestic and global fiber-based networks, and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology deployments, will help Verizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential, small to medium business, Government and enterprise customers. Competition The wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify further with traditional, non-traditional and emerging players seeking increased market share. Current and potential competitors include cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, Internet service providers, over the top providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions.  In addition, companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth. We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry: ##TABLE_START  Bandwidth (speed) and network reliability.  Consumers and small business customers are seeking to leverage fast and reliable connections for entertainment, communications and productivity. As online and online-enabled activities increase, so will bandwidth requirements, both downstream and upstream. To succeed, we and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing bandwidth requirements.  In addition, network reliability and security are increasingly important competitive factors for our Enterprise Solutions and Business Markets customers, which include State, Local and Education (SLED), and Small and Medium Business (SMB) customers. We continue to invest in our network to be able to meet growing bandwidth demand and provide reliable and secure networks. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Pricing. Cable operators, telecommunications companies and integrated service providers use pricing to capture market share from incumbents. Pricing is also a significant factor as non-traditional modes of providing communication services emerge and new entrants compete for customers. For example, VoIP and portal-based calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Customer service. Customers expect industry-leading service from their service providers. As technologies and services evolve, the ability to excel in this area is important for customer acquisition and retention. For our Consumer Markets and Business Markets customers, we compete in this area through our service representatives and online support. We provide our Enterprise Solutions customers with ready access to their system and performance information and we conduct proactive testing of our network to identify issues before they affect their customers. In the Partner Solutions business, we believe service improvement can be achieved through continued system automation initiatives. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Product differentiation. As a result of pricing pressures, providers need to differentiate their products and services. Customers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband and video connections. Converged features, such as integrated wireless and wireline functionality, are becoming similarly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Innovation. The delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating. To compete effectively, providers need to continuously review, improve and refine their product portfolio and customer service experience and develop and rapidly deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of the customer. ##TABLE_END In the Consumer Markets business, cable operators are significant competitors. Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to deliver digital products and services. We continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include Fios Internet, TV, and voice services. In addition, in 2017 we introduced market offers targeted to our Verizon Wireless customers. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. Customers have more choices for obtaining video content from various online services and that content can be accessed on a TV, computer, tablet or mobile phone. We expect the market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to over the top offerings. We expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable companies and other providers of VoIP services as well as Internet portal providers. In the Enterprise Solutions market, competition remains intense, primarily as a result of increased industry focus on technology convergence. We compete in this area with system integrators, carriers and hardware and software providers. In addition, some of the biggest companies in IT services are making strategic acquisitions, divesting non-strategic assets or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending. Many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields, such as cloud computing, software delivery, communication applications and other computing tasks via the network, rather than on in-house machines. Carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major IT outsourcers. In the Partner Solutions business, we serve as a global wholesale partner that connects customers to the digital world. Partner Solutions competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity. In Business Markets, customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve. Solution speed and simplicity with a consumer-like \"look and feel\" are becoming key differentiators for both our SMB and SLED customers. SMB customers are seeking full life-cycle offers that radically simplify the process of starting, running and growing their businesses, while SLED customers want similar services that are high quality and secure that enable material improvement in citizen outreach, public safety and city infrastructure performance, all of which help attract inward investment and community prosperity. ##TABLE_START Media and Telematics ##TABLE_ENDTechnology developments, interconnected markets, shifting consumer needs and converging industry ecosystems are creating innovative opportunities for Verizon. We are transforming around the capabilities of our high-performing networks, with a goal of future growth based on delivering what customers want and need in the new digital world. Our three tier strategy is to lead at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, develop new business models through global platforms in digital media and IoT, and deliver solutions to key industry segments for incremental monetization. Verizon is focused on leveraging all of our assets to create innovative products and services that can provide our customers with integrated solutions that address their needs. Several strategic initiatives have been undertaken by Verizon in the areas of digital media, interactive entertainment and IoT (including telematics) products and services. Media Verizon has been investing in emerging technology that taps into the market shift to digital content and advertising. We have been investing in video assets and capabilities with a goal of building a global platform and developing new business models for reaching the digital video customer. We believe the growth in video consumption using mobile devices provides us with an opportunity for revenue growth. Through various acquisitions and investments and the launch of video streaming products and services, we are expanding the ways in which we can deliver content to our customers, including the following: ##TABLE_START  In June 2015, we completed our acquisition of AOL Inc. (AOL), a leader in digital content and advertising. AOLs business model aligns with our approach, and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a digital advertising platform enhances our ability to further develop future revenue streams. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  In June 2017, we completed our acquisition of the operating business of Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo), a leader in search, communications, digital content and advertising. Yahoo informs, connects and entertains through its search, communications and digital content products. Yahoo also connects advertisers with target audiences through a streamlined advertising technology stack that utilizes a combination of data, content and technology. Verizon has combined Yahoo's operating business with our existing Media business, which included AOL's operations and the content delivery platform of Verizon Digital Media Services (VDMS), to create a new organization named Oath, which ##TABLE_ENDincludes diverse media and technology brands that engage approximately a billion people around the world. We believe that Oath, with its technology, content and data, will help us expand the global scale of our digital media business and build brands for the future. Additional discussion of the transaction is included in the 2017 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_START  We continue to invest in VDMS, which offers a scalable platform for delivering content, including live broadcasts, video on demand, games, software and websites, to our customers on their devices at any time. As the digital platform reshapes the delivery of media and entertainment content, there is an increasing need for a stable, high-quality video delivery platform. We are focused on providing a simple end-to-end global platform for the delivery of media to consumers, which we believe will be superior to that offered by the existing and highly fragmented media delivery ecosystem. This platform is targeted at media and entertainment companies and other businesses focused on delivering their digital products and services through the Internet. We also expect, through the VDMS platform, to support video initiatives and offerings, such as Fios and wireless, across the business. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  We have established relationships with leading sports leagues to bring compelling content to our customers across our digital platforms. We recently announced a multi-year partnership with the National Football League (NFL) in which Verizons portfolio of premium digital and mobile media properties, such as Yahoo Sports, will stream in-market and national games, including national pre-season, regular season and playoff games, and the Super Bowl to mobile phones. We also recently announced an innovative, multi-year partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA) that will deliver one of the most comprehensive video streaming offerings of NBA content - from live out-of-market games via NBA League Pass to highlights, fantasy basketball, original programming and more via Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Fantasy and across Verizons family of media brands. As part of the partnership, the NBA and Verizon will unveil a series of innovative collaborations leveraging Verizon's leading network and technology to deliver premium NBA content and unique fan experiences. Verizon also has rights to deliver leading soccer games, including La Liga and Liga MX, to its customers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  We have made investments in converging technologies and services involving content delivery networks (CDNs), video streaming and related consumer hardware to leverage new content models. Our wireless network enables us to move towards a unified video strategy that positions us to take advantage of this growth opportunity. We began using Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) technology to develop our LTE Multicast service. MBMS has the potential to enhance our network efficiency and provide our customers with access to live streaming video content with virtually no buffering, regardless of the number of devices using the service. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  During 2016, we established Verizon Hearst Media Partners, LLC, a content joint venture with Hearst Entertainment  Syndication (Hearst), to build new multiplatform digital video channels targeted to the mobile millennial audience. In partnership with Hearst, we have also invested in two media companies, AwesomenessTV Holdings, LLC and Complex Media, Inc., which are leaders in producing content targeted at key demographics, in order to further diversify our content and distribution businesses within our digital media portfolio. ##TABLE_END Internet of Things and Telematics The adoption of IoT technology continues to grow as companies across a wide range of industries are leveraging IoT technologies to increase efficiency, gain better customer insights, facilitate compliance and build new business models. IoT growth is expanding broadly, and adoption is particularly strong in the telematics and transportation industries in addition to the fields of smart communities, healthcare, utilities and energy management. We are building IoT capabilities by leveraging business models that monetize usage on our network at the connectivity, platform and solution layers. We have developed IoT solutions that address key market needs for electric and other utilities, farms and other purveyors of food and agriculture, drug companies and others with complex supply chains. In addition, our IoT customers can turn the data that our solutions provide into actionable opportunities to develop new services and create revenue growth. Our IoT services offer end-to-end solutions for various IoT vertical markets, such as: ##TABLE_START  Fleet management and telematics. We provide in-vehicle solutions that enable vehicle navigation, GPS tracking, engine diagnostic monitoring and maintenance alerts; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Energy. We offer solutions targeted to providing the energy sector with greater visibility into energy usage and the ability to remotely monitor devices used to track energy usage; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Smart Communities. Our solutions enable localities to collect data from IoT and connected machine technologies with the goal of improving public safety, managing traffic, reducing pollution, identifying revenue generation opportunities, making efficient use of limited resources and attracting businesses, residents and workers. ##TABLE_END Through Verizon Telematics, we are automating, and helping our customers to optimize, the way people, vehicles and things move through the world. Our telematics business offers a full array of solutions to both businesses and consumers that combine location-based software, services and data intelligence. We enable our customers to track, safeguard and optimize their most prized assets: people, vehicles, equipment and data. Through organic and inorganic growth, Verizon has built one of the largest telematics businesses worldwide based on its advanced mobile telematics platforms. Our consumer offering is anchored by our Hum product. Hum is an aftermarket vehicle technology and subscription service that provides consumers with diagnostic technology in their vehicles, access to live assistance and roadside assistance with GPS accuracy when needed. Our Hum service also offers the ability to connect with a certified mechanic to diagnose potential problems and offer solutions. Since its market introduction in 2015, Hum has grown rapidly, becoming one of the largest consumer telematics platforms in North America. We also offer consumer telematics services via automotive OEMs such as Mercedes Benz, Volkswagen and others in select markets. Verizon Telematics has also developed one of the largest commercial telematics businesses worldwide. In addition to our Networkfleet business, in 2016 we acquired both Fleetmatics Group PLC, a global provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions, and Telogis, Inc., a global, cloud-based mobile enterprise management software business. With these combined businesses, Verizon Telematics is a top commercial telematics provider globally. We serve both the enterprise and SMB market segments with advanced solutions and scale in distribution, research and development, and customer support. ##TABLE_START Patents, Trademarks and Licenses ##TABLE_ENDWe own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad. We also actively grant licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable the licensees to take advantage of the results of Verizons research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to us, we do not believe that the loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations. We periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, or cease offering the relevant products or services. ##TABLE_START Acquisitions and Divestitures ##TABLE_ENDInformation about our acquisitions and divestitures is included in the 2017 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners under the heading \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Acquisitions and Divestitures\" and in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report. ##TABLE_START Regulatory and Competitive Trends ##TABLE_ENDRegulatory and Competitive Landscape Verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market. Current and potential competitors include other voice and data service providers such as other wireless companies, traditional telephone companies, cable companies, Internet service providers, software and application providers, and other non-traditional companies. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth. Some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator. The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act or Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation. Federal Regulation Wireless Services The FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. Verizon anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. We can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential conditions. Today, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizons wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers, including construction and geographic coverage requirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 services, roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities. Broadband Verizon offers many different broadband services. Traditionally, the FCC recognized broadband Internet access services as \"information services\" subject to a \"light touch\" regulatory approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-style regulations. In 2015, the FCC declared that broadband Internet access services are \"telecommunications services\" subject to common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. In December 2017, the FCC adopted an order reversing the 2015 Title II Order to return to \"light touch\" regulation of broadband Internet access services. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains committed to the open Internet, which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want, and our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at http://responsibility.verizon.com/broadband-commitment. Wireline Voice Verizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be \"common carrier\" services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements. Video Verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has typically been required to obtain a franchise from local authorities. Privacy and Data Security We are subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business, including wireline, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in the media and IoT space. At the federal level, our voice business is subject to the FCC's privacy requirements. Oversight of broadband Internet access privacy and data security, which had shifted from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to the FCC following the FCC's adoption of its 2015 Title II Order, will return to the FTC as a result of the FCC's repeal of the 2015 Title II Order in December 2017. Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at both the state and federal level. In addition, a new data protection regulation will go into effect in Europe in May 2018 that includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Public Safety and Cybersecurity The FCC has played a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread availability of both media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks that have occurred or could occur in the future, however, the FCC or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers. Intercarrier Compensation and Network Access The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline \"business data services\" and other services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both makes and receives interconnection payments. In April 2017, the FCC issued an order, which is currently under appeal, that revised the regulatory structure for business data services, eliminating tariffing obligations and ex ante price regulations in markets the FCC determined to be competitive. The FCC has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates, terms and conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for business data services may be appropriate. State Regulation and Local Regulation Wireless Services The Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does not prohibit states from regulating the other \"terms and conditions\" of wireless service. For example, some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose reporting requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving) and taxation matters. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process. Wireline Services State public utility commissions regulate Verizons telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as an \"incumbent local exchange carrier\" in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated. In addition, as a video services operator in many states, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations, as a result. ##TABLE_START Environmental Matters ##TABLE_ENDReserves have been established to cover environmental matters relating to discontinued businesses and past telecommunications activities. These reserves include funds to address contamination at the site of a former Sylvania facility in Hicksville, NY, which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. In September 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken primary responsibility for addressing the contamination at the site. An adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to the past and future expenses of all of the parties. Adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites requiring remediation. ##TABLE_START Executive Officers ##TABLE_ENDSee Part III, Item 10. \"Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our executive officers. ##TABLE_START Employees ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2017 , Verizon and its subsidiaries had approximately 155,400 employees.

The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the U.S. or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services, dropping down in price plans or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. Similarly, under these conditions, the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We face significant competition that may reduce our profits. We face significant competition in our industry. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, Internet, local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, application and device providers and providers of VoIP services. While these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. In addition, wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided  in some cases specifically targeting Verizon Wireless customers. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits. If we are not able to adapt to changes and disruptions in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits. Our industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services. If our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. In addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services. We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as fiber, switch and network equipment, smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. For example, our smartphone and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices. If these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers. We also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. Because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry. We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology. Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified products or services. We are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. New laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks and operate our Media and Telematics businesses, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. For example, we are subject to federal, state and international laws related to privacy and data protection. A new data protection regulation will go into effect in Europe in May 2018 that includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In an order adopted by the FCC in December 2017, the FCC repealed its 2015 Title II Order that had nullified its longstanding \"light touch\" approach to regulating broadband Internet access services and \"reclassified\" these services as telecommunications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation. The December 2017 order could be appealed or otherwise challenged. The outcome and timing of any such appeal or challenge remains uncertain. In addition, we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. Moreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services. The further regulation of broadband, wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks. Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks, including through the use of malware, computer viruses, dedicated denial of services attacks, credential harvesting, social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers operations. Cyber attacks against companies, including Verizon, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. Further, the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. These attacks may be committed by company employees or external actors operating in any geography, including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective, and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states. Cyber attacks may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks, especially where disruption of service is an objective of the attacker. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to Verizon's operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future. The inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses to Verizon and/or a loss of market share to other communications providers. The costs associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. The potential costs associated with these attacks could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Further, certain of Verizons businesses, such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. Moreover, our increasing presence in the IoT industry with offerings of telematics products and services, including vehicle telematics, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services. In addition, a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information, such as financial data and sensitive or private personal information, could result in lawsuits and government claims, investigations or proceedings. Any of these occurrences could damage our reputation, adversely impact customer and investor confidence, and could further result in a material adverse effect on Verizons results of operation or financial condition. Natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. A natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. In addition, these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation. Verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if Verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt. As of December 31, 2017 , Verizon had approximately $108.2 billion of outstanding unsecured indebtedness, as well as approximately $8.9 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facility. Verizons debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: ##TABLE_START  requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt and the preferred stock issued by an entity acquired in a transaction with Vodafone, which would reduce the funds Verizon has available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  making it more difficult or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  reducing Verizons flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industry and market conditions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  making Verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  exposing Verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that its debt obligations are at variable interest rates. ##TABLE_END Adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing. Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. With approximately 155,400 employees and approximately 197,000 retirees as of December 31, 2017 eligible to participate in Verizons benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, including the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding the potential repeal and replacement or modification of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts. As of December 31, 2017 , approximately 23% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. While we have labor contracts in place with these unions, with subsequent negotiations we could incur additional costs and/or experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations. In addition, while less than 1% of the workforce of our wireless and other businesses outside of wireline is represented by unions, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in further organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our operations. We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Legal Proceedings ##TABLE_ENDIn October 2013, the California Attorney Generals Office notified certain Verizon companies of potential violations of California state hazardous waste statutes primarily arising from the disposal of electronic components, batteries and aerosol cans at certain California facilities. We are cooperating with this investigation and continue to review our operations relating to the management of hazardous waste. While penalties relating to the alleged violations could exceed $100,000, we do not expect that any penalties ultimately incurred will be material. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " Item 4.

The new program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, or at the close of business on February 28, 2020, whichever is sooner. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated transactions and on the open market, including through plans complying with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The timing and number of shares purchased under the program, if any, will depend on market conditions and the Companys capital allocation priorities. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , Verizon did no t repurchase any shares of Verizons common stock under our authorized share buyback programs.

Business ##TABLE_ENDGeneral Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the worlds leading providers of communications, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies. With a presence around the world, we offer voice, data and video services and solutions on our networks that are designed to meet customers demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. Formerly known as Bell Atlantic Corporation (Bell Atlantic), we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We began doing business as Verizon on June 30, 2000 following our merger with GTE Corporation. We have a highly diverse workforce of approximately  144,500  employees . Our principal executive offices are located at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036 (telephone number 212-395-1000). We have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business units and organize by products and services, and customer groups, respectively. ##TABLE_START Wireless Wireless communications products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided to consumer, business and government customers across the United States (U.S.). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Wireline Wirelines communications products and enhanced services include video and data services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services.

We are modifying our internal and external reporting processes, systems and internal controls to accommodate the new structure and expect to transition to the new segment reporting structure during the second quarter of 2019. We continue to report operating results to our chief operating decision maker under our current operating segments. Additional discussion of our reportable segments is included in the 2018 Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders under the headings \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview and - Segment Results of Operations\" and in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries, which are incorporated by reference into this report. Wireless Background Our Wireless segment, doing business as Verizon Wireless, provides wireless communications products and services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the  U.S. Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless service provider in the U.S. as measured by retail connections and revenue. At December 31, 2018 , Verizon Wireless had 118.0 million retail connections and 2018 revenues of approximately $91.7 billion , representing approximately 70% of Verizons aggregate revenues. Cellco Partnership (Cellco), which originally held the wireless assets of Bell Atlantic, began operating as \"Verizon Wireless\" in April 2000 with both Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone) and Bell Atlantic as partners, following Vodafones contribution of its U.S. wireless assets into Cellco. We acquired all of Vodafones indirect 45% interest in Verizon Wireless in 2014, which resulted in full ownership of Verizon Wireless. Wireless Service and Product Offerings Our wireless services are available to our customers receiving service under the Verizon Wireless brand, customers that obtain wireless products and services that operate on our network from resellers that purchase network access from us on a wholesale basis and customers that utilize Internet of Things (IoT) services via our network. Wireless Services We offer our customers a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of devices. Customers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Retail (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts primarily represent retail customers with Verizon Wireless that are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and use its branded services. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. A retail postpaid connection represents an individual line of service for a wireless device for which a customer is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. Approximately 96% of our total retail connections were postpaid connections as of December 31, 2018 . Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance.  We offer various postpaid account service plans, including unlimited plans, shared data plans, single connection plans and other plans tailored to the needs of our customers. Our unlimited plans, available to our consumer and business customers, offer, among other things, unlimited domestic voice, data and texting. Our unlimited plans allow customers to mix and match plans by line, with different benefits and inclusions beyond just traditional data access, voice and text. Our shared data plans typically feature unlimited domestic voice, unlimited domestic and international text, video and picture messaging, and a single data allowance that can be shared among the wireless devices on a customers account. This allowance will vary from time to time as part of promotional offers or in response to market circumstances. Customers on certain fixed-data plans may carry over unused data allowances to the next billing period, or stay online at a reduced data speed after using all of a data allowance for a billing period. Our unlimited and shared data plans include High Definition (HD) Voice and Video Calling on compatible devices, and certain plans offer additional services, such as Mobile Hotspot services and free roaming in Canada and Mexico on compatible devices. Our HD Voice services, enabled by Voice over LTE (VoLTE), deliver calls over our fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network, and our Video Calling service combines an HD Voice call with real-time video. Our Mobile Hotspot service enables a customer to activate a personal Wi-Fi hotspot that can provide Internet access to multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices. Our unlimited plans provide customers the ability to stream DVD or HD quality videos, based on the service plan. We also offer various voice and shared data plans for business customers. As of January 2017, we no longer offer consumers new fixed-term subsidized service plans for phones; however, we continue to offer subsidized plans to our business customers, and we also continue to service existing fixed-term subsidized plans for consumers who have not yet purchased and activated devices under the Verizon device payment program. We also offer prepaid connection service plans that feature domestic unlimited voice and unlimited domestic and international text. We have both single line and multi-line family options, with individual line data plan selections ranging from 500 megabytes per month to unlimited data. Family prepaid accounts include a line discount based on the number of total lines. On compatible devices, our prepaid plans also feature video and picture messaging, HD Voice and Video Calling. Our metered prepaid plans include Mobile Hotspot services and allow customers to continue to access our data services at reduced data speeds after using their monthly allowance for 4G LTE high speed data. None of our prepaid plans require an annual contract or credit check. Our international travel wireless services allow our customers to access voice, text and data services on many of our \"World\" smartphones, tablets or basic phones from various international destinations, dependent upon the customer's wireless plan. With TravelPass, customers are able to use their domestic talk, text and data allowances while traveling in Mexico, Canada and other countries where TravelPass is available for a flat rate per day. Access to the Internet is available on all smartphones and nearly all basic phones. In addition, our customers can access the Internet at broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets that are either wireless enabled or that are used in conjunction with separate dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection. We also provide network access needed to deliver various IoT products and services. We work with various companies that purchase network access from us to connect their Open Development certified devices, bundled together with their own solutions, which they sell to end-users. Wireless Equipment We offer several categories of wireless equipment, including a variety of smartphone and other handsets, wireless-enabled Internet devices, such as tablets, laptop computers and netbooks and other wireless enabled connected devices, such as smart watches and other wearables, and our Hum product. Distribution We use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels to market and distribute our products and services. Our direct channel includes our business-to-business sales operations and systems organization and is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of consumers and local, regional and national business customers. Company-operated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy. Our \"Next Gen Design\" retail stores focus on our customer's evolving digital lifestyle. Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the U.S., as well as through the Internet. The majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us. We also have relationships with high-profile national retailers, which sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services, and with various convenience store chains, which sell our prepaid products and services. Competition We operate in a highly competitive industry. We compete against other national wireless service providers, including ATT Inc., Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile USA, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers for resale, including resellers that buy from us. Competition remains intense as a result of high rates of smartphone penetration in the wireless market, increased network investment by our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, the introduction of new products and services, offerings that include additional premium content, new market entrants, the availability of additional spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes. Competition may also increase as smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service providers and as mobile virtual network operators resell wireless communication services. The wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Google Inc., Apple Inc. and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless providers voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry: ##TABLE_START  Network reliability, capacity and coverage. We consider a wireless network that consistently provides high-quality and reliable service to be a key differentiator in the U.S. market and driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new wireless service offerings, which in many cases include video content, have led to increased customer usage of wireless services, which, in turn, puts pressure on network capacity. In order to compete effectively, wireless service providers must keep pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through their networks. We believe that the depth and breadth of our network provides our fundamental strength and is the basis for our competitive advantage in the wireless marketplace. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Pricing. Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape, with plans that address both the postpaid and prepaid customer. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, we and other wireless service providers are offering service plans at competitive prices that include voice services, data access and text messaging, in some cases on an unlimited basis. Many other wireless service providers have also bundled wireless service offerings with other products while others offer promotional pricing and incentives targeted specifically to customers of Verizon Wireless. We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, also offer device payment options, which provide consumers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and device leasing arrangements. In addition, aggressive device promotions have also become more common in a highly penetrated market in order to gain share of subscribers interested in changing carriers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Customer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers, including those of other wireless providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and focusing on their needs in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. To promote long-term relationships with our customers, we launched the Verizon Up program, which offers a variety of rewards to customers in exchange for points they earn in connection with their account-related transactions with Verizon Wireless. The program offers customers discounts on products, services and access to experiences, such as sporting events, shows and concerts. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Product and service development. As wireless technologies develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate, continued customer and revenue growth will be increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced data products and services. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative wireless products and services both independently and in collaboration with application and content providers. We also collaborate with various device manufacturers in the development of distinctive smartphones and other wireless devices that can access the growing array of data applications and content available over the Internet. We continue to focus on increasing the penetration of smartphones, tablets and other connected devices throughout our customer base. In addition, as the price for smartphones has continued to increase in the market, our device protection services have grown in importance for consumers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Sales and distribution. A key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We believe that attaining the optimal combination of varying distribution channels is important to achieving industry-leading profitability, as measured by operating income. We strive to increase sales through our company-operated stores, outside sales teams and telemarketing, web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations, and through manufacturers of laptops and netbooks that can access the Internet on our network at broadband speeds. In addition, we sell network access to both traditional resellers, which resell network services to their end-users , and to various companies to enable wireless communications for their IoT devices or services. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Capital resources. In order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services, wireless service providers require significant capital resources. We generate significant cash flow from operations to enable continued investment. ##TABLE_END Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry. These include the factors described above, as well as new technologies, new business models, changes in customer preferences, regulatory changes, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies that bundle the services of wireless and cable competitors. Strategic Transaction During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300  of our wireless towers and corresponding ground leases for an upfront payment of  $5.0 billion . We have subleased capacity on the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10  years at current market rates, with options to renew. Under the terms of the lease agreements, American Tower has exclusive rights to lease and operate towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, American Tower has fixed-price purchase options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. As part of this transaction, we also sold 162 towers for $0.1 billion. See \"Network and Technology - Spectrum\" for additional information regarding the NextLink Wireless LLC (NextLink) and Straight Path Communications Inc. (Straight Path) strategic transactions related to the Wireless segment. Wireline Background Our Wireline segment provides communications products and enhanced services, including video and data services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the U.S. and around the world. In 2018 , Wireline revenues were $29.8 billion , representing approximately 23% of Verizons aggregate revenues. To compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products (such as voice services), we continue to build our Wireline business around a fiber-based network supporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. We continue to seek ways to increase revenue, further realize operating and capital efficiencies and maximize profitability across the segment. We are reinventing our network architecture around a common fiber platform that will support both our wireless and wireline businesses. We expect our \"multi-use fiber\" Intelligent Edge Network initiative will create opportunities to generate revenue from fiber-based services in our Wireline business.  Wireline Service and Product Offerings We organize our service and product offerings by the primary customer groups targeted by these offerings - Consumer Markets, Enterprise Solutions, Partner Solutions and Business Markets. Consumer Markets Consumer Markets provides residential fixed connectivity solutions, including Internet, TV and voice services. We provide these services over our 100% fiber-optic network under the brand \"Fios\" and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. In 2018 , Consumer Markets revenues were $12.6 billion , representing approximately 42% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. Internet serv ices. We offer our Fios customers fast and reliable 100% fiber-optic Internet connectivity. As customers connect more devices in their home and stream more high definition video, the need for a fast and reliable Internet connection is growing. In 2017, we introduced our Gigabit Connection in the marketplace, offering speeds of up to 940 Mbps on download and 880 Mbps on upload. As additional cloud-based applications are introduced, we believe that customers will place an increasing value on upstream bandwidth performance that matches what they already receive for download. In other areas of our footprint where Fios service is not available, we offer high speed Internet (HSI) using Digital Subscriber Line technology. Video services. We offer video service over our fiber-optic network. As of December 31, 2018 , Fios video services were available to homes across 9 states, as well as the District of Columbia. We have several offerings available to our Fios TV customers, including ##TABLE_START  Fios Custom TV, which provides customers with seven distinct package offerings. Each package includes the local versions of the major broadcast stations and other similar local content and then adds on more than 45 specialty channels driven by popular viewership choices; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Fios Traditional TV, which provides customers with a variety of package offerings.

Business Markets Business Markets offers tailored voice and networking products, Fios services, IP Networking, advanced voice solutions, security, and managed information technology (IT) services to U.S.-based small and medium businesses, state and local governments, and educational institutions. In 2018 , Business Markets revenues were $3.4 billion , representing approximately 11% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. In addition to the traditional voice and networking products and Fios services noted in the Consumer Markets section above, Business Markets also offers traditional circuit-based network products and services, advanced networking solutions, advanced communications services, and security services, as noted in the Enterprise Solutions section above. Competition The wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify further with traditional and non-traditional participants seeking increased market share. Current and potential competitors include cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, Internet service providers, over-the-top providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions.  In addition, companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth.  We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry: ##TABLE_START  Bandwidth (speed) and network reliability.  Consumers and small business customers seek fast and reliable connections for entertainment, communications and productivity. As Internet use increases, so do bandwidth requirements, both downstream and upstream. We and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing bandwidth requirements. In addition, network reliability and security are increasingly important competitive factors for our Enterprise Solutions and Business Markets customers, which include state and local government and education (SLED) customers and small and medium business (SMB) customers. We continue to invest in our network to be able to meet growing bandwidth demand and provide reliable and secure networks. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Pricing. Cable operators, telecommunications companies and integrated service providers use pricing to capture market share from incumbents. Pricing is also a significant factor as non-traditional modes of providing communication services emerge and new entrants compete for customers. For example, VoIP and portal-based voice and video calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Customer service. Customers expect industry-leading service from their service providers. As technologies and services evolve, the ability to excel in this area is important for customer acquisition and retention. For our Consumer Markets and Business Markets customers, we compete in this area through our service representatives and online support. We provide our Enterprise Solutions customers with ready access to their system and performance information and we conduct proactive testing of our network to identify issues before they affect their customers. In our Partner Solutions business, service improvement is achieved through continued system automation initiatives. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Product differentiation. As a result of pricing pressures, providers need to differentiate their products and services. Customers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband and video connections. Converged features, such as integrated wireless and wireline functionality, are becoming similarly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Innovation. The delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating. To compete effectively, providers need to continuously review, improve and refine their product portfolio and customer service experience and develop and rapidly deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of customers. ##TABLE_END In the Consumer Markets business, cable operators are significant competitors. Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to deliver digital products and services. We continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include Fios Internet, TV, and voice services and we have introduced market offers targeted to our Verizon Wireless customers. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. Customers have more choices for obtaining video content from various online services and that content can be accessed on a TV, computer, tablet or mobile phone. We expect the market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings. We expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their services as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable operators and other providers of VoIP services as well as Internet portal providers. In the Enterprise Solutions market, competition remains high, primarily as a result of increased industry focus on technology convergence. We compete in this area with system integrators, carriers, and hardware and software providers. In addition, some of the largest IT services companies are making strategic acquisitions, divesting non-strategic assets or forging new alliances to improve cost structure and focus on solutions which are growth catalysts for technology spending. Many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields, such as cloud computing, software delivery, communication applications and other computing tasks via the network, rather than by the use of in-house machines. Carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major IT outsourcers. Our Partner Solutions business competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity. In Business Markets, customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve. Solution speed and simplicity with a consumer-like \"look and feel\" are becoming key differentiators for both our SMB and SLED customers. SMB customers are seeking full life-cycle offers that simplify the process of starting, running and growing their businesses, while SLED customers want similar services that are high quality and secure, and that enable material improvement in citizen outreach, public safety and city infrastructure performance. Strategic Transactions In April 2016, we completed the sale (Access Line Sale) of our local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states to Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.3 billion net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier. The transaction, which included the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizons incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and Texas, did not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The transaction resulted in Frontier acquiring approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios video subscribers and the related ILEC businesses from Verizon. Approximately 9,300 Verizon employees who served customers in California, Florida and Texas continued employment with Frontier. In December 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2017, with Equinix , Inc. (Equinix)  pursuant to which we agreed to sell 23  customer-facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin America for approximately  $3.6 billion , subject to certain adjustments (Data Center Sale) . The transaction closed in May 2017. In February 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire  XO Holdings' wireline business ( XO ) , which owned and operated one of the largest fiber-based IP and Ethernet networks in the U.S. Concurrently, we entered into a separate agreement to utilize certain wireless spectrum from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO Holdings,  NextLink , that held its wireless spectrum. The agreement included an option, subject to certain conditions, to buy NextLink. In February 2017, we completed our acquisition of XO for total cash consideration of approximately  $1.5 billion , of which  $0.1 billion was paid in 2015. In April 2017, we exercised our option to buy NextLink for approximately  $0.5 billion , subject to certain adjustments, of which  $0.3 billion  was prepaid in the first quarter of 2017. The transaction closed in January 2018. The acquisition of NextLink was accounted for as an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the value related to the acquired spectrum. Upon closing, we recorded approximately $0.7 billion  of wireless licenses, $0.1 billion  of a deferred tax liability and  $0.1 billion  of other liabilities. The spectrum acquired as part of the transaction will be used for our 5G technology deployment . In August 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase certain fiber-optic network assets in the Chicago market from  WideOpenWest, Inc. ( WOW! ) , a leading provider of communications services. The transaction closed in December 2017. In addition, the parties entered into a separate agreement pursuant to which WOW! will complete the build-out of the network assets in 2019. The total cash consideration for the transactions is approximately  $0.3 billion , of which  $0.2 billion  was received in December 2017. Additional information regarding these strategic transactions is included in the 2018 Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report. Network and Technology Wireless Our primary network technology platform is 4G LTE, which provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3G technologies. In addition, over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services.  Our 4G LTE network is available in approximately 500 markets covering approximately 331 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. Under this program, we have collaborated with wireless carriers in rural areas to build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carriers network assets and our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 megahertz (MHz) C Block and Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum. We currently have 21 LTE in Rural America partners that provide 4G LTE coverage to an area covering approximately three million people. We use HD Calling, enabled by VoLTE, in addition to 3G Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology, to provide voice calling services to our customers. We consider the reliability, coverage and speed of our wireless network as key factors for our continued success and we strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for their wireless services. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services that will fuel profitable growth. We design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions, including video, permitting the completion of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds, and also maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped. We have been densifying our 4G LTE network by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. Network densification not only enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services, but also positions us for the deployment of 5G technology . We are also utilizing existing network capabilities to handle increased traffic without interrupting the quality of the customer experience. We have and will continue to deploy advanced technologies to increase both network capacity and data rates. Our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service. To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations, we have battery backup at every switch and every macrocell in our network. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macrocells and at every switch location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed, if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant Multiprotocol Label Switching backbone network in critical locations. In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the U.S. where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the U.S. Certain of our roaming agreements can be terminated at will by either party upon several months notice; however, we do not believe that the termination of any of these at-will agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business. Spectrum The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice, video and data communications services. We are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 MHz band, also known as cellular spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum, portions of the 700 MHz upper C band and AWS 1 and 3 spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands, in areas that, collectively, cover nearly all of the population of the U.S. This spectrum is collectively called low and mid-band spectrum. In addition to our low and mid-band spectrum, we have spectrum licenses in the 28 and 39 Gigahertz (GHz) band, collectively called millimeter-wave spectrum. In 2017, we entered into transactions to acquire NextLink and Straight Path, each of which held millimeter-wave spectrum licenses. The NextLink acquisition closed in January 2018 and the Straight Path acquisition closed in February 2018. The spectrum acquired as part of these transactions is being used for our 5G technology deployment. In January 2015, the FCC completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum in the AWS-3 band. We participated in that auction and were the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. The FCC granted us these spectrum licenses in April 2015. We are aggressively refarming 3G bands on 800 MHz and PCS bands for 4G LTE use. We anticipate that we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. This increasing demand is driven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of speed, as well as the wider deployment of 5G mobile and fixed services. We can meet our future 4G and 5G spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur. On November 14, 2018, the FCC started two sequential millimeter wave auctions. Verizon is an applicant in the FCC's Auction 101 and Auction 102 relating to millimeter wave spectrum. On January 24, 2019, the FCC announced that Auction 101 had concluded with a total of approximately $702.6 million in bids received for the licenses that were won. The FCC has stated that it will not, and it will not permit any applicant to, disclose the winning bidders of any of the licenses in Auction 101 until Auction 102 concludes. In addition, the FCC has indicated that a third millimeter wave auction will begin in the second half of 2019, and the auction for Priority Access Licenses in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) 3.5 GHz band may also begin in 2019. In addition to spectrum, we believe that future demand will also be met as we increase the density of our networks and deploy advanced technologies. From time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future. In certain cases, we have entered into intra market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency. These swaps, as well as any spectrum purchases, require us to obtain governmental approvals. Additional information regarding spectrum license transactions is included in the 2018 Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report. 5G Deployment We believe 5G technology can provide users with eight capabilities, or currencies. The eight currencies are peak data rates, mobile data volumes, mobility, connected devices, energy efficiency, service deployment, latency and reliability. In late 2015, we launched the Verizon 5G Technology Forum with key industry partners to develop 5G requirements and standards and conduct testing to accelerate the introduction of 5G technologies. We expect that 5G technology will provide higher throughput than the current 4G LTE technology, lower latency and enable our network to handle more traffic as the number of Internet-connected devices grows.  During 2018, we commercially launched 5G Home, our alternative to wired home broadband, on proprietary standards in four U.S. markets; Sacramento, Los Angeles, Houston and Indianapolis. We are the first company to bring 5G broadband Internet service to consumers and we expect to expand coverage as we transition to global standards equipment in 2019. In addition, we expect to launch mobile 5G services in 2019 as compatible devices become available. Network Equipment and Build-Out As we continue to build and upgrade our existing 4G LTE network and deploy our 5G network, we must complete a variety of steps, including securing rights to a large number of sites as well as obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for both our macro and small cells. As we densify our network, we follow a similar process for small cells, in-building systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We have relationships with a wide variety of vendors that supply various products and services that support our network operations. We utilize tower site management firms as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing leased and owned tower sites. Wireline Fios Residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that demand will continue to grow. The continued emergence of new video services, new data applications and the proliferation of IP devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements for increased data speeds and throughput. We believe that the Passive Optical Network (PON) technology underpinning Fios makes us well positioned to meet these demands in a cost-effective and efficient manner. Our PON technology provides the flexibility to adapt our network to deliver increased data speeds and new services without major overhauls or replacements to the fiber-optic infrastructure. While deployed initially as a consumer broadband network, our PON infrastructure is also finding more widespread application in the enterprise sector, especially as businesses increasingly migrate to Ethernet-based access services. Global IP Verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiber networks in the world, providing connectivity to business customers in more than 150 countries. Our global IP network includes long-haul, metro and submarine assets that span over 1 million route miles and enable and support international operations. Global business is rapidly evolving to an \"everything-as-a-service\" model in which business customers seek cloud-based, converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services. With the continued deployment of packet optical transport strategy, Verizon is creating a single, high-capacity global network platform that combines optical transport with advanced packet switching technology. The result is a global IP network that can offer powerful solutions to these service demands. We believe that our continued focus on enhancing our domestic and global fiber-based networks, and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology deployments, will help Verizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential, SMB, government and enterprise customers. Intelligent Edge Network We are evolving our network architecture to a next-generation multi-use platform, providing improved efficiency, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support both our fiber-based and radio access network technologies. We call this the Intelligent Edge Network. We expect that the new network architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, improve our 4G LTE coverage, speed the deployment of 5G technology, deliver high-speed Fios broadband to homes and businesses, and create new enterprise opportunities in the business market. Media Background Verizon has been investing in emerging technology that taps into the market shift to digital content and advertising. Our Media business, Verizon Media, which operated in 2018 under the \"Oath\" brand, includes diverse media and technology brands that serve the global community using powerful technology, trusted content and differentiated data. Our strategy is built on providing consumers with owned and operated search properties and finance, news, sports and entertainment offerings and providing other businesses and partners access to consumers through digital advertising platforms. We have been investing in video assets and capabilities with a goal of building a global platform and developing new business models for reaching the digital video customer. We believe the growth in video consumption using mobile devices provides us with an opportunity for revenue growth. Through various acquisitions and investments, we are expanding the ways in which we can deliver content to our customers. Verizon Media Group Products and Solutions Ad Platform Our Verizon Media Ad Platform creates value for advertisers with a simplified suite of intelligent advertising, video and broadcast publishing solutions across all devices (desktop, mobile and television). Verizon Media's data content (i.e. finance, news, sports and entertainment), communication services and programmatic algorithms connect advertisers with their target audiences. Verizon Medias business is comprised primarily of search advertising, display advertising and subscriptions. ##TABLE_START  Search Platforms. Our search properties serve as a guide for users to discover the information on the Internet that matters to them the most. Verizon Media serves click-based search advertisements generated by proprietary algorithmic technology, as well as advertisements from partners. Verizon Media provides the underlying search products that facilitate user searches within Verizon Media and third party partner properties. In December 2018, we entered into an exclusive search advertising agreement with Microsoft whereby Verizon Media will exclusively send traffic to Microsoft in event of an ad call, commencing the first quarter of 2019. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Display Advertising. Display advertising is made up of both graphical and performance-based advertising and takes the form of impression-based contracts, time-based contracts and performance-based contracts. Verizon Media display ads leverage a comprehensive set of proprietary data signals to identify and engage the right users on Verizon Media properties and across the web. Through Verizon Media platforms, we provide advertisers the ability to programmatically buy and measure advertising across all screens and advertising formats using self-serve technology or our managed services; and to buy advertising inventory using traditional advertising sales methods. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Subscription Memberships. Our paid subscription  offerings include services such as privacy and security solutions and computer protection. ##TABLE_END Verizon Digital Media Services As the digital platform reshapes the delivery of media and entertainment content, there is an increasing need for a stable, high-quality video delivery platform. Verizon Digital Media Services (VDMS) offers a scalable platform for delivering content, including live broadcasts, video on demand, games, software and websites, to our customers on their devices at any time. This platform is targeted at media and entertainment companies and other businesses focused on delivering their digital products and services through the Internet. We also expect, through the VDMS platform, to support video initiatives and offerings, such as Fios and wireless, across the business. We have invested in converging technologies and services involving content delivery networks, video streaming and related consumer hardware to leverage new content models. Our wireless network enables us to move towards a unified video strategy that positions us to take advantage of this growth opportunity. We began using Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) technology to develop our LTE Multicast service. MBMS has the potential to enhance our network efficiency and provide our customers with access to high-quality live streaming video content. Internet of Things and Telematics The adoption of IoT technology continues to grow as companies across a wide range of industries are leveraging IoT technologies to increase efficiency, gain better customer insights, facilitate compliance and build new business models. IoT growth is expanding broadly, and adoption is particularly strong in the telematics and transportation industries in addition to the fields of smart communities, healthcare, utilities and energy management. We are building IoT capabilities by leveraging business models that monetize usage on our network at the connectivity, platform and solution layers. We have developed IoT solutions that address key market needs for electric and other utilities and pharmaceutical companies and others with complex supply chains. In addition, our IoT customers can turn the data that our solutions provide into actionable opportunities to develop new services and create revenue growth and manage costs.

We also offer end-to-end solutions to automotive OEMs in support of connected vehicle programs that provide value to consumers. Strategic Transactions In June 2015, we completed our acquisition of AOL Inc. (AOL), a leader in digital content and advertising. AOLs business model aligns with our approach, and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a digital advertising platform enhances our ability to further develop future revenue streams. In June 2017, we completed our acquisition of the operating business of Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo), a leader in search, communications, digital content and advertising. Additional discussion of the transaction is included in the 2018 Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report. We have established relationships with leading sports leagues to bring compelling content to our customers across our digital platforms. In December 2017, we entered into a multi-year partnership with the National Football League (NFL) in which Verizons portfolio of premium digital and mobile media properties, such as Yahoo Sports, stream in-market and national games, including national pre-season, regular season and playoff games, and the Super Bowl, to mobile phones. In January 2018, we entered into an innovative, multi-year partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA) that will deliver one of the most comprehensive video streaming offerings of NBA content - from live out-of-market games via NBA League Pass to highlights, fantasy basketball, original programming and more via Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Fantasy and across Verizons family of media brands. As part of the partnership, the NBA and Verizon will unveil a series of innovative collaborations leveraging Verizon's leading network and technology to deliver premium NBA content and unique fan experiences. Verizon also has rights to deliver leading soccer games, including La Liga and Liga MX, to its customers. We have also entered into content partnerships to realize synergies available within the marketplace. In April 2018, we entered into an agreement with Samsung in which our Gemini advertising platform became the exclusive provider of native digital advertising on Samsung mobile products on the Verizon network. In May 2018, Verizon selected Amazon Web Services, Inc. as its preferred public cloud provider. Also, in January 2019, Verizon Media entered into a multi-year global native advertising deal with Microsoft to provide marketers access to 20 percent more native advertising inventory through our Ad Platforms; and an exclusive search advertising partnership in which all search advertising across Verizon Media properties will be served by Microsoft Bing. Patents, Trademarks and Licenses We own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad. We also actively grant licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable the licensees to take advantage of the results of Verizons research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to us, we do not believe that the loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations. We periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, or cease offering the relevant products or services. Acquisitions and Divestitures Information about our acquisitions and divestitures is included in the 2018 Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders under the heading \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Acquisitions and Divestitures\" and in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report. Regulatory and Competitive Trends Regulatory and Competitive Landscape Verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market. Current and potential competitors include other voice and data service providers such as other wireless companies, traditional telephone companies, cable companies, Internet service providers, software and application providers, and other non-traditional companies. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth. Some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator. The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act or Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation. Federal Regulation Wireless Services The FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. Verizon anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. We can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential conditions. Today, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizons wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers, including construction and geographic coverage requirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 services, roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities. Broadband Verizon offers many different broadband services. Traditionally, the FCC recognized broadband Internet access services as \"information services\" subject to a \"light touch\" regulatory approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-style regulations. In 2015, the FCC declared that broadband Internet access services are \"telecommunications services\" subject to common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. In December 2017, the FCC adopted an order reversing the 2015 Title II Order to return to \"light touch\" regulation of broadband Internet access services. This order is currently being challenged in the courts. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains committed to the open Internet, which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want, and our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at http://responsibility.verizon.com/broadband-commitment. Wireline Voice Verizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be \"common carrier\" services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements. Video Verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has typically been required to obtain a franchise from local authorities. Privacy and Data Security We are subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business, including wireline, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in the media and IoT space. At the federal level, our voice business is subject to the FCC's privacy requirements. Oversight of broadband Internet access privacy and data security, which had shifted from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to the FCC following the FCC's adoption of its 2015 Title II Order, returned to the FTC as a result of the FCC's repeal of the 2015 Title II Order. Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at both the state and federal level, and several privacy-related bills have been introduced or are under considerations at each level. In addition, a new data protection regulation went into effect in Europe in May 2018 that includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and a new privacy law is scheduled to take effect in California in 2020. These laws could have a significant impact on certain of our businesses. Public Safety and Cybersecurity The FCC has played a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread availability of both media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks that have occurred or could occur in the future, however, the FCC or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers. Intercarrier Compensation and Network Access The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline \"business data services\" and other services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both makes and receives interconnection payments. In April 2017, the FCC issued an order, which is currently under appeal, that revised the regulatory structure for business data services, eliminating tariffing obligations and ex ante price regulations in markets the FCC determined to be competitive. The FCC has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates, terms and conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for business data services may be appropriate. State Regulation and Local Regulation Wireless Services The Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does not prohibit states from regulating the other \"terms and conditions\" of wireless service. For example, some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose reporting requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving) and taxation matters. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process. Wireline Services State public utility commissions regulate Verizons telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as an \"incumbent local exchange carrier\" in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated. In addition, as a video services operator in many states, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations, as a result. Environmental Matters Reserves have been established to cover environmental matters relating to discontinued businesses and past telecommunications activities. These reserves include funds to address contamination at the site of a former Sylvania facility in Hicksville, NY, which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. In September 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken primary responsibility for addressing the contamination at the site. An adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to the past and future expenses of all of the parties. Adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites requiring remediation. Executive Officers See Part III, Item 10. \"Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our executive officers. Employees As of December 31, 2018 , Verizon and its subsidiaries had approximately 144,500 employees. Labor unions represent approximately 23% of our employees.

Risk Factors ##TABLE_ENDThe following discussion of \"Risk Factors\" identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition or future performance. This information should be read in conjunction with \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations\" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. Operational Risks Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks, including through the use of malware, computer viruses, dedicated denial of services attacks, credential harvesting, social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers operations. Cyber attacks against companies, including Verizon, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. Further, the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. These attacks may be committed by company employees or external actors operating in any geography, including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective, and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states. Cyber attacks may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks, especially where disruption of service is an objective of the attacker. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to Verizon's operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future. The inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses to Verizon and/or a loss of market share to other communications providers. The costs associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. The potential costs associated with these attacks could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Further, certain of Verizons businesses, such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. Moreover, our increasing presence in the IoT industry with offerings of telematics products and services, including vehicle telematics, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services. In addition, a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information, such as financial data and sensitive or private personal information, could result in lawsuits and government claims, investigations or proceedings. Any of these occurrences could damage our reputation, adversely impact customer and investor confidence, and could further result in a material adverse effect on Verizons results of operation or financial condition. Natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. A natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. In addition, these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation. We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as fiber, switch and network equipment, smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. For example, our smartphone and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices. If these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers. We also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. Because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry. We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology. A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts. As of December 31, 2018 , approximately 23% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. While we have labor contracts in place with these unions, with subsequent negotiations we could incur additional costs and/or experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations. In addition, while less than 1% of the workforce of our wireless and other businesses outside of wireline is represented by unions, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in further organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our operations. Economic and Strategic Risks We face significant competition that may reduce our profits. We face significant competition in our industries. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, Internet, local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, application and device providers and providers of VoIP services. While these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. If we are unable to compete effectively, we could experience lower than expected revenues and earnings. A projected sustained decline in any of our reporting units' revenues and earnings could have a significant impact on its fair value and cause us to record goodwill impairment charges in the future. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a $4.6 billion ($4.5 billion after-tax) goodwill impairment charge on our Media reporting unit. The amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. In addition, wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided  in some cases specifically targeting Verizon Wireless customers. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industries, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits. If we are not able to adapt to changes and disruptions in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits. Our industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services. If our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. In addition to introducing new offerings and technologies, such as 5G technology, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services. Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the U.S. or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services, dropping down in price plans or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. Similarly, under these conditions, the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Legal and Regulatory Risks Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified products or services. We are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. New laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level, such as those described below, could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks and operate our Media and Telematics businesses, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. ##TABLE_START  Privacy and data protection - we are subject to federal, state and international laws related to privacy and data protection. A new data protection regulation, which went into effect in Europe in May 2018, includes significant penalties for non-compliance. A new privacy law scheduled to take effect in California in 2020, also could have a significant impact on certain of our businesses. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Regulation of broadband Internet access services - In its 2015 Title II Order, the FCC nullified its longstanding \"light touch\" approach to regulating broadband Internet access services and \"reclassified\" these services as telecommunications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation. The FCC repealed the 2015 Title II Order in December 2017, and returned to its traditional light-touch approach for these services. The 2017 order has been appealed to the D.C. Circuit; the outcome and timing of this appeal or any other challenge remains uncertain. Several states have also adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that would impose net neutrality and other requirements on some of our services (in some cases different from the FCCs 2015 rules). The enforceability and effect of these state rules is uncertain. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  \"Open Access\" - we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. Moreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services. ##TABLE_END The further regulation of broadband, wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks. We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims, property claims, and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. Financial Risks Verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if Verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt. As of December 31, 2018 , Verizon had approximately $103.0 billion of outstanding unsecured indebtedness, as well as approximately $9.4 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facility. Verizons debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: ##TABLE_START  requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt, which would reduce the funds Verizon has available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  making it more difficult or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  reducing Verizons flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industries and market conditions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  making Verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  exposing Verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that its debt obligations are at variable interest rates. ##TABLE_END Adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing. Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. With approximately 144,500 employees and approximately 195,000 retirees as of December 31, 2018 eligible to participate in Verizons benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, including the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding the potential modification of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities ##TABLE_ENDThe principal market for trading in the common stock of Verizon is the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"VZ\". As of December 31, 2018 , there were 630,756 shareholders of record. Stock Repurchases In March 2017, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of the Company's common stock. The program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, or at the close of business on February 28, 2020, whichever is sooner. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated transactions and on the open market, including through plans complying with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The timing and number of shares purchased under the program, if any, will depend on market conditions and the Companys capital allocation priorities. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , Verizon did no t repurchase any shares of Verizons common stock under our authorized share buyback programs. At December 31, 2018, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 100 million.
